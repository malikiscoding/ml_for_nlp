"AITA for falsely accusing a veteran of stolen valor, when she couldn't give any details about her service?","I (34m) served as a Captain in the Marine Corps. I have left the service, and right now I am doing an MBA. One of my classmates (31F), who we'll call ""J"", is very gentle, very soft-spoken and unassuming. J and I were working together on a case study once, and I started opening up to her about my military service and all the lessons that I've learnt from the Corps. J enthusiastically told me ""that's so cool! I was a Surface Warfare Officer in the Navy!"" 

I immediately felt suspicious about this claim. As I said, J is very demure, and she doesn't really have the bravado that is required in the military environment (at least, I feel like a certain amount of bravado is required). I still humored her, and began asking about the details of her military experience - where she deployed, what courses she went through, what ship she served on, etc etc. Suddenly J got all tight-lipped, and she couldn't say anything specific about military life. She kept making excuses along the lines of ""it just wasn't a good period of my life"" and ""I'd rather not talk about it"". Eventually I felt like I had done enough snooping around, and I bluntly told her that she was bullshitting, and that I'd rather not work with a phony.

I talked about this experience with my friend, M, at our school's veterans organization. I told M to be wary of anything J says. M responded by telling me that J did serve, he's seen her paperwork and ID and everything, and that in fact, one of her MBA recommendation letters was written by a retired rear admiral (O-8) who held J in high regard. Whoops.

The next time I met J, before our class started, I tried to act chummy towards her and make up for accusing her of being a liar. She laughed in my face and told me to ""pound sand, poolee"". And for those of you who don't know, yes, she was being derisive here.

AITA for eating the toppings off my bfs pizza,"Earlier tonight I ordered a Hawaiian pizza with my boyfriend. We’ve only been dating a month so it’s the first time I ate pizza with him. We only finished about half, and then we went to watch TV. I was still hungry, so I ate all the toppings off the pizza. 

When he saw, he absolutely flipped out. He said that he was saving it for lunch tomorrow, that he had never met anyone who would do anything like this, and was just generally really upset. I thought he was joking and laughed it off, but it’s been a couple hours and he is still upset. He’s talking about how he was looking forwards to having the leftover pizza for lunch, and now I’ve ruined his lunch.

I offered to buy him another pizza, but he kept saying that it wasn’t about that, and I just ruined his day.

AITA for telling my girlfriend that I told her so after one of her male friends tried to get with her?,"My girlfriend and I have been together for about a year now. My girlfriend has more than a few guy friends, and I'm not one of those guys that thinks men and women can't be friends. However, with 2 of these guys, it's very clear that they want more than just friendship from her.  Like clear as day to the point where I don't get how she doesn't see it. If I can notice just by the weird energy they try to exude when I'm present, she should  be able to get too right? Wrong.

Any time I have pointed this out, she gets upset with me. She tells me that I am being jealous and reading into things, that aren't there. I argue back that I'm just letting her know and as a guy, I can probably tell much better than she can since women tend to be a little slow regarding things like this. So 2 nights ago night, she was hanging out with her friends and this guy was present. From what she told me, they were all drinking and he said some things that implied he'd want to be with her. She was made uncomfortable by this and the night ended shortly after.

Fast forward to yesterday morning. She got a series of texts apologizing for what he said, and then backpedaling and saying he would treat her so much better than me and she's wasting her time with me. She of course said no and was upset with him. After she told me, I just read the texts and simply said, ""Wow who could've seen this coming"" a bit sarcastically. 

This set her off and she got mad. She said that I was being such a huge asshole to her and she had no way of seeing this coming. She's been pissed at me since.

"AITA for blowing up at my husband for sharing pics of our daughter's birthday celebration, resulting in my family finding out about it?","
Eversince my brother passed away at the age of 17 on his birthday, My family decided to never celebrate birthdays ever again. It was mom & dad's decision; but because of how much the family loved my brother, extended family decided to do the same and stand in agreement with this decision.


My husband would refuse to follow this decision, and kept celebrating his birthday. Me and the family didn't say a thing about it since he's not blood family. But when I first got pregnant, the argument about celebrating our daughter's birthdays occured. My family adviced me to just not celebrate her birthday since she's a baby and won't even remember anyway. I agreed but my husband threw a fit and insisted that we celebrate our daughter's 1st birthday. I caved in eventually but told him we'd have a small, secret celebration so that my family wouldn't find out. He agreed.

The next day, I got a call from mom and she was so upset saying that my word meant nothing and that I have no respect for my brother's memory nor the family. I asked what she meant and she told me she saw the birthday party pics my husband posted on social media. I was to shocked to even argue. I hung up and went straight to my husband to confront him about it. He got defensive and said that he didn't need my permission to post pics, and that he wanted to show his family the birthday celebration pics since I ""insisted"" we have a small, secret party and ""exclude"" them. I explained to him how this made me look bad and a liar to my family but he said ""they can get over it"" and called my mom ""snooby"". I blew up at him and we had a huge fight about it. He started sulking later and said I ruined the memory of our daughter's first birthday for him and ""verbally abused"" him with how I lashed out. But I solely did it out of frusrtation knowing that what happened caused a massive problem between me and family.


Now he's expecting an apology from me.

AITA for not allowing my son to go to his school dance?,"My husband (51M) and I (48F) have 6 children (19M, 16F, 14F, 13M, 11M, + 5F), Our 16 y/o, Gianna is a junior in high school, our son Ryker (13) is in 7th grade.

The kids are starting to have their school dances, the 7th grade dance is later this month and the junior banquet is in early May. We have gone shopping for dress clothes for all the dances. We bought Gianna’s dress a few weeks ago.

Gianna has usually been a good kid throughout her life, this school year has been slightly harder than others though. Around 2 months ago, we got a call from Gianna’s choir teacher saying that Gianna and a few other altos were making racist jokes about some of the new pieces she introduced, including an Urdu song and a song from Honduras.

We talked to Gianna about her actions and we made her write an apology to her teacher as well as write a 5 paragraph essay on why it is important to respect music from other cultures.

Ryker has a friend from his baseball team who is Honduran (he was born here but his mom was born in Honduras and his dad is mixed), when Ryker heard out about this he was quite mad and asked if he could have his friend come over, and teach her about the culture there. We allowed this and he came over with his parents and they made food and Ryker and his friend taled about sports and music there, Gianna was very clearly not enjoying it but we made her engage anyways.

Our daughter and a group of her friends, including her boyfriend,  got in trouble last week for making racist jokes again. We took her phone to investigate to see where this hatred could be coming from.

Ryker had his friends over for a sleepover the night we found out about this, during dinner the boys were talking about how their coach would never let them live though it if they bullied a kid or made racist jokes. My husband and I tried helping guide them through their feelings, like asking them about the diverse athletes they liked.

Gianna was hanging out with friends at the mall that night, some of whom were doing dress shopping for the upcoming dance.

Our son and the boys decided to use this as an opportunity to trash the dress, using mud, drinks and cutting a few holes in the dress. We found out when Gianna came home, entered her room and saw the dress.

The boys were laughing and Ryker said they did it because Gianna didn’t deserve to go to the banquet, and saying how there “could be kids that look like” his Honduan friend.

We told Ryker we were trying our best to educate her in a very white town (we’re also white). We told him that this was the wrong way to take out his anger and that as a result, he couldn’t go to his 7th grade dance. Ryker told us to shut up and spent the rest of his night in his room with the boys.

Ryker texted my parents and siblings as well as my in-laws, a few have called us and came to his defense, saying he’s just a kid who was trying to cope with anger. Now we’re unsure if we are in the wrong. AITA?

&#x200B;

Update:

Hello, I first want to thank everyone for the advice, yesterday was insane processing just how many comments I got and also talking to family including my siblings, parents and in-laws about where to go from here.

I get it, my husband and I were in the wrong. We first talked to Ryker, He told us how mad he was at Gianna, he told us about how some girls in his middle school have been racist towards his friend so he wanted to protect him. He told us him and his friends made the plot together bc they felt like she could hurt someone if she didn’t face backlash. We asked him if he regretted his decision purely to see his mood, he immediately said no. We did go over anger management though.

We then talked to Gianna and things went much worse than we expected, she defended herself and used much worse language than what she got in trouble at school for. She used slurs and called Ryker a crybaby.

My family and my husband’s family all live close to us. We decided to have dinner with my siblings, parents and in-laws. We asked for advice, discussed everything, and had them question Gianna and Ryker some more. Again, Gianna expressed much worse sentiments than we could have ever imagined. Ryker was more put together, and went into depth about his feelings.

After our families had left, my husband and I went in our bedroom to discuss what punishments would be.

We first spoke to Ryker, we told him he could go to the dance and then discussed the money with him, we decided to not make him pay for financial damages to us but we asked him how he felt if he bought something with his hard earned money from gold caddying, he eventually said he understood our initial anger after that thought experiment. Off the recommendations of my brother, we also suggested looking into how he could channel his desire for social justice into sports, the most important thing in Ryker’s life besides his friends.

We then talked to Gianna, we told her she would not be attending the junior banquet and told her she would have to read and write a report on 2 books from a list of books on racism, some commentators have made recommendations and we will look into them. She has also lost all of her devices except her school chromebook until further notice.

We also apologized to Ryker for holding him to higher standards simply because he’s the high achiever of the family. He also mentioned the fact we don’t give him enough attention because of that.

We are looking into different therapies such as family therapy or individual therapy for Gianna, possibly Ryker and even our other kids.

AITA for keeping my brothers life insurance,"I, 40M, lost my brother, 42M “Jay” in a car accident a few months ago. Growing up, he was the golden child. He got a full ride to a prestigious college while I had to pay my own way and eventually drop out. He went on to grad school, but I got married and settled down with my wife, 42F, “Brittany” early on. We have had financial struggles which caused us to not be able to start a family. We live paycheck to paycheck in a one bedroom apartment. Jay always made good money, but wasn’t lucky in love. He was very picky and while he had some longer 1-2 year relationships, he was looking for perfection before getting married. He finally married his wife, 40F, Mary, in 2019. She also made good money, like Jay. She also had 2 children from a previous relationship, now 18 and 19. One is in college and the other will be starting next year. She and Jay also had twin girls about a year ago. Mary and Jay both worked, and have a nanny they share with a neighbor for their girls. When they got pregnant, she sold her house where they were living and he sold his condo that he had been renting out and they bought a larger family home together. All this to say money is not a problem for them. 

Like I said, Jay passed away recently in a car accident and Mary found out that I was the beneficiary of his 401(k) and life insurance policy through his employer. The life insurance is 150k but the 401k is much more substantial. He set it up that way years ago before Mary was in the picture and never changed it. 

Mary begged me to give her a portion of the money but I said no. She inherited his part of their house, and their joint savings account which is about 50k. She said that she paid for his funeral, and to make it work on her income alone, she will have to sell the house, give up the nanny, put the girls in daycare, and won’t be able to help her older kids with college the way they planned. 

I told her it’s not my fault. If he wanted to change the beneficiary, he should have done that. But he didn’t so now the money is mine. My wife and I plan to use the money to buy a home and finally start a family. She says her husbands money should go to his children, but she doesn’t see that me using the money to have my own children is more important. 

Our parents think I’m an a hole because the money should go to his kids. I offered to take 50k and put it in trust for the girls education. But they said Mary needs the money now. They said the life insurance would pay off their mortgage and the boys college and put money away for the girls future, and her income would cover the rest so they wouldn’t have to move. But what about my family?",Asshole
AITA for having a dry wedding and serving only water for drinks?,"Throwaway only cause I don't want this on my main.

Ok so basically my husband and I are getting married later this year. Each of our sides of the family are fairly big. It will be around 100-150 people total. My husband and I are paying for this all ourselves, as well as my grandma who said she doesn't care one way or the other on this issue. She just loves weddings.

We have a lot of kids in our family so we decided against making it child-free but we did decide to make it dry. So there will be no alcohol of any kind at our wedding. Honestly, this doesn't have anything to do with there being kids there but due to the fact that my fiancé and I don't drink. Nothing against people who do, it's just not for us and we don't want to. On top of that, we only really drink water. We rarely, if ever, drink soda so most of the time it's only water with the occasional juice and milk. We don't even drink coffee. 

So obviously the food (which is a part my grandma is not paying for) is going to be expensive for that many people. We are having our wedding catered so everyone will have a good choice of food to choose from but to drink only water will be provided. We don't want to have to pay for alcohol or soda, it is just an large added expense when we can just do filtered water for a MUCH cheaper cost.

Well, when family and friends found out being got angry. Some didn't really care but some are really upset about it. Saying that I can just have an open bar so I don't have to pay for drinks (we could, but still have to pay for the bartender and we just really don't want to bother with alcohol there). Or we should at least have soda because how can we expect everyone to drink ONLY water? The kids will be upset. The wedding will be boring. That this is not how weddings work. Etc.

So AITA? I didn't think this would be a problem! It's only water. I mean, don't most people drink water everyday anyway? Should we pay the extra to have soda to make the family happy?",Asshole
AITA for wanting to limit my BIL’s access to my unborn daughter because of his dating choices?,"Dummy account because the relevant parties are on Reddit.

I (31 F) am pregnant with a girl. My husband
(33) has a younger brother (31) whose he's very close to. However I recently told my husband that I don't feel comfortable with the idea of his brother spending much time with my daughter
once she's born. It's not because of my BIL himself. We're not close but he's fine. The issue is his life choices.

He's not married, has no intention of getting married or having kids, and dates only for sexual purpose. He dates multiple women and the only thing he has in common with them is that, like him, they are extremely good looking. He's highly intelligent, yet he has no interest in meaningful relationships. I spoke to him about his choices a few years ago, and after accusing me of being
'moralistic', he claims that he always uses protection and he never leads the women on. Which I call BS on, as I can't imagine
any woman with an increasing ticking biological clock would willingly be in a relationship which she knows doesn't have a future. Not to mention, what woman would want to be with someone
who may not even remember your name in a year's time?

I mentioned this to my husband, however he called me an AH, and said that it was ridiculous to limit our daughter's access with her uncle just because I don't agree with his legal dating choices.

AITA?


EDIT: I probably should have clarified that he generally goes onto apps like Tinder. Which makes it worst, as the women he dates tend to be of a certain type.",Asshole
AITA for telling my girlfriend that I’m not going to drop everything to take her to the hospital anytime she feels any discomfort?,"*I’ll try to remain as least biased as I can.*

I (27M) and my girlfriend (21F) are expecting our first baby at the beginning of May. This pregnancy has been nothing short of chaotic. My girlfriend has never experienced pregnancy and she’s terrified to give birth, so any feeling of discomfort she freaks out. I understand that pregnancy is hard and scary, and my girlfriend doesn’t have her family around to help her, so she’s probably experiencing a lot of anxiety. I’m not trying to downplay that. I’m frustrated because I feel like she’s taking advantage of the fact that she can get me to do things for her just because she’s pregnant. 

We got into a fight a few days ago. She insisted that she didn’t feel good, and she thought something was wrong with the baby. She wanted to go to the hospital to make sure everything was okay. We’ve been to the hospital for this kind of “emergency” almost four times since the beginning of her pregnancy. I had to go to work because we are severely understaffed, so I told her that if she still didn’t feel good tonight we could go make sure everything was okay. She got upset with me, and she told me that I never take her pain serious. I told her that I can’t drop everything any time she feels any discomfort. Pregnancy is uncomfortable. We argued some more then I left for work. When I got home I asked if she was feeling better, but she wouldn’t tell me. She has stopped talking to me about her pregnancy now, and I feel like she is being manipulative. She’s withholding information about my child because I didn’t drop everything to take her to the hospital, again. I tried explaining to her my side of things and I apologized, but she’s still mad at me. 

My girlfriend is treating me like I’m the asshole, but I feel like she isn’t seeing how frustrated and tired I am from dropping everything for her. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for manspreading on a plane?,"A few months ago I (26M) was alone on a long flight, \~6 hours. I had a middle seat between a young woman (20sF) in the window seat, and a woman (30sF) on the aisle. I'm tall and am never comfortable on planes. My knees always dig into the seat in front and it can be quite painful. I usually try to take a walk around the airport before flights to stretch my legs, but neglected to this time. It was Spirit airlines so even less legroom than usual.

About half an hour after takeoff I found my left knee inching to the side for the sweet relief of open space -- specifically, the no-man's-land in between seats, level with the shared armrest. But I wasn't paying attention to my knee the entire time. I'll concede it's possible that at some point I was occupying space that rightfully belonged to my window seat neighbor. All was well for \~2 hours.

At this point, the woman in the window seat called over the flight attendant. She asked her something like ""Could you tell him to keep his \*\*\*\*ing leg in his own \*\*\*\*ing seat."" With horror, I understood she was talking about me. I instantly retracted my leg in deep shame. She added something about ""his enormous dick"" -- my understanding was that it was meant to be a snide reference to the idea that spreading your legs is about male genital comfort. But she wasn't speaking very clearly, and the flight attendant (50sF) didn't seem to understand her. The FA asked her some sort of clarifying question but she didn’t answer and eventually the attendant went away.

I had been shocked into silence, but when the FA left I frantically began to apologize. But she refused to speak to me. She acted like she didn't hear me. Instead she started furiously texting on her phone (yeah, texting during a flight. I thought it was weird too). Aisle Seat woman said she had some extra space on her side I could use, but then promptly went to sleep. Oh well.

I tried again to apologize to Window Seat woman, but again she ignored me. I went from embarrassed to confused. I kept replaying it in my head, wondering why she didn't simply ask me to move my knee instead of calling over the attendant.

I started sneaking peeks at her phone. My defense is that I was baffled by her behavior and wanted answers. I'll admit that I was being judgmental, too. Here's why: she spent the last 3 hours of the flight watching tiktoks about shaming obese people and texting someone she called papi. I didn't see all of it but a significant portion was definitely about me; she wrote ""Men really do be too much sometimes"" with a laughing emoji.

She ignored me the whole rest of the flight and I ignored her. I got a good but painful workout of whatever muscle it is that keeps your knees together.",Asshole
AITA for forcing my stepdaughter to pay me back after she ruined my house?,"**AN UPDATE HAS BEEN POSTED**

I (43F) and my husband (47M) have been married for 4 years now.  We both have children from our previous marriages, (12M) and (10M) and “O” (18F).  My husband and I dated for 3 years prior to getting married but moved in all together 2 years ago.  

O lives with us full time and it had a bit of a rocky start with mine and O’s relationship but we managed to push through it.  I told O from day one that I wasn’t her mom but if there was anything she wants to talk about or need, she can come to me.  After a few months, we became quite close and she talked to me about anything she was too embarrassed to talk about with her dad.

Recently, O has been trying to make friends at College since she just started in the spring.  On campus residence is very expensive for the college and its close to our house so O decided to stay at home. That’s not a problem, the problem is that O keeps bringing her friends over to hangout but living it a mess.  

Normally it’s not a major deal (I have OCD so sometimes there is issues depending on the situation though) because she picks up after herself but I recently hired a housekeeper to clean the house once a week since I’ve been working overtime more often and me and my husband just don’t have time.  It is expensive but I cannot stand it when it becomes too messy for me so I think it’s worth it.  

This time she brought her friends over after the house was cleaned and I guess they decided not take their shoes off and walked all around the house leaving footprints.  They also made pizza from scratch and left the crumbles on the counters among other things.  They pretty much made the entire house filthy before I could even come home. 

Once again, the cleaning service is quite expensive because I like a higher level of cleaning quality so I was pissed.  My husband is trying to make me let it go because O has always struggled making friends but I can’t let it go because of how much it cost.  I requested the exact amount I paid for the cleaning service to her Venmo and she acted all confused on why she had to pay for it.  I explained that her and her friends ruined my house that was just cleaned but she insisted it wasn’t her.

I have a ring camera and I have video proof of her and her friends going into the house and they were the only ones home that day before me.  I gave her two choices, pay for the damages or I stop paying for her phone.  She’s complaining saying it wasn’t her and she doesn’t have the money to pay the phone bill.  AITA?

EDIT TO CLEAR CONFUSION: The cleaners came before O, fully cleaned the house then left and an hour later O came in with her friends.",Asshole
AITA for lying to my wife as a joke about what AWD means,"My (27M) wife (27F) is very into feminism and I often joke about it and she does not seem to mind. Like I believe in equality and all and don't criticize her view or anything.

My wife was having car troubles with the engine of her old car and her mechanic convinced her they were going to get worse and advised her to get another car. I thought it could do more years but she still decided to sell it without getting a second opinion. Her mechanic is actually a woman and she trusts her for that reason and she thinks she is a great mechanic.

My wife sold her old car and got bought a used one that was much newer from a lady. She bought it because she 'fell in love with the color' and thought it 'looked cute'. It is a fine car and I have no issues with it but it just seemed like an odd reason to get a car to me.

The car has an AWD badge on it and as we were driving back after she bought it, she asked me why it says AWD. I joked and said it was something they put on and it is a club called Association of Woman Drivers were women get together to talk about their cars and car troubles and help each other.

I thought she would realize it was a joke but she took me seriously so I didn't say anything and tried not to laugh. She said she would consider joining it.

When we got home, she googled it and realized I was joking but she got really upset and called me an AH.  I don't get why she is so offended by such a small joke as I would have told her eventually what it means.",Asshole
AITA for giving away an expensive KitchenAid standmixer my dad got me for my birthday that i thought looked extremely ugly?,"Background: for my 24th birthday, my dad got me a grey metal KitchenAid standmixer for my apartment. It was about $700 I think. However, I did NOT ask for this and honestly I freaking hate the color as it does not match anything in my place and it's also too big. I gave it to my friend who liked it and was moving to a different state. My boyfriend then got me a cute black standmixer that fit into my apartment a lot better so that's what I have.

My dad was over last night and he noticed that the grey standmixer was gone and replaced by the black one. He asked where it was and I told him the truth (namely, that I thought the grey was ugly so I gave it to my friend and my boyfriend got me the black one instead).

My dad was shocked and said the grey standmixer had cost a lot and that he thought I would have liked it so that's why he gave it to me as a present. Maybe here's where I'm the AH: I said if he would have been more observant, he would have known that I absolutely hate the color grey (it's my least favorite color) and everyone in my life who knows me knows that.

I honestly wasn't trying to be rude, I was just stating a fact. But my mom called me today and told me I really hurt my dad and need to apologize for ""throwing away"" a thoughtful birthday gift my dad had put a lot of money and thought into.

I don't think that's necessary, I think after my dad gave me the standmixer, it became mine and I could do anything with it. And I didn't ""throw it away"", I gave it to a friend.

So AITA?

edit: okay so clearly I'm the asshole. I'll apologize to my dad. I didn't think it was such a big deal. But clearly I'm wrong. To explain some things: 1) I didn't say the ""observant"" comment to hurt him, he kept saying he picked out grey because it matches everything (which it does not) so that's why I elaborated on me hating grey 2) literally everyone I'm close with (except my dad I guess) knows I HATE grey. It's almost a running joke at this point 3) my friend is really into cooking/baking and I wanted to give her a moving-away gift, she's not just some ""rando"" person I gave it to",Asshole
AITA for going to work while my wife was having her appendix out?,"My (31m) wife (32f) was having a ton of really bad abdominal pain last weekend. I drove her to urgent care Saturday morning--she didn't want to go but I basically made her. Urgent care made her go to the ER where they determined that her appendix needed to come out that day.

She called her mom before surgery. Her mom must have told both of my parents as well because all three (her mom and my mom and dad) ended up at the hospital to be with her during her surgery.

Now; here's where the conflict lies...I was scheduled for work at 5pm that night. I've just started a new job that pays well.  I only started it a couple of weeks ago so I am brand new at it. I didn't want to call in. They probably would have been cool with it given the circumstances but I still didn't want to do it. I didn't even have the PTO for it; I would have either had to take the day unpaid or gone negative on my PTO. So, while my wife was having the surgery I went into work and pulled my shift.

My wife is upset with me. She is accusing me of ""abandoning"" her. But I think that is unfair. She was having a completely routine surgery and she had plenty of company and support. It was unfortunate that I couldn't be there and I feel bad about it but it's not as if I'm a surgeon and could have made a difference. I had to work, period, and I'm too new there to call in. The timing sucked but my wife's health outcomes were the same either way.

AITA for coddling my 2yo when i didn't do the same for my oldest?,"I know the text makes me an AH, and it's probably right. When i (34M) was 20, i had a relationship with a girl, let's call her Clara. When she got pregnant, i honestly wasn't happy, but since she was decided to keep the baby there wasn't anything i could do. When our daughter, let's say Sadie (13F) was born, i legally recognized her. We have shared custody, and she stays with me 2 weekends a month. I also pay child support. I go to her school events, holidays etc. But if i'm honest, i don't feel like i love her and i know that that makes me the AH. I care about her, but i don't miss her when she is not with me and i don't feel the need to see her.

Clara and sadie both disliked my wife, but that didn't stopped me and we got married. We now have 2 kids, 4M and 2F. With my younger kids it was completely different for me, i loved since the first moment i knew they existed and that love grows every day since they were born. 

Sadie comes to our house 2 weekends a month, but she hates my wife and my toddlers. I don't allow her to speak badly to them, i told her she has the right to not have a relationship with them, but she has to respect them. My wife has no problem with sadie and never complained about her. My kids mostly ignore her, but they act like this with everyone who won't play with them, since at this age they don't have other interests.

My half sister, who is a friend of Clara, came to visit us and stayed with us for a few days. My HS doesn't like my wife because she wanted me to marry clara. We were nc for a few years, but my wife, who wants everyone to have a good relationship, convinced me to let her back into our lives.
 
Before leaving she got in a fight with me, saying that i coddle my 2yo way too much and how horrible i'm for not doing that for sadie too. It is true that my 2yo is a total daddy's girl and if i'm home she always follows me around and wants to be near me. She often asks for cuddles and hugs and i'm happy to give them to her. Same with my son, but my sister wasn't disturbed by me cuddling my son, just my daughter. She was always obssesed by daddy's girl figure, since she was never that with my dad (long story). 

She said i'm an AH, because since sadie wasn't a daddy's girl,  my 2yo shouldn't be either. I told her that while i'm not a good father for sadie, even  if i'm and always was present in her life, it doesn't mean that i shouldn't love my youngest daughter. Am i the asshole for coddling my 2yo, even if i didn't do the same for my oldest??",Asshole
AITA for using my dishwasher as a storage space and still expecting my partner to do dishes?,"

Long story short I'm a little neurotic and don't think dishwashers are good for dishes. I also don't trust my partner to not put any of my nice kitchen stuff in the dishwasher that should be hand washed while I'm gone. My partner said, well before we moved in together, that in our house he wants to be able to use the dishwasher otherwise he won't do any dishes.

So we move in together and I end up using the dishwasher to store shaker bottles and plastic items, and for the past several months have been washing all of his dishes by hand. I'm so tired of it though and believe he can wash a few dishes every now and then to help me out. He points out that he already told me if he can't use the dishwasher he's not doing any dishes, but washing a dish by hand doesn't take long.

AITA for demolishing my daughter's room after she moved out?,"My 18 yr old daughter, Meg, is in college. She moved in with her boyfriend a few months ago, which left her old bedroom empty. 

Her bedroom used to be right next to our tiny living room. To make our tiny living room into a normal sized living room, we knocked out my daughter's room's wall, refloored the space and fixed the walls. Now it looks like the bedroom was never there and we have a spacious living room.

When my daughter came home to visit and saw that her room is gone, she made a huge deal about it. She got all emotional and said if we never wanted to let her move back, we should've just said so instead of completely demolishing her room.

I told her that if anything happens and she needs to move back, we will welcome her and she could sleep on the couch as long as she wants. But she accused us of wanting to get rid of her forever and for her to never visit us since we got rid of her room so fast, only a few months after she moved out and we should've waited longer.

AITA for getting my daughter an apartment vs letting her move back in?,"My (45F) daughter, Mallory (24F) got married 3 years ago. She has two children (2 & 6 months). Recently, her husband revealed he’s been cheating on her and is leaving her for another woman. They rent a house but due to my daughter having no credit at the time of moving in, only his name is on the lease. He is giving her 30 days to move out. 

Mallory is understandably distraught. I’ve been doing all I can to comfort her. She asked if she could move in with me, explaining she’d have the kids every other week. She assured me she isn’t looking for childcare. Both kids are in daycare. She offered to pay rent and chip in on groceries. 

Now, I have always raised my kids to be independent. I didn’t kick them out at 18, but I did encourage them to start doing things on their own. Mallory moved out at 19 (moving in with her soon to be ex), my sons are in college and plan to move out after graduating from college (they’re both freshmen at the same university). 

I asked Mallory how her credit score was. She said she could reasonably rent. I offered to pay first month, last month and a deposit, along with 6 months rent. She said it’s not about the money. She’s not wealthy by any means but she does well for herself and her husband is already agreeing to give her money weekly, even before they go to court. She just wants emotional support.

I told her I could do that with her living in her own place. She started to cry and said she just needs her mom right now. I told her she was going to be okay.

My sons are pissed with me. They pointed out I have plenty of room, that Mallory has offered to pay rent. She’s also not the type to shrug off responsibility of the kids and the toddler is well behaved. To me, that doesn’t matter. They called me heartless.

AITA for telling my brother that he didn't need to share that his wife was in labor in my wedding?,"

My wedding was days ago. My brother attended but his wife didn't. She was nearing her due date to give birth and she didn't come. The wedding was going well. Til my brother recieved a call from his mil telling him that sil was in labor. He told me he was leaving and my wife and I were fine with that but the issue began after he had told one of the guests that sil was in labor. Word spread out and suddenly, everybody was talking about it which disrupted the event. Even my parents started calling and there was a huge fuss which frankly, was unnecessary if my brother just left in silence or made up some excuse.

I contacted him later and expressed my grief and frustration with what he did. I told him how the news of his wife being in labor disrupted the wedding and caused my wife to feel like her day was ruined. He lashed out asking how any of that was his fault. I explained how he should've just left or made up some excuse to leave but he said he didn't mean any harm and that he was in a hurry and worried at the time. He said it wasn't like he announced it and told me I disrespected him by arguing with him about it. We had a big argument and our parents sided with him and told me to 'get over myself' and are now expecting me to apologize.

AITA for being mad at my fiance because he told me he wouldn't add my name to the house after we get married?,"My fiance (28M) and I (26F) started dating 3 years ago and I can't wait to be with him for the rest of my life but I think I might have messed up. We got engaged 3 months ago and are planning on getting married in November and last night we were discussing some things about the wedding and the topic of our finical plan for once we are married which is where the argument started cause I asked him when I would be added onto the deed for the house.

Background: When my fiance was 23 his uncle died and left him a huge inheritance which has basically set him up for life, especially since he doesn't like super flashy things and only really spends money on his hobbies, and for the first 2 years after he struggled to date because he was always worried the girl he was dating was using him.

I moved in with fiance a year into our relationship and he has never charged me for any bills and only expects me to pay for an luxury items I want, 9 months ago me and my fiance had a discussion in which he asked me if I wanted to stop working because I worked as a teacher and he could tell that my work wasn't making me happy, which he was right, we came to the agreement that I would stop working and some ground rules. The ground rules include that he would give me allowance every month and that he expected me to not just sit at home all day on my phone because he wants me to find hobbies and passions because we both don't want children. I was totally on board with the rules and quitting really helped my mental health.

So when I brought up having my name added to the house deed he got really quiet. He told me that he didnt feel comfortable adding my name to the deed as the house had been fully paid off by him before we had even met and he felt that he is the one responsible for all the payments. This made me upset because I thought he was trying to say that I was using him and we are getting married so I thought the house would become ""ours"". He told me that things will become ours but this was the first house he ever bought and that he wanted to keep something for himself. He told me that if we decide to change houses or have one built, which we have discussed before, that he would have both our names put on the deed. This made me more upset because if he is willing to do it on the possible next house why cant he do for our current house? We got into an argument and I left to go to my sister's apartment and texted my friend about the situation and she told me that I was being an AH and overreacting but I don't see it that way and I think he should be willing to put my name on the deed.

Am I overreacting and throwing away a good relationship? Or is he being an AH by not seeing my side?

Edit: I just woke up after posting this last night and have been reading through a lot of the comments and I know that I messed up and I'm already planning on apologizing to my fiance. I wanted to answer some common questions people were asking me. I called the money my fiance gives me an ""allowance"" and some people said that it was a red flag, that is the word I use to describe it but its really more of a salary as my fiance has me listed as an employee at one of his companies to make it all legal and so that I can have health insurance and it is all in a legal contract, his idea, that protects me incase we do split up. My allowance is 5 grand a month which I know is a lot and I'm realizing that my fiance has put me in financial position most people would die for and I need to acknowledge that. Some people have also talked about how much money my fiance has, I dont know the exact number but he has told me the range and shown me his finances and has told me based of off what we spend now we could live this way for another 100 years. I will talk about a prenup with him if he stills wants to be together.",Asshole
AITA? I want my son to stop playing sports,"Fake account. I 42M have 1 son with my ex wife. We have been divorced for 9 years. She has a full custody.  I get him every other weekend.  

My issue is that he has played soccer and bowling for years.  It has interfered with my time.  He seems to have something every Saturday.  

I asked his mom if he can take a break. She told me if I wanted him not to play I have to tell him.

So I called my son he is 13. I told him that him playing sports is taking too much of my time. Plus I don't like that he has broken 2 bones. And countless  bruises and scrapes. I am afraid people will  think he is abused. Just 2 weeks ago he showed up with 3 cuts on his legs. When I asked his mom she was like who knows he is always out and about. 

So after I told him. He basically said he wants to keep playing that soccer is his favorite and bowling is fun too.  He basically told me I never go anyway so it's no big deal. Now he is right. I never played sports so I don't get the fun. 

I called his mom and said he wants to play but I won't contribute anymore. 

I did say again that I don't like the idea of him playing. He has broken 2 bones. I did tell her I may consider talking to a lawyer. She laughed.

AITA for wearing an Iron Maiden T-Shirt to my first meeting with my girlfriend's parents?,"I (28m) have been dating my girlfriend (23f) for a few months. Things have gone well; we get along well so far and I really care about her and hope things work out with us.

Anyway she recently invited me to come over and have dinner with her parents at their home.  She still lives with them for now. We are getting more serious and they wanted to meet me. If it's relevant her parents are Indian immigrants to the US and I am white.

So, I thought it was a completely casual meeting and I wore an Iron Maiden T-shirt. I do happen to like the band but that's not even why I wore it; that's just how I dress and that shirt just happened to be clean that day. I went and met her parents and thought we'd had a good meeting.

However my girlfriend is NOT happy with me. She feels as if me dressing in a T-Shirt rather than a nicer button-up shirt was bad enough, but that wearing a shirt with skulls on it was--in her words--""just obnoxious.""

I honestly just dressed for the meeting the way I usually do and didn't even think about it. I think that if she had certain standards that she should have communicated them to me beforehand.

AITA For Asking For More Money For My Car?,"So, I (28 M) offered to sell my RAV4 that has 100,000 miles on it in January to my brother and his wife. They have a baby and a beat up Honda civic as well as a Scion with way too many miles on it. They shared they’d be car hunting this year. 

I offered to sell it to them for what Carvana offered (which was $14,500) and they agreed to it right away. The problem was that my wife and I still hadn’t picked out our replacement car.

So, they’d check in every week or so but we weren’t ready. In the end, we decided to hold onto the car until our trip to Disney this past week. 

I checked Carvana again and they offered me more. This time $16,500. I texted my brother telling him he could have it but he would need to match Carvana’s new offer. 

He responded saying that they’re not haggling and they’ve been putting off buying a car for months because they thought we had an agreement and were just waiting on us. They called me an AH for stringing them along for 3 months and then asking for $2000 more.

AITA For Asking My Husband to Include Our Children When Spending Time with His Estranged Son?,"   I am a 45-year-old woman who has been married to my husband, Fred, for 20 years. We have four children, including my 24-year-old stepson, James. When Fred and I first met, he was still married to James' mother, Lily. We fell in love, but we didn't do anything physical until after their divorce was final.
   
I met James when he was five years old, and over the almost 20 years that I have known him, he has never liked me. Despite my best efforts to build a relationship with him, he has never shown any interest in getting to know me or his siblings.
   
When James turned 18, he left home, and while he would occasionally call and spend time with Fred, he would never do so with me or our children. Recently, I asked Fred to include our children when he spends time with James, but James has not spoken to him since.
   
Now, my mother-in-law, who has always favored Lily over me, has called me and accused me of being the AH for hurting James and Fred's relationship ""even further.""
  
 I understand that my request may have hurt James' feelings, but after almost two decades of trying to build a relationship with him, I feel that I have exhausted all other options. I love my husband and our children, and I want them to feel included and valued in our family. It's not fair for James to exclude them from his life with Fred simply because he has a strained relationship with me.
   
I believe that it's important for families to come together and support one another, especially during difficult times. James is a part of our family, and I want him to know that he is welcome to spend time with us, but not at the expense of my children's feelings or our family dynamic.
  
 I understand that James may be hurt, but I hope that he can see that our family is important to us, and that we want him to be a part of it.",Asshole
"AITA For Telling My Daughter She Can’t Move 1,000+ Miles Away To Live With Her Girlfriend?","A friend at work pointed me to this to get some more advice/points of view on my situation.

I (46F) am the mother to two wonderful children, Andrew (16M) and Nicole (21F). Nicole was very bright as a child and excelled in her classes, and she headed into college with a plan to get a Master’s at least. I never had to worry about her doing well or hitting milestones, but the last few years have been very surprising. She became a bit withdrawn in her teen years, more so than I realized until now, and after her first year of college she suddenly moved out from a relative’s home and got her own apartment. Then, after her second year of college (last May) she told me and her father (58M) that she was dropping out and might return in a year, but wasn’t sure, and that she was incredibly stressed and depressed and had been for years. It felt like it was coming out of nowhere. 

Last fall she got a full time job and started talking about how she was happy and finally in a good routine and that she loved working. I was glad things were at least going well for her now, but still hoping she’d return to college soon. One of the biggest recent bombshells she dropped on me though was a month ago when I drove to visit her. We went out for lunch, and we started talking about this friend (25F) of hers. Eventually, my daughter admitted to me that she was a lesbian, and that she and this girl had been dating since January and that she FLEW TO MEET HER WITHOUT TELLING ME OR HER FATHER! Mind you, she flew over 1,000 miles to see this girl that she had NEVER MET and had only called and video chatted with for a few months. I was shocked and angry, but all I did was gently scold her for not telling me, but that I’m glad she’s okay and that she had a good time with her girlfriend. I’m very new to this whole thing with my daughter, as I thought she was interested in men, but I’m willing to support her because I love her. 

The problem now is that she told me earlier this week that she intends to move within the next year and a half. She says it may be sooner rather than later because things are changing with her girlfriend’s living situation and she wanted to give me a heads up. I told her absolutely not, that she can’t move in with someone she’s only been dating for a couple of months, especially not when she’s moving several states away. All of her family is HERE, including me and her father and her brother, and her three living grandparents. I told her she’s too young and she can’t move that far away from us just for a girl. She told me that regardless of her girlfriend, she’s been wanting to move far away for years and that her girlfriend’s state was on a list of potential places. She said she loved being there when she visited and can’t wait to go back. She says I’m being unreasonable by asking her to stay and that she hates it here and feels like she “can’t be herself”.

Am I being the a-hole here? I don’t think she’s old enough or mature enough to leave.

Edit because someone asked- my daughter didn’t ask for money. She almost never asks for money, she’s like her father in that way. She’s almost completely financially independent. I have her on my health/dental insurance to help her out, my mother pays her monthly phone plan because she insisted on doing something for my daughter, and my daughters grandfather on her father’s side pays her car insurance, and my daughter goes to her father when she has car troubles because he has a lot of experience with cars. My daughter takes care of all her other needs on her own.

Edit- my child’s father is NOT my husband. We never married. We have not been together since she was born. I would have left him earlier had I not become pregnant. I regret being involved with him because he is why I was introduced and became addicted to drugs. I do not regret my daughter. Please stop calling me a homophobe. I support my daughter. I am just apparently ignorant to some things about being gay.

Edit- I am no longer talking about or answering questions about my addiction. Most of you are making baseless assumptions and disgusting accusations and I won’t entertain them. I tried my best to be a good mother and get clean. That’s that. I may not have been the best person to have custody of her as a child, but neither was her actively abusive father who stalked, abused, manipulated, and intimidated me the entire time I’ve known him.

Edit 3/24- I can’t keep up with the comments. I’ve also been banned from commenting because I apparently broke a rule. I’m going to try to talk to my daughter about all of this when I see her this weekend. I want to be a part of her life even if I think she’s moving in the wrong direction.",Asshole
"AITA for telling my younger sister to either tidy up her messy hair, or she won't be allowed to attend our grandfather's funeral?","A little while back, our beloved grandfather passed away. He lived a very long and happy life (he was 98 years old!) so rather than having a mournful funeral, my parents wanted the event to be more of a celebration of grandpa's life.

I (24M) was at my parents’ house for the weekend, in order to attend our grandfather’s funeral. I and my parents were all ready and waiting for my 14-year old sister, Christina (we usually just call her “Chris”) to hurry up. Chris used to be a sweet person, but nowadays she fancies herself a cool rebel. In reality, she’s a bit of a brat.

Chris came downstairs, and her hair was unacceptably messy. Actually, her hair is always long and messy. However, our mother and grandmother insist that her untidy hair makes her look “cute” and so Chris just keeps it this way.

I know it sounds weird, but I felt like the least my little sister could do was to straighten her hair out and look more formal and respectful. I wasn’t in the mood to deal with her usual bullshit that day, so I bluntly told her to tidy up her hair or don’t come to the funeral. My sister responded by swearing at me, and I got into a short, but vicious verbal fight with her. In the end, Chris was crying and she was furious at me, as were both of my parents. We all arrived at the funeral somewhat late, and Christina was the only one in our family who was crying during the funeral.

ETA: Some people here suggest that Chris's hair is naturally curly. But that's not the case. It's naturally plain and straight. But the way my sister does things, her hair is just kind of all over the place, like a rock musician kinda look. IMO, NOT an appropriate aesthetic for a funeral.",Asshole
AITA for wanting an apology from my boyfriend and more after he made my family seem like drunks to his parents?,"22F my boyfriend came by our family party for Easter yesterday. We are your stereotypical large irish family that does enjoy drinking when we get together. Nobody gets sloshed but people are anticipating a pretty good time when we all get together. 

My bf’s family is almost the opposite. There’s rarely alcohol at his family events and if there is it’s usually like a glass of wine that someone may have and that’s it. It doesn’t matter to me. I can have fun drinking and not drinking. 

I was with my bf after the party and he was on the phone with his mom in front of me. She must have asked him about the party because he was describing it. The things he was saying really embarrassed me and I thought made us look like drunks. 

Some quotes were: 
“Yeah mom it was wild. Like 10 minutes after we get back from church Oh here comes aunt Suzy with a tray of whiskey shots for everyone’s”
“I was asked by 3 different cousins to shotgun a beer” 
“It literally felt like I was at a college party but with drunk old people and little kids running around”

He was laughing it off and hung up the phone with his mom. I’m not sure if he knew I heard the convo but I just told him how bad that made me feel. I told him he painted my whole family as alcoholics and now his parents probably think less of me. He assured me that’s not the case and his parents aren’t judgmental. I have met them, and while they’re nice, I’m sure they will gossip about this. 

I still think he was wrong. I told him that I want an apology, and I want to hear him call his mom back and tell him he was exaggerating and that wasn’t true (even though what he said was true about the shots and the beer) aita for wanting this

AITA for insisting my SIL to visit us more when she is a busy resident doctor and she says she can't?,"My SIL (married to my brother) is a resident physician who works 60-80hr weeks and frequently works 1 or both days of the weekend. Her residency is a 7hr drive from where me, my husband and my baby girl (1.5yr old).

My brother and I were always very close growing up and even lived in the same apartment and later same city. We were never more than 20-30m away from each other. I got married and had my baby and he moved 7hrs away to be with his fiance, now wife, pretty soon after I had my baby. It was devastating for me as I had always pictured us being close and him really involved as an uncle. SIL works 6am-5:30pm 6-7 days a week but does have some ""golden weekends"" where she has Saturday and Sunday off. She usually has one per month and then she has 3 weeks of vacation (never over Christmas or New Years holidays).

During those 1 weekend a month that she has completely off, her and my brother either stay at home because she needs to relax or will drive 2hrs to see her family. During the 3 weeks of vacation, which she is only able to take 1 week at a time, they went on a 1 week long trip to Hawaii, a 1 week long trip to Cancun with her family and then 1 week where they just visited her family 2 hrs away. They haven't made the trip to visit us more than 1-2x a year as they say the drive is too hard with the limited time off she has and she's usually too tired to come anyways. But not too tired for Hawaii or Cancun?

They always ask my parents and us to visit them during holidays she works so at least we can be together and she will join everyday after 5. But, it's hard for us to travel with a 1.5 year old. My parents have to split time visiting there and visiting us and we need them for childcare. I've been asking my brother and SIL to visit us more even though I know her schedule is busy and my brother got frustrated with me. When I asked him to visit alone, he said she needs him because the heavy workload has been really mentally straining on her and quoted how resident physicians have a really high depression rate and basically called me TA.

AITA for asking my girlfriend to watch my favorite movies with me?,"Throwaway because.

Last weekend was my (M28) birthday. My girlfriend (F25) had asked what I wanted to do and I said I wanted to watch my favorite movie trilogy, LOTR. I don't think my girlfriend was thrilled but she didn't say anything and agreed. She has seen them before and I don't think she really likes them very much but she knows I love them so she doesn't really say anything besides they aren't really her thing. 

But I really wanted to make a day of watching them and I went over to her house because she has a really big comfortable couch.  About ten minutes into the first movie and I look over and she is browsing on her phone. I was a little miffed but didn't say anything. She basically scrolled through her phone the entire movie. When we started the second movie, she opened a bottle of wine and proceeded to drink the whole thing, while still sitting on her phone. I was pretty irritated at this point because she wasn't even paying attention at all. 

The third movie started and by then she had opened another bottle of wine and was asleep within the first twenty minutes. I was really mad at that point and just left and went home. 

A few hours later I got a text asking where I went. I told her I was mad that she couldn't pay attention to my favorite movies on my birthday. She told me I was an asshole and to grow the hell up. I've texted her a couple times but she hasn't responded. AITA?

Edit: This has really blown up and I've gotten a little overwhelmed, but I do accept that I was the asshole. Watching 9 hours of movies that she hates was definitely too much of an ask and I shouldn't have reacted the way I did. I just took it personally because I felt like she didn't even try and these movies are important to me. The fact that she isn't much of a drinker and drank this much kind of set me off.

"AITA for ""using weaponized incompetence"" when getting gifts for my girlfriend?","I have never been the best at gift giving. It's something I can't seem to master the art of. I don't know if I'm just not as thoughtful as everyone else or what. I've had maybe one or two moments of spotting something and going 'this reminds me of \[insert person here\], let me buy it.' Other than that, I'm pretty much phoning it in with gift cards. Whenever a holiday or special event approaches, it's like my mind goes blank to what the person would like.

My best friend's birthday was this weekend and I truly felt like I had a stroke of genius leading up to it. He's a history buff and spends most of his time studying and traveling. He's also spent the last year of his life writing a dissertation that he hopes to turn into a book. I've read over the draft versions of it as he works (sometimes out of curiosity, mostly to help out with proofreading as a fresh set of eyes), but it's now very near completion. I requested another copy of manuscript, had two copies properly bound, and wrote up an ""about the author"" section myself to include.

When I presented them to him at his birthday party, I told him the first was for him to keep as his very first copy, and the second was a copy for me - the very first autographed one, if he would be so kind as to sign it. The whole thing was a really nice moment for us, and his family who I'm very close with. When he read over what I had written about him in the 'about the author' section, he teared up a little. This is one of the only times making someone cry has ever made me feel so good.

My girlfriend was there during this whole display and didn't say much. She went home early while I stayed the night with my friend. When we talked the next day, she told me the gift thing was overkill and it was proof that I was using ""weaponized incompetence"" previously in order to get out of putting time and thought into gifts for her. 

I'm kind of at a loss here. I didn't think the nice gesture was indicative of anything other than me doing something kind. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for screaming at a child and making him cry?,"I (m21) went to eat with some friends from college to a restaurant that's near the campus. The place is not the nicest, but it's better food than McDonald's and we use to go there when we want to have a ""semi special occasion"". This time the occasion was that the four of our had passed our exams. 

It was lunch time, the place was not completely full, but full enough. We had bad weather so we stayed inside (everyone did). Most people were adults. 

Then two women (an older one and a middle aged one) came with a baby and a kid around 7/10 years old. I was sitting facing the door so I saw them walk in but I didn't think any of it, I'm not someone easily annoyed by kids most times. They took a table in a corner. Our table was around the middle of the room.

We were waiting for our food and chatting. The kid was playing with the baby and they were making a bit of noise, but then again we all were making noise as most of us were accompanied and chatting. 

After our food came in though, the kid started to wander around. He wanted to read a sign near the door, then one near the back. After that he wanted to go to bathroom, then he wanted to go outside, etc. It was kinda annoying, but quite easy to just ignore. Should I say that neither of the women that were with him did nothing to stop him, not at any time. 

At some point, the kid started to run around while yelling, he was playing to something by himself. He went on and on, and neither of the women did something. Other people were looking annoyed too. He even accidentally hit my friend's chair. As we were in the middle table, he started running circles around us. By the third time he tried passing next to me I put my arm out to stop him. I told him to stop that and to go sit down and wait until he's home to run around because it's inappropriate to bother other people at a public space. I also told him I'll have him wait outside alone if he doesn't behaves (which I was obviously not gonna do because I can't basically, it was just to scare him off). I honestly don't know how it came out, in my mind I was quite calm but apparently I was screaming at the kid. 

The kid started to cry and then (I assume) his mom came in and told me off for telling at him and how he's just a kid and was playing and such. I told her I wouldn't have had to do anything if she would have told the kid to stay quiet before. 

Some guy from the staff came in and asked what happened. She told him I had yelled at the kid, I told him that yeah I did but calmly explained why I did it. He said that we should just let this go for once and that next time the staff will manage the situation before anything happens. The woman was fuming so they left. 

My friends told me I did in fact screamed at the kid but they were annoyed too and said they were about to complain with management over this kid. I honestly think that would've been the best idea and now I think that I took the wrong turn here.",Asshole
AITA for telling my sister that her baby isn’t the only one that matters?,"I (32M) am expecting my second child with my (30F) wife. My wife is 14 weeks pregnant, and we are really excited! My sister (25F) and her wife (27F) are also pregnant with their first child. My sister and her wife did IVF, and my sister is 38 weeks pregnant. I’m very happy for them, and I think they will make great parents. 

The other day we all met up to see our grandparents. They live out of state and don’t visit a lot, so when they do we always set aside time to see them all together. My grandparents were talking about how excited they were to see my sister and her wife become mothers, and they couldn’t wait to have their first great granddaughter. They continued to talk about my sister’s baby and didn’t even acknowledge my wife’s pregnancy. I could tell it was hurting my wife, so I tried to start a conversation to include her but it always went back to my sister and my SIL’s baby. I even tried talking about the gender reveal we are holding soon, but no one seemed to care. My wife got upset and walked out of the room. My sister asked me if everything was okay, and I told her that my wife was upset because she’s feeling left out. My SIL apologized and said that that wasn’t her intention. My mom tried to convince my wife to come back and sit down, but she refused. My sister told me that my wife cant expect every conversation to be about her, and “this isn’t a competition.” I told my sister that her baby isn’t the only baby that matters and ours matters too. My grandma told me that she would be more than happy to discuss both pregnancies, but it was too late. My wife wanted to leave, so that’s what we did. 

I’m now being called an asshole by my parents for making a scene with my grandparents there. I feel like no one cares enough to see my wife and I’s side in this.

AITA for not reimbursing my nanny for books she bought for my daughter?,"
My daughter, Ruby, is 12. Recently, she has gotten into the original Star Trek show, as well as the Next Generation. Ruby is also a big reader and has started to collect a few of the old Star Trek books that she finds in used bookstores and thrift stores. These books usually cost anywhere from 50 cents to a couple of dollars. 

My nanny, Tessa (f22), hangs out with Ruby most days after she gets out of school. Tessa has been our nanny for over a year now and she and Ruby get along great. Tessa is big into to thrifting and will often keep an eye out for the books Ruby wants. This is not typically a problem and Ruby always pays Tessa back for the books using her allowance.

The problem occurred when Tessa went on a family vacation out west. Apparently she went thrifting during this trip and found some books for Ruby. She texted Ruby asking her if she wanted the books and Ruby said yes. 

Well Tessa returned yesterday with a stack of about 35 books and told Ruby they cost $50. Ruby doesn't have this much money and told Tessa. Tessa then asked me if I would cover the cost. I said no as Tessa had never asked me about buying Ruby the books, nor was I aware of the conversation between the two of them. Tessa got upset and I asked Ruby to show me the text which made no mention of price, or even the amount of books she was buying. Tessa only said that she found ""some"" books for Ruby. Ruby is on the autism spectrum and does not read between the lines. You have to be very literal with her. 

Previously, Tessa has never bought Ruby more than one or two books at a time, so I told her that she should have clarified with Ruby regarding the amount, or double checked with me before purchasing, and that I would not be paying the $50. Tessa said she could not return the books because they came from the thrift store. I stood firm in my decision and reiterated that she should have asked me first. 

Tessa left and Ruby is very upset. I know Tessa is a student and does not have a ton of money so am I the asshole for not paying Tessa for the books?

EDIT: Because some people are asking- I am a single parent to Ruby and while $50 dollars will not make or break the bank, it is definitely an unexpected expense. I provide Tessa with an extra amount of money each month to spend on whatever she wants to do with Ruby (movies, the mall, etc). If she wanted to spend this fund on books for Ruby, that would have been totally fine- but she had already used it up.

EDIT 2: I definitely didn't expect this post to blow up overnight, so I'm going to add a bit more context. For those of you who are asking how I can afford a nanny for Ruby and still have $50 be a large unexpected expense- I do not pay for Tessa's services. Because Ruby is on the spectrum, she is entitled to benefits from our state, including care. The agency I work with pays Tessa. I am not involved in that process at all.

UPDATE: I appreciate everyone's valuable insights into the situation. I have seen a few comments hinting to me about the fact that I don't support my daughter's reading habit. Please know this is DEFINITELY not the case. We are both big readers and frequent patrons of our local library. I am always supportive of Ruby getting new books. 

I talked to Tessa and told her that I appreciate her for thinking of Ruby, apologized for the misunderstanding, and have paid her for the books. We had a chat about expectations in the future and I don't think this will happen again. I have also talked to Ruby and we agreed that I would hold onto the books and she would pay me for them as she wishes. It's important to me that Ruby learns how to handle her finances appropriately, and we have decided that she will get two new books every week (she reads very quickly). 
After reading through your perspectives on the matter, I agree that it is better in the long run to lose the money and salvage the relationship between the three of us, and had not considered all the implications of doing otherwise. Lesson learned!",Asshole
AITA for making a fuss about my plane seat?,"I (18m) was travelling to my home country. On my second connecting flight, which is also by far my longest one being over 12 hours long, I had the delightful sight of an obese man that was taking up a good chunk of my seat.

I am not a small guy myself. I have quite broad shoulders and am around 190 cm, so a full seat would already have been uncomfortable. I told the flight attendant about this issue and she told me that the seat was paid for by this obese person and the flight was full.

I asked the flight attendant how it’s possible that my seat still rendered as available if it was being used for someone’s literal rolls, as this wasn’t an american airline (non-american airlines don’t get overbooked).

I then added on how this airline wasn’t absolutely terrible just a few years ago (it wasn’t just this incident they just went downhill in quality).

These comments prompted the flight attendant to call me rude and just made her double down on me getting kicked off the plane, though she reassured me I’d be compensated for this trouble as I told her I wasn’t travelling for vacation.

The fat man took his opportunity to call me a fatphobic shit. Some other people around gave me the stink eye. I know they think I’m a bad person for this, but on the other hand I’m having to pay for the lack of discipline of another person as well as this shitty airline’s booking system. Hell I’d rather they called me the day before.

The airline staff sent a letter of complaint that I got appealed and the consequences in the complaint (being a temporary ban) were removed less than an hour later. In the letter of complaint it said I was being rude to other passengers and the staff.

Since it got appealed so quick, and I got to travel the next day anyway, I’m really not sure if I’m TA.

AITA for making my daughter go somewhere with a girl she’s not friends with?,"My  (38F) daughter, Melody is 10 years old. She goes to an after school program which is where she met, Leah (also 10). I know Leah’s mom, Daniella, somewhat well as we had older kids in class together a few years back. 

Melody has told me several times that Leah is too loud, doesn’t understand personal space, asks rude questions, etc. I’ve told her they don’t have to be friends, but to still be polite. Daniella later confided in me that Leah is on the spectrum, which I already suspected.

Recently, the kids had a day off. Daniella called and asked if Melody wanted to go to the aquarium with her and Leah. I said sure. When I hung up and told Melody, she got upset and said she didn’t want to go. I said I already told Daniella she’d go and it’d be fun. I pointed out that Leah doesn’t have a ton of friends and maybe if more people took the time to know her, they’d realize she’s nice. Melody grumbled but finally agreed. 

About a half hour after they left, I get a call from my SIL. Turns out she had taken her son to the aquarium and was leaving as Melody, Leah and Daniella walked in. Melody instantly said she wanted to leave with her aunt. My SIL didn’t want to just take her. I was super embarrassed, feeling bad for Leah. I asked to speak to Melody, telling SIL to take her aside and out of earshot. I told Melody she was being extremely rude. I asked her how poor Leah felt after she went with her and instantly wanted to leave. Melody kept saying she didn’t want to be there and started whining. I finally told SIL to bring her home. As rude as I found this, I realized it’d be even worse for Daniella and Leah to deal with my grumpy, whiny child.

SIL dropped Melody off. I told my daughter she was very rude and it wouldn’t have killed her to spend one afternoon doing something nice for someone. Melody said she doesn’t want to be Leah’s friend and went to her room. I called Daniella to apologize. She was gracious, but did admit Leah cried and they ended up leaving early because she wasn’t having fun. She assured me that she hadn’t paid yet for my daughter before this incident so at least no money was wasted. I did venmo her money for their passes as I felt bad they were unable to enjoy it due to Melody. 

When my husband found out, te flipped out on me. Telling me I violated our child’s autonomy and that it’s my fault all this happened. I felt this was an extreme overreaction. Especially when he basically coddled Melody and took her to dinner just them.

AITA for letting my girlfriend do most of the household chores because she doesn’t pay as much of the rent as I do?,"I (24M) work for a very prominent company and get paid a lot better than my girlfriend (23F). We both moved to a different state for my job, and she ended up with a very toxic work environment with a boss who was sexist and homophobic. She hated her job and ended up getting a new one that pays a lot less than her old one, and has asked me to take on the responsibility of paying most of the rent. 

Since we have been in this new state, she has done most of the cleaning. I contribute by doing the dishes sometimes and washing the laundry (she folds it). She is the only one who cleans the bathroom, the kitchen, and the only one who sweeps, mops, and vacuums along with other random chores here and there. 

It’s been about 8 months since we moved and everything was fine until recently. The other day she asked me to vacuum the living room and I said I didn’t know where the vacuum was. Since then, she keeps bringing up how I need to do more of the housework, but I feel like because I contribute more to the rent she should be responsible for keeping the apartment clean. I also do the dishes sometimes and do stuff she asks me to do. 

I’ve done more of the dishes since she brought it up (doing them maybe once a week instead of once every other week). She now leaves cleaning tasks for me to do without telling me about them and then gets upset when they aren’t done. If she just asked me to clean those parts of the apartment then I would. She claims that I should know what needs to get done and just do them myself without making her bring it up first. Eventually she gets frustrated and just cleans by herself.

I’m also tired from working when I get home and I just want to relax or finish my work. She works the same amount of hours as me, but her job is much less demanding than mine so she is less drained by the end of the day. She does pay for our groceries and my gas sometimes as well as other little things here and there. 

I don’t think I’m an asshole for expecting her to contribute with the housework since I contribute more financially. AITA for letting her do most of cleaning since I pay for most of the rent?

Edit: I just want to answer some of the more common questions I’ve been seeing. We both work the same amount of hours each week. She has agreed that her job is less demanding than mine. We split the rent 60/40 so I pay about 60% of it right now. Her health concerns aren’t an every day thing, but they come up a few times a month. I know where the vacuum is now. After receiving the comments I have, I really need to sit and reflect on how I am acting in this relationship. I recognize now that I have truly and deeply made a mistake with thinking paying more of the rent means that I should do less of the housework. I really love her and I value her so much, and I’ve clearly done a horrible job at showing that.

Update: I appreciate those of you defending me in the comments, but I’ve come to the conclusion that I am the asshole. Please don’t say anything negative about my girlfriend since she has not done anything wrong. She’s tried talking to me about this and I have not been receptive. I’m sorry for not responding to people, I was having a conversation with her. There’s nothing I can do to make up for the past 8 months, and I was an idiot to think that my financial contribution was great enough to warrant not doing any chores. I would do anything to keep her, and I messed up thinking that this was a small issue. I hope she forgives me for not taking her concerns seriously, and I hope I can create an environment where she feels comfortable confronting me in the future if I’m EVER acting like this again. It shouldn’t have come down to strangers on the internet telling me I’m an asshole to realize this, but thank you all for the wake up call so much. I am never going to dismiss her or all the hard work she puts into this relationship and our life together again. Im going to start doing the majority of the chores for the time being. I’m also going to start paying more of the rent since I do make more. I don’t pay more of the rent to have a housekeeper, I pay more of the rent because I love her and I want to support her. Thank you all again for the reality check.",Asshole
AITA for my girlfriend hating my white lies to others,"30M  with 28F GF. Shouldn't have had this conversation before date night...pretty much ruined. But she tells me that she is experiencing feelings of doubt in trusting things I said because I tell white lies. Nothing serious but little things. Like I lied to some hotel staff so she could go to the bathroom, or lied to the airplane hostess so I could get an extra soda. And she is like seeing those is damaging. ""Your best self is someone that doesn't lie"". I'm of the opinion that people lie when they are uncomfortable. Her best friend just lied to their other friend because she wasn't comfortable sharing her relationship drama yet. But she also said her best friend has a zero tolerance lie policy. to me that makes her friend a hypocrite and it makes my GF naive. People lie. Lies are tools. Just because I use that tool in certian situations doesn't mean you can't trust me. I know my parents have lied, my advisor lies, EVERYONE LIES when it suits them, it doesn't mean you have to spend every second doubting what people are saying. And I shared these things with her. She now thinks I don't care about her. I'm like it's ridiculous to promise I'd never lie about anything in life ever so she can trust me. That shit is unrealistic and naive.

AITA for refusing to help my daughter with her car payment because she is a stripper?,"I 47m have a 22 year old daughter. She’s in college and lives on campus. I agreed to help her make car payments, since she was in school. 

I was recently informed by a young man I work with that my daughter strips at a club about 40 minutes away. I confronted her on this and she said she  didn’t plan to do it after she graduated, and she needed some money. I told her then work at McDonalds, not use her body.

We got into an argument, and i asked her to quit stripping and get a decent job then. She refused and said stripping was easy money, so basically I said there was no need for me to pay her car payment anymore since she is making money so easily. She got upset and said that wasn’t fair, and that she doesn’t make enough for that. I told her to figure it out.

She told my wife about what happened, and my wife is upset by her job of choice but says it’s unfair for me to stop supporting her so suddenly over an argument. I think it’s perfectly fair, it’s my money and my decision when to cut it off.",Asshole
AITA for making my BF walk our dog at 3AM?,"**edit: the 1000 comments saying the exact same thing and the unhinged dm’s telling me to kill my dog can stop now because I already said 50 comments in that I was TA and that I’ll work harder on retraining her with the help of a trainer hopefully because there are some root issues that need working on first** 

I’m a nurse. I used to get home from work and our dog would be by the door waiting because she got used to the time I’d be home. I’d then take her for a quick walk. She got used to it and it turned to a habit. I was working night shifts only pretty consistently until now.

My boyfriend refuses to wake up at night when she comes barking at our door and acts likes he is dead asleep or just point blank says no. I then have to wake up and do it.

Yesterday night I went to the bathroom as soon because I genuinely needed it but then she woke up and wanted to go for her walk. I could her my bf calling me but I stayed in bathroom a while longer to prompt him to get up and take her on walk because I have told him time and time again it’s unfair that I always have to do it. 

He did end up doing it but was pretty pissed off about it and said I created this issue and should deal with it to fix it.

AITA for not emptying 2 of my daughter's rooms?,"My wife and I have 2 kids, M39 and F16. I also have a grandson M17.

We live in a 4 bedroom house. My wife and I share a room and the other 3 rooms are my daughter's rooms. One of them is her bedroom, one is her library(she is a bookworm and has a lot of book that wouldn't fit in her bedroom) and the last one is her painting room. She loves painting and is really good at it. Keep in mind that all of these rooms are small.

My son needs a place to stay for a few months or maybe a year and asked to move in with us.

My wife and I have been arguing about this a lot. My wife thinks we should pack everything in our daughter's library and painting room and put them in an storage somewhere so our son can move in.

I think this wouldn't be fair for my daughter. Painting and reading are her only hobbies and there is no other place at home to put them so she has to give up her hobbies for about a year.

My wife and son think I'm an asshole for ""trying to make them homeless""

Edit: I see everyone suggesting emptying one of the rooms. I'd agree with that and I think my daughter will agree with that too however they want both of the rooms.

AITA for keeping my daughter away from my sister in law?,"During the first four-ish years of my daughter's life my husband and I had many fights and struggles. At one point he was living with my daughter and his brother for almost two years and we nearly got divorced. My daughter bonded very strongly to his brother's wife. 

Covid opened my eyes and my husband and I have healed a lot and I am repairing my relationship with him and my daughter. I attend sobriety groups and parenting classes. I understand these things take time. However he continously brings my daughter to visit his brother and her wife. If you ask my daughter she'll say her favorite person is her aunt. My daughter can't help this but my sister in law certainly can. She is always calling my daughter ""my baby"", taking her on outings, etc. She will FaceTime my husband just to speak to my daughter. She seems to not want to relinquish the place she took in my daughter's life. 

A few weeks ago I took my daughter to get her ears pierced for her birthday. This was supposed to be a special moment for us, it was the same birthday my mom took me. But instead my daughter started panicking uncontrollably and wanting my sister in law. She didn't want to do if without my sister in law there. At this point I decided to put my foot down. I have been trying to decrease the visits and the FaceTimes. But now my husband is catching on. I try to explain my daughter needs to spend time with us as a family without outside influences, and she needs to bond with her mother without being confused. He says I am being selfish. I don't see how it's selfish to want to repair my relationship with my child. He says that is is unfair to my daughter, and I explained yes it is but he is making it a thousand times worse by not ripping off the band aid. 

I have worked so hard to get my family back, meanwhile my husband will not even give me an inch. It's frustrating that I am always made out to be the bad guy when all I want is to fix things.

AITA for telling a lady not to do hip thrusts at a bench?,"Yesterday I was at the gym, and I noticed this lady who was doing hip thrusts at a flat bench. This looked weird, but regardless I went up to her and asked how many sets she has, to which she said one. As a result, I decided to wait until she's done with her exercise.

For those of you that don't workout, a flat bench press at any gym is 90% of the time being used, and most of the time you'll have to wait in line. It looks extremely bad to do any other exercise that can be done at a different spot where people don't have to wait. However, I let the lady do her exercise.

She then tells me with attitude ""Why don't you do another exercise until I'm done"" to which I say ""I'll just wait until you're finished with your set"". She tells me I don't know gym etiquette and that I'm impatient, to which I respond with ""Maybe you shouldn't be doing hip thrusts at a flat bench if you don't want people constantly waiting"". She then reports me to the staff.

The staff essentially saw where I was coming from, but does note that people can do any exercise at any machine. I told her I was aware, which is why I waited until the lady was done. I'm asking AITA because two other people who overheard the conversation said I was rude.",Asshole
AITA for blowing up on my son's girlfriend?,"My husband thinks I'm in the right, but my niece helped me make this post on here to see what other people think.

I (52f) have three sons ages ranging from 13 to 20. My oldest son (20m) has a girlfriend (19f) that hands around our house a lot... It's a really small house and doesn't have a lot of space. She's a nice girl but gets on my nerves sometimes because she's always over. I really don't think she's right for my son, either. Our tapwater has a weird aftertaste so I order gallon water bottles and use them to refill a big glass bowl with a tap.

It is not cheap to get water and other groceries delivered, so I tell my sons, husband, and the girlfriend to be courteous of the other people who live here and not use up the water, as it runs out fast in our big household.

Yesterday, I caught her filling up her big metal water bottle with the jug water, and I calmly told her that other people live here, too, and she shouldn't hog the water all to herself. She was rather short with me and said something along the lines of: ""Actually, this water bottle is big enough to hold all the water someone should be drinking in a day. I'm not hogging water, I'm just trying to stay hydrated.""

I found her tone to be disrespectful and ordered her to leave. She scoffed and went back to my son's room. That's when I really got frustrated. I opened their door and told her she has to leave. My son got really angry with me and told me that my girlfriend didn't do anything wrong and why is it a crime for her to drink water? I explained that I order this water for our family to use, not leeches who hang around all day rent-free. My son's girlfriend got a little teary eyed and left the room and out the front door without saying anything.

My son told me that I was a major asshole and should have just minded my business. I think she's just wasteful and a brat. AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for all the comments. I have spoken to my son about the issue, and you all made me realize that it was deeper than just the water. I showed him this post and explained that it's not her, it's me. I think she reacted that way when I initially told her off for filling up the bottle because--and my son helped me realize this, too--I was never really nice to her to begin with, in the course of their three year relationship (in my defense, she only started hanging around our house a lot about six months ago because she got a license). 

We called her on the phone this morning and I apologized for my reaction to the bottle. I explained I didn't mean to make her feel bad about the water--it really wasn't that big of a deal, and I feel silly for making it a big deal. She apologized for having an attitude and explained how she can feel a little defensive around me sometimes. I told her and my son that I will work on my attitude. My husband still thinks she was being disrespectful but I explained that I'm the reason she felt the need to act that way in the first place. It's not my choice who my son decided to date and I need to respect his choice. I think she is a sweet girl, and I feel horrible for the way I have been treating her. Again, thank you to everyone for making me realize my mistake.

PS: I have looked into purchasing a Brita pitcher to see if that is more cost effective. My son's girlfriend now brings water from home--although I didn't tell her to do that.",Asshole
AITA for playing a bit of a prank on a new veterinary assistant?,"I work at a sort of combination veterinary / wildlife rehab center, and  we hired a new assistant last week.

On her second day we had a dog come in whose anal glands we had to express, one of the least pleasant parts of the job. I trained her on how to do it, and also said ""also it's important to hold your face right behind so you can see what you're doing better,"" mimicking the posture

(Not true of course, no one does that - it can spray further than people think!)

So she gave it a try and got the hang of it real fast...and got sprayed in the face with the anal gland secretions moreso than I expected.

I laughed and was about to offer her a towel to clean off and say ""welcome to the gross world of this profession"" or something but she took it worse than I thought, gagging a lot and then running out of the room to the toilet right across the hall and, from the sounds of it, throwing up.

She was very mad and stormed out afterwards. Apparently she reported me and my manager and even coworkers all seem to be on her side about how horrible it is. I got 2 days of unpaid leave and apparently there was talk of me having to help with skunk rehab without protective gear on for a couple days, if I want to keep working there at all (which seems totally disproportionate, that's not at all the same and won't wash off)

I didn't think it was that bad of a prank because these sorts of gross incidents are a part of the job and you have to get used to gross things, I could see how it was a bit rough for a second day though but is it really the monstrous act that she seemed to think it was?

We have the boys play with her so she's getting active, and we make a distinction between foods that are healthy and ones that aren't. When I see one of the kids reaching for a ""treat"" food in the pantry I'll ask ""would you like to make a healthier choice?"" And Gwen is really getting it, she's always going for better choices now and is also asking for fruit at home which is really good.

Gwen's birthday ended up falling on one of her weekends with us, and while we were talking about what kind of cake to have, I asked Gwen about the healthier choice. My reasoning is unfortunately she's still getting all that garbage at home, and it's just not good for a growing girl. She agreed and we decided to have some low fat ice cream so she can still have a sweet treat. It's a brand Gwen loves and asks for every time she's here, so she was happy with it.

Until the next day after she went back to mom. Her mom called us furious, she said then when Gwen got home and she asked about her birthday with us and her cake, Gwen started crying because she really did want cake but didn't want to ""make a bad choice"". She accused me of fat shaming her and her daughter and that I owe her a cake and a big apology.

I'm just looking out for the health of a child in my care, but I never said Gwen couldn't have cake and she could have had one if she said she wanted one. I suggested sticking to ice cream because I care. But did I go about it in a TA way?",Asshole
AITA for making fun of my brother and joking about his “manhood”,"I (m36) have an older brother “M” (38). He has twin daughters (13). He is a single dad, his wife (the twins mom) passed away 5 years ago. 

M is a very involved dad which I think is great. For the twin’s birthday, he surprised them with Taylor swift eras tour tickets. They went to the show last night. Of course because the twins are still young M went with them. Of course the girls were really excited so they took a lot of pictures and videos. M shared some of the pictures. I jokingly commented damn M looks like someone took your man card last night lol. Suddenly my phone blows up with texts from M calling me the biggest AH and told me I need to learn to grow up.

AITA for expecting my boyfriends parents to treat my daughter the same as his daughters?,"I (37F) have been dating Martin (39) for what will be 2 years this June. I have a daughter, Scarlett (10) and he has 2 daughters: Miley (13) and Joanna (12). I am a single mother to Scarlett. Her father sends me maintenance each month but has never been an active parent and has never met Scarlett. I also grew up in care so I have no family or anything. Whereas Martin is divorced and shares custody with his ex-wife. Their custody agreement is very flexible with the girls sometimes staying with him or their mum longer or often spending times with both parents together. It really bothered me a lot that he was still good friends with his ex-wife and Martin said if I couldn’t handle the fact he could coparent well and be amicable with his ex then he would end things. I like to think I got over my jealousy and that the girls mother and I get on. 

Anyway since we’ve been dating a while and have started discussing potentially living together I think it’s only really fair that Scarlett is more involved and treated the same as Martin’s daughters by his parents. She met them for the first time a few months ago and has since seen them a few times since but she’s treated virtually like a stranger. At Christmas, Miley and Joanna were spoilt rotten. They got money, gifts, toys, gift vouchers and makeup. All they got Scarlett was an embroidered blanket thing Martin’s mother spent weeks knitting apparently with her name on it, two gift vouchers and a doll.

They’ll take Martin’s girls for overnight sleepovers but my kid is excluded. They say because they don’t know her that well and are uncomfortable looking after her for now. They’ll buy Joanna and Miley sweets or little trinkets and give them a couple of pounds here and there every so often but as for Scarlett, they might only give her one thing and that’s it. It’s not fair for Scarlett.

The last straw was when his parents asked if we would all like to go to Disneyland Paris in Easter with them. They offered to pay for Martin, the girls and said that they could pay for part of mine and Scarlett’s travel expenses, but that I’d have to pay the rest.  

I lost it and told Martin he needs to tell his parents to treat Scarlett like his girls are treated. It’s not fair to her that she has to watch her sisters being spoilt and she isn’t. He lashed out in return and said my parents have been nothing but accommodating to Scarlett by including her in things and getting her stuff at Christmas and so on. He said I’m incredibly selfish to expect his parents to treat my daughter who they barley know as the same as their grandchildren. He said that I’m bitter and jealous and it’s not like we’re married or living together. He used the example of the blanket being a really sweet gift that shows how much his mother cares. He also said it’s perfectly reasonable for his parents to expect me to pay for my own child to go to Disney and that my parents don’t need to pay anything at all for us. He also said I’m raising my daughter to not learn the value of the word no and that she can just be expected to get whatever he wants. He also said that Joanna and Miley are not Scarlett’s sisters, it’s never been emphasised they were and they do not view Scarlett as that. He said that I need to ‘get your arse in gear and realise nothing is being done to discriminate against or exclude Scarlett.’

AITA?

ETA: I view Joanna and Miley as bonus daughters, hence why Scarlett calls them her sisters. Joanna and Miley do not view me as a mother figure in anyway, only as ‘dad’s girlfriend.’ It really hurts but i don’t think im pushy or anything. I just think of us as a blended family unit whereas Joanna and Miley have said im just the woman their dad is dating and Scarlett is nothing to them family wise. I have tried to get them to involve her whenever they’re doing stuff and they outright refuse so they only as they put it ‘tolerate her.’ Martin has chewed me out about this before, claiming I’m trying to insert my daughter in the friendship groups and activities of his daughters and it greatly upsets Scarlett because she just wants to be included. She doesn’t have a lot of friends and I want Joanna and Miley to be her friends.

I have no family and Scarlett’s fathers family aren’t involved. I’ve always tried my best to spoil her myself but it seems only fair since we’re part of Martin’s family now that she’s treated the same as Joanna and Miley.",Asshole
AITA for not wanting to change my first dance song because of my step sister's association with it?,"Pretty much what the title says so I'm going to keep it quick,

We've chosen our first dance song. My step sister is not at all happy because she and her ex husband also had this at their wedding, and she said she has a lot of memories with this particular song. She asked if I could change it, I told her I get it but this is what we want, and I don't want to change it. She said she understood but she's been acting different around me and I could tell she was mad/upset.

Most people who know about this don't think I'm doing anything wrong, but I had my sister and one of my friends tell me I'm being selfish and not understanding here.

Some people are asking to edit in my comments so here they are:

*Yes. A few months after they got married he was in a wreck, he thankfully survived but has a very severe TBI (among other things). He lives in a specialized nursing home. They did get divorced but my sister still goes on about how she loves him and visits him occasionally. He doesn't remember who she is most of the time but my sister said she apparently sang this song to him and he ""looks like he remembers her"" (her words)* 

*Come What May (from the movie Moulin Rouge). My sister sees it as ""their"" song, she and her ex first met at the movies when they both went to watch it. Then apparently the restaurant they went to for their first date was also playing it, so they took it as a sign. And as I said, they also played it at their wedding. She also sings it to him sometimes now.*

*I think it's a really nice song and I'd like to play it too, I don't want to have to change it*",Asshole
AITA for telling my sister that our parents don’t have to agree with her relationship?,"
My (21F) sister isn’t accepted by my (29M) parents for being gay.

Throw away account so my family cant link this back to me. 

*For some context: My little sister is a lesbian. Our family does not support her decisions, but I don’t give a f*ck who she sleeps with. When she came out she was distanced from the family, but we started talking again after finding out our father is dying.*

After things in the family being rocky for a long time we decided to all get together at my parents house. My dad said he wanted to put all of the drama and bickering aside, and if we have a problem with each other we can wait until he passes. Everyone agrees, including my sister, so I was expecting to have a nice family BBQ. My family wanted to meet my sister’s girlfriend, and insisted that she brought her over. We were all excited to meet her. 

 My sister’s girlfriend seemed like a nice girl, but she was very stand off-ish. She kept to herself, and didn’t speak much to my parents and me. For the most part she was glued to my sister. This caused some awkward silence. I started asking about their relationship. How did they meet, how long have they been together, and I even joked around about if she hurt my sister *blah blah blah.* My parents started acting stranger by each question. I asked my mom what was wrong, and her response was:

“This isn’t right.” 

I could tell my sister and her girlfriend were uncomfortable, and my dad tried to calm my mom down. My sister, probably fed up with being treated like sh*t for the last few years, spoke up and asked my parents what was the point of inviting them if she wasn’t going to be okay with seeing them together. 

This caused my mother to explode with anger because she felt like my sister was being disrespectful. My mother goes onto say a lot of other things (that I’m not going to say because I will be banned 😅). My sister started to cry and hyperventilate. Her girlfriend starts to comfort her and tries to get her to calm down, and this causes my mom to tell her that “if you’re going to be dramatic and act like a child, you need to leave. You’re upsetting your father.” Before my sister could respond her girlfriend is grabbing their things and taking my sister to the car. 

I tried to rationalize this whole situation with my parents, they were no use. They thought she was putting on a show in front of her girlfriend to make them look bad. They proceeded to say that they’re allowed to be uncomfortable, and feel differently than her. I explained to them that this is who she loves. No one has to agree with it, but we should still love her. I’ve tried talking to my sister about the whole situation, and apparently I *defend our parents too much.* I told her that our parents don’t *have* to agree with her relationship, but they should. She told me that I’m being an asshole for expecting her to pretend it’s be someone else just because our dad is dying.

AITA for telling my daughter she was being a brat after she cried about blowing out her birthday candles?,"I have 4 kids, 23, 20, 16 and 13. This concerns my oldest, I'll refer to her as 'Zara'

We don't normally do big parties in our family after double digits (and 18th/21st), but Zara has been going through a bit of a difficult time so we decided to throw her a surprise party. This was yesterday.

It was a big family party and Zara was enjoying it. Then the cake was brought out, I have a lot of young nieces and nephews so naturally they wanted to stand up with Zara, and she had no issue. When she went to blow out the candles, my 5 year old niece blew most of them out before her.

Everyone laughed it off, my youngest actually put 23 candles on the cake and there were still a few lit, so I told Zara to blow those out. She did, but she looked angry and started crying. She then walked off.

After that it got quite awkward and my sister (niece's mom) got upset/embarrassed, that her daughter is a kid and didn't mean to do it, and she didn't think Zara would act like this. We all calmed her down that it's not their fault.

I talked to Zara and told her she was being a selfish brat and making a scene, she's 23 getting mad about birthday candles.

She was still upset, and my other kids are telling me I wasn't being fair with Zara.",Asshole
AITA for not wanting to work around my girlfriend's daughter's nap schedule?,"My girlfriend has an 8 year old daughter with a heart condition. I have a 7 year old daughter and 10 year old son.

My girlfriend's daughter has very specific needs that can be hard to work around. She can only be with one babysitter so if we want to go out without the kids, we have to go on the babysitter's schedule. If we do want to bring the kids we have to be at her house by 7 so her daughter can be in bed by 8. Day trips are nearly impossible because she takes a 2-3 hour nap at 12 so we either have to be driving for those 2-3 hours, we have to leave after she wakes up, or we have to get a hotel/motel/air bnb for her to take a nap (yes, we've actually done this before). Then there's all of the hospital stays to work around too. She stays in the hospital for 2 nights every 14 days. I only have 50/50 custody of my kids so it's very hard to get the kids together because of all of this. Sure we can go to build a bear, the indoor playground down the street from her house, or out for ice cream but you can only do that so many times before the kids get bored of it.

I've been trying to plan a weekend trip to an amusement park for so long but she wants to make us all work around her daughter's nap schedule. The amusement park doesn't open until 10 but we'd have to leave at 11:30 so she could go back to the hotel for her daughter to take a nap. We could go after she wakes up, so we'd probably get in at around 3:30 but the water rides close at 5 so my kids would only get to ride one, maybe 2 water rides then another couple regular rides before we'd have to go back for her daughter to go to bed.

She wants to do something that would be more accessible to her daughter (she can't go on the bigger rides or water slides and her having to take a nap would take a lot of time from the rides and games) like the beach and rent a place where we can do things in the house instead of having to go out all the time but my kids really want to do the amusement park trip. I eventually told her we're going to do the amusement park, she and her daughter are welcome to join but we won't be leaving early for naps or an early bedtime.

She says I'm dismissing her daughter's needs but I think she's refusing to take anyone else's needs into account.

Edit: My girlfriend just texted me that since I'm ""unwilling to compromise and find an accessible activity that everyone would enjoy"", she booked a last minute 7 day cruise for herself and her daughter so the kids and I can do whatever the fuck we want but she won't have any part in it. ",Asshole
AITA for not sleeping in the bed with my wife and dog?,"I (34M) travel a lot for work, often two to three weeks at a time. My children are of school age so my wife (35) has recently gotten a cocker spaniel dog to keep her company while everyone is away during the day. 

I’m pretty indifferent about dogs, don’t love or hate them but my one rule is that I don’t want them in our bed. I came home early from a trip a few nights ago to surprise my wife and — I found her and the dog layed out across the bed sleeping. Instead of waking her up, I just slept in the guest room that night.

The next morning, I surprised her and the kids with breakfast and let my wife know how I intended to surprise her the night before but saw she was in the bed with the dog. She admitted she always lets the dog sleep with her while I’m away and just washes the sheets and comforter the night before I’m supposed to be home so I “will never know”. Except now I know and I don’t want to sleep in that bed until she promises she won’t have the dog in it anymore even while I’m away. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for not helping my sister watch my nephew during a flight delay?,"Rae(25f) and I (23f) grew up in NYC. Our parents own a vacation home. When I moved out they decided to move there permanently. 

They’ve only been back once so I recently decided to visit them. 

Mom and Rae were talking and my plans came up. She called and asked why I didn’t tell her I was planning to go to Cali. I said it had nothing to do with her so why would I have to tell her anything. 

She said it made no sense for us to do separate trips when we could just go together. I said she’s acting extremely entitled to something she had no parts in and I’m not obligated to include her in every plan I make. She said she just wants our parents to meet her son. I said he’s like 5 months you had plenty of time to take him if it was important.

Then she cried to mom. Ma said it was a good idea. I said if Rae cared so much she would’ve planned to see them on her own. She told me she really needs this. 

I told Rae if she comes she can’t ask me for shit I’m not helping with her kid act like I’m not even there. She agreed. 

The day came and our connecting flight was delayed so we had to stay the night. I was trying to fall asleep. She asked me if I was really going to sleep. I was annoyed. I said “If you leave me tf alone.” 

Later she asked me to watch the baby. I said just hold him and go to sleep. She was scared someone would snatch him while she slept. I said she sounds fkn crazy and no one wants her kid. She said she was exhausted and had been drinking energy drinks all night but she was crashing and tried to put him in my arms again. I said “This is exactly why you should’ve just stayed tf at home. I told you from jump I’m not doing shit. You already forced your way here now you’re just gonna have to figure it out.” She said “Seriously? I’m fkn exhausted I can barely even keep my eyes open“ I said “Then go to sleep“ and closed my eyes. She knew what the terms were.

We made it there but later mom asked if she really raised me to be so cold towards my sister. She told me she had broken down and had a mental meltdown. I said I love my sister but she should grow up and stop being so dramatic about a situation she put herself in. She said it wouldn’t have hurt to help her even just a little. I told her I didn’t help her make the baby and she should’ve known something could go wrong when traveling. 

We got back a week ago and haven’t spoken to each other at all but she texted me today how hurt she was and she feels like I don’t care about her or my nephew at all. I told her she knew what she was getting into when she begged to come and imposed on my trip. She said she thought I would’ve changed my mind when I realized we would have to sleep in the airport and that she would’ve done it for me. I said “Your kid. You’re responsibility.” I might be willing to just apologize to shut her up if people say I’m the AH.",Asshole
AITA for telling my friend her wife doesn't wear her wedding ring at work?,"I've (33F) been friends with Charlotte (33F) since we were little girls. Despite being close to her and her daughter (5F), I don't really see her wife Avery (35F) much. She doesn't get along with most of our friends with Charlotte and is a private person which is extremely fine.

Avery is a Cardiologist. My Mother in law's sister is sick and I asked Charlotte if she could arrange an appointment for us from her wife. She called and said she had arranged it. I decided to accompany my MIL and her sister to the office. 

It all went well but I noticed Avery did not have her wedding ring on. During the whole visit, she did not even mention Charlotte until I said something. And everyone addressed her as Dr while the other times she insisted on Mrs. It was kind of weird to me because she always has worn it when I've seen her. (Actually the few times we were out Avery always wore her ring and acted like it was very important to her). I don't know what was going on but I thought as her good friend, I should mention this to Charlotte. 

The next time I met up with her I said I had noticed that Avery was not wearing her wedding ring at her office. She laughed and asked me what I was getting at and I said I just wanted to mention what I had seen and I didn't mean anything. Charlotte said Avery is a very 'by the book' person and never wears any jewelry in her office or at the hospital.

I apologised and only said I thought it was weird that she didn't wear it and didn't mention anything about her wife despite knowing who I was. Charlotte told me she just explained and that I needed to let it go. I let it go but she is still clearly upset.

My other friends told me I should not have mentioned it and I should apologise to Charlotte. I still smell something fishy going on but I don't know.",Asshole
AITA for telling my sister-in-law she can't bring her baby to our wedding?,"I (28F) am getting married to my fiancé (30M) in a few months, and we're in the middle of finalizing all the details for our big day. One thing that's been causing a bit of tension is the fact that my sister-in-law (27F) just had a baby a few weeks ago, and she's been insisting that she bring the baby to the wedding.

We've made it clear from the beginning that we don't want children at our wedding, as we want it to be an adult-only affair. We've communicated this to all our guests, including my sister-in-law, but she's been pushing back and saying that she can't possibly leave her newborn at home.

I understand that she's a new mom and that it can be tough to leave your baby, but I feel like she's being unreasonable. This is our special day, and we've planned it to be a certain way. It's not fair for her to come in and disrupt that.

I tried to explain this to her, but she got really upset and accused me of not caring about her or her baby. She's even threatened to not come to the wedding at all if we don't allow the baby.

AITA for telling on my daughter’s friend,"My daughter is 8, and she had a friend, let’s call her Jane, over for a sleepover. I was more than happy to host her, prepared activities for them and everything went great. This morning, my daughter and Jane insisted on making breakfast, which was fine. I allowed them to make toast while I made eggs and smoothies for them.

They must have messed with the settings on the toaster, and the bread came out a little burnt. Jane said something along the lines of ew what happened and before I could react, she picked it up and put it in the trash. I was appalled and shocked. For context I didn’t grow up with much so tossing food in the trash is not something I’ve done or seen.

Although I understand she’s a child, I explained to her that this isn’t okay, people work hard to afford food etc. and of course my daughter was very embarrassed which is understandable from her perspective. What is crazy is Jane’s moms reaction who informed me that my behavior was unacceptable and I had no right to call out her child and it was probably traumatic for her. She took no accountability for Jane's actions.

Now three people are upset and I'm here thinking AITA?

Edit: It’s not as much about the loss of the slice of toast as the nonchalance with which it was just tossed away that was surprising. Just to clarify.

Edit 2: I was shocked, as in it took me by surprise. It was unexpected. I didn’t yell at her, I just explained that throwing food away isn’t okay, and why that is. She seemed to take it pretty well, but must have informed her mom as well. I didn’t see her mom in-person because I dropped them off to school after.",Asshole
AITA for telling my step kids to stop hanging off their mom?,"I will be the first to admit that I grew up in a very ""hands off"" type of family. There was no hugging, snuggling or anything of the sort. So when I met my wife and saw her three kids love on her so much, it did make me incredibly uncomfortable. BUT that was a me issue and I just checked myself in to therapy and worked through it. Now the kids are like this with me and sometimes it's still hard but it doesn't make me nearly as uncomfortable as it did. However, my wife is fully aware of this because through therapy I was taught ways to communicate these things to her. So I never asked the kids to stop and never tried forcing my opinions but I did communicate WHY I became so weird about it. So she knows.

Anyways, fast forward to now.. my step kids are currently 13, 11 and 7. All of them are still very much so snuggly kids and easily wrap my wife up on the couch 4 times a day. The ONLY issue I currently have is that my wife is currently pregnant. High risk. They have her on bed rest and she's only 16 weeks. I simply do not like how rough the kids seem to be with her. Though they might not actually be super rough but it seems like it to me and I'm worried about my wife and my unborn child. Like my 7yo step son will still lay on his mother's chest (granted he also is a small kid and has some ailments: ASD and ODD). I don't want him laying on his mother's chest. Or the two older ones will lay beside her but like.. half on her. I don't want them doing this either because their legs/half of their torso is on top of their mothers stomach and again, she's high risk. I don't want them unintentionally hurting her. So whenever I see it now, I either tell them to stop or constantly remind them to be careful of their mothers stomach. 

My wife flipped yesterday. She never snaps but she absolutely did this time and told me quite bluntly to ""shut my fucking mouth"" because if my attitude makes it so her kids stop snuggling her, she will never forgive me. Insists she is fine and if she wasn't she would say something. It's been tense here. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for not caring about someone's death?,"My (17f) mother (50f) died 1 year ago due to cancer. It was shocking for my family but oh well death is inevitable it eventually happens to everyone. I didn't have the best relationship with my mother due to her mostly favoring my sister (19f) so I didn't really care when she died, it was like waking up to see that the person you see everyday no longer wants to see you.



Here's the issue. I don't like being around people that are constantly crying so I skipped most of my mother's funeral and went home to play some video games and take care of my cat. My sister is still mad about me skipping the funeral and hasn't let go of it yet. After the funeral she threw a fit at me and called me an emotionless bi word to leave her and my father alone with our other relatives asking where I was. I told her I didn't wanna stay and this is my way of grieving, she didn't buy that. I received many calls from my aunts and uncles asking why I was absent through out the funeral and I had to waste my time explaining this is my way of grieving.



Yesterday my sister decided to visit us and my father cooked her favourite dish. My sister got emotional on the table stating how she remembered mom used to cook this dish for her and it tastes the same. I told her that was incredibly nice but she should stop crying or else I will take her potatoes (I love potatoes). She got annoyed and told me something in the lines of she's just expressing her feelings and there's nothing wrong with it and I should express my emotions too and she knows how much I also miss mom. I told her I don't about someone's death and it happens to everyone eventually and I have more important things to worry about. She threw a fit on the table and started cussing at me but my father managed to calm her down. She didn't talk to me for the rest of the day and left early in the morning.
My father told me my sister is just emotional and I should Atleast act like I'm sad about my mother's death around her. AITA?

Edit 2: Gotta love the amount of messages I'm getting telling me I'm a sociopath and I should seek therapy. No I can't seek therapy my father doesn't allow me to.

AITA for telling my boyfriend that the ‘hilarious’ videos he sends me are fake?,"My boyfriend sent me a video that he found hilarious. It was the one where people are on a Zoom call and one guy thinks he turned his camera off and goes to get lotion and tissues while his colleagues all shout at him in horror. 

I knew half way through the video that it was fake. I told him ‘that has to be scripted.’ He relied ‘I really hope it isn’t.’ I was curious so went on the web and found out it was actually an ad for an adult website. I sent the link to him. 

He got really upset that I ‘felt the need to prove him wrong.’ He said everyone else he shared the video with just ‘laughed and moved on.’ He eventually got over it and we made up. 

Recently he sent me another video where a boy shoots a nerf gun at his mother painting and she falls onto the couch and spills paint everywhere. I’m not certain but I also believe this video to be set up as well. Everything in me is telling myself not to tell him it’s fake, but the urge is strong!

One of my major annoyances with social media is so many staged videos and content, which is fine if everyone is aware that they’re fake. But the problem is a lot of people believe these are real. It’s fine for funny content but where it does matter is for political or ‘scientific’ content.

Am I the asshole for telling him it’s fake and ruining it? Should I just keep my mouth shut and pretend to laugh?

Edit: I can definitely see why me ‘trying to prove him wrong’ makes me the AH. In my mind I was genuinely curious and wanted to find out. Sort of like when you see an actor on a show and you’re convinced it’s X and someone else is convinced it’s Y and you look it up out of curiosity. I can see why that would be annoying though if someone is proved ‘wrong’.

Also, yes, I know that movies and shows are ‘fake’, but if someone else tried to tell me, ‘I hope they’re not fake’ that would be concerning. 

I can see where I’m wrong about the political or scientific content since what he sent me was neither.

I think the real issue is that I don’t find the clips funny whether they are real or scripted. We have different senses of humour sometimes and that’s okay. I need to find a way to validate his need for connection (when he sends the videos) without lying (eg fake laughing). Some people have suggested some good ideas.",Asshole
AITA for laughing at the idea of my step son becoming my daughter’s guardian if my wife and I unexpectedly passed?,"I have been married to my wife, Denise, for 5 years now. She has a son, Michael who is 18. We get along pretty well. He's a good kid with a great head on his shoulders.

This past year, my wife and I welcomed our first biological child together, Sarah. We're going through the process of updating our wills, which means choosing guardians in the event that both of us died. When Michael was younger, Denise had her parents listed, but they're now older and in no condition to take care of a baby. We asked my sister and her husband, they agreed.

We were explaining some things to Michael that came along with the will (insurance goes to him if we both pass, what he'd inherit, etc). We also explained that there was an account set up for him to get his own apartment once he finished college (he's currently a freshman), should we both pass by then. (Unlikely, but all bases covered sort of thing)

Michael then asked what would happen to Sarah. We told him our guardian choices. Michael straightened up and said that no, he would take on Sarah. I said that was very sweet, but he was still very young. Maybe we'd consider updating it in 10 or so years when he's older and more established. My wife said we'd think about it.

In private, I asked if she was seriously considering it. She pointed out that Michael spends a lot of time with her, is a good kid, etc and is volunteering. I said I wouldn't feel comfortable putting the fate of our daughter in the hands of a young adult. I said if Denise was changing her mind on my sister and brother-in-law, that was completely fine but to me, Michael is not an option and it should be a ""two yes, one no wins"" situation. She asked if it would really be so mad for Michael to become guardian and I laughed. While yes, Michael is volunteering, he has no real clue what would come with being a parent. As I said, in 10 years, when he's more established and an adult, I'd consider it. For now, it needs to be someone else.

Denise isn't upset that I don't want Michael to be the guardian, but she is upset over how dismissive I'm being and that I laughed at her. She says that I'm being hurtful and offensive to both her and her son. AITA?

Edit: I am not changing my mind on making him guardian. Please stick to the judgment I asked about.",Asshole
WIBTA for not going on a family vacation because my brother wants to bring his dog,"Pre-Covid I (33M) would go on family vacations with my family (My Parents (late 50's), Brother (27) and Sister (29)), these occurred about every other year.  For a multitude of reasons we haven't done a trip since 2018.  I am married and we have an 18 month old.  My sister has a boyfriend, and my brother has some sort of terrier and no GF I know of.

My brother has morphed into a self described ""dog dad"" and based off social media seems to rarely do things without the dog.  We live in the same city, but different areas and we don't see him all that much.  The few times i've been around his dog it behaves fine.  Its too friendly for me and I can't speak to how it behaves over multiple days or around babies.

My parents have a Vrbo beach house in Florida booked.  In a few week the deadline for a full refund for canceling is coming up and my parents need to know if we are in.  We live in the west side of the USA so we'd be flying.  I found out my brother plans to bring his dog.  My parents aren't thrilled about it but ""it is what it is"", those are my parents words.

I'm not a dog person, I despise them on airplanes.  I do not want to travel with the dog (tentatively we are on the same flight), I do not want to stay the week in the same house as the dog, I do not want activities based on being dog friendly, and I do not want the dog around my son.

Our parents want to stay out of it and have us hash it out.  I broached the topic with my brother.  Essentially he isn't flexible on the dog, it is his family and it is a family vacation.  He says my 18 month old will be far more annoying and loud than his dog.  He seems firm on this and i'm ready to pull out of the trip.  If I don't go, the trip may fall apart.  WIBTA?",Asshole
AITA because one son has to do more chores than the other?,"My kids have daily chores they have to do after school. They have to Swiffer their rooms and take out the garbage. They also alternate days to clean their bathroom mirror and the sink. However, when they have friends over, they don't have to do their chores. It's kind of awkward for the other kid to just have to sit around and twiddle their thumbs while their host is swiffering.

My 14yo gets pissed when the 12yo is at a friend's house or has a friend over and doesn't have to do his chores because it isn't fair. He doesn't have playdates every week or anything, but it still infuriates 14 when it does happen. My 14yo isn't very social and never has people over. I don't think this is a healthy mindset from him, but he's been getting angrier and angrier. Yesterday he refused to do his chores because 12 had a friend over to work on a project with, so 14yo went on chore strike and ended up getting grounded.

WIBTA if I stopped giving my son driving lessons,"My son is a learner driver and currently in driving school and I have been giving him extra driving practice which is something he wanted.

Earlier on, he was sometimes too hesitant and lacked confidence when merging on the freeway and changing lanes which can be dangerous if you go too slow or check the mirrors so much that you stop looking ahead.

I pointed this out and he is a getting better at it. However at times he still hesitates and when he does, I would tell him he is driving like a woman. He had no issue with this at all and would correct himself when I said that. I did not mean it in a bad way, my daughter is a great driver, picked up driving naturally and passed her test the first time. He got upset at me all of a sudden and asked me to stop saying that. I have no issue, stopping with that remark and replacing it with something else, but I don't appreciate being lectured as if I am sexist when I was just trying to help him, and used the phrase more like an idiom.

My wife agrees with me and thinks he was being petty but my daughter agrees with my son. My son and I used to talk like this all the time when he was younger but lately he and my daughter have become closer and she is influencing his views.

I think maybe it was wrong to say that but not asshole level since I did not mean it literally and I am more bothered about how he lectured me and treated me as if I am a massive sexist than if he had just asked me to stop. I have been happily married for many years and I am no sexist.

I was considering stopping the extra practice drives and just letting him use his paid instructor.

EDIT: Ok I get it, I will stop using the term, that was not the issue anyway, I would have had no problem if he just asked me to do so without accusing me. I was using it more like a quick idiot so he could realize for himself and correct himself without me telling him what to do, but I get how it can be considered insensitive. I however definitely do not believe women are bad drivers or anything like that.",Asshole
AITA for asking my daughter to cancel a work commitment?,"I am a proud father of three (24F, 18M and 16F). I planned for everyone in the family to go out of town as a surprise especially because things have been tough on us lately.

I called my oldest daughter, Emma and she said she couldn't make it because she had to babysit that weekend. Emma is a professional nanny and she now works full time for a family of two moms with two kids. 

I told her if she could please cancel the weekend and spend the day with us but she said that she had promised the family she'd care for their kids and that they were going out of town for a getaway without kids. 

I'm kind of sad because they're very understanding and Emma could cancel and they'd be okay but she doesn't want to. She'd rather give them a vacation than spend time with us and I told her this.

AITA for agreeing to go on a family vacation in place of our honeymoon?,"Some quick background facts: My family and family friends of ours go on vacation together every year. This has been a tradition since I was maybe eleven years old and I'm now 27. Each year, my parents and the other family's parents alternate who plans and pays for the vacation. This year is our family friends' turn.

I'm getting married in just a few weeks. We were planning on going on our honeymoon towards the end of the year but haven't put specific plans in place yet. I work for my dad and can pretty much get off whenever I'd like but she only has so much PTO, so we're trying to be strategic with our plans. I told everyone I would likely have to skip the vacation this year because of my fiancée's work situation and our honeymoon.

Last week, my ""bonus dad"" came to me and told me he had booked a room for me and my girlfriend was more than welcome to come along too if she changed her mind, but that he was insistent on the family being together for the trip. Honestly, there's nothing that can beat the vacations we take. The places are great and the company is even greater. My sister is so busy these days and lives out of state, so I get to catch up with her. The family we travel with has three sons who are some of my closest friends. Beyond all of that, you can't really beat an all expenses paid holiday.

I told my fiancée about this and she's very angry I didn't immediately shut it down. I told her that we weren't required to constantly do family activities and this could easily serve as part one to our honeymoon. We haven't started planning so there's no real plans to derail, and we can have our actual honeymoon as a first anniversary celebration since we weren't planning on going right after our wedding anyway.

AITA For getting up and lining up to exit the airplane before the people in front of me got up?,"I just got off a southwest flight (no seat assignments), and I was sat towards the very back of the plane when we landed. People at the front got up to get ready but no one in the middle section got up I was in the aisle seat and I only had a backpack, so I took the opportunity and walked to the front of the plane to lineup behind the people in the very front. 

While I was waiting to exit the airplane, the person sitting in the seat next to where I was standing asked me “have the rules changed “and I pretended not to hear him because I had headphones on and I didn’t say anything to him. Then he got up and said, “why don’t you go back to the back and wait like everyone else.” I didn’t respond again but this time there was a lady behind me who said she needed to catch her connecting flight that was already boarding. The guy then said “well the rules havent changed but if you want to be a jerk go ahead.” 

The lady who had the connecting flight definitely had a valid reason to “cut” in line, but when was this ever a rule lol? I don’t think I did anything wrong because everyone who I “skipped” could have gotten up and waited in the aisle, so AITA here?

AITA for demanding my girlfriend tells me her author’s pen name?,"I’ve (m32) been dating Siobhan (f32) for 6 months now. She’s always been very vague about what she does for a living (sati things like writing and working from home writing) but recently, one of her friends mentioned something and I finally dragged it out of her. She’s an author, she write and self published romance and erotica stories and novels and while not rich, she’s able to make a living out of it.

I googled her name and couldn’t find anything so I confronted her about this.

She said she’s writing under a pen name so I demanded she gives it to me so I know what she does.

She refuses saying she doesn’t want it to be leaked even by accident and no one knows.

I accused her of not trusting me and she still refused which was really annoying.

I tried nicer approach and told her that I want to know her fantasies so I can try it out with her and she told me that what she writes aren’t her fantasies but her readers and she’s still not going to tell me.

At night I tried to check her laptop for her pen name but she changed her password before bed. I was annoyed and told her she clearly doesn’t trust me and it’s not fair because I have a right to know what she writes especially since it’s a sensitive topic and I don’t know her if I don’t know her pen name.

She was furious I tried to look on her laptop and told me to go home. Before leaving I told her when she calls to apologize, I expect to get her pen name with the apology.

AITA for telling my girlfriend she should not drive in high heels,"My (28M) girlfriend, let's call her Emma (26F) likes wearing high heels ever since I have known her. She is self conscious about her height but it is not really a big deal when we are together as I am short. She is 5'2 and I am 5'6.

The issue however is when we go out together she normally drives as it is her car and she drives in her heels. I repeatedly tell her she should switch to flats and not drive in them as it is dangerous but she refuses and says she knows how to drive in them and is used to it and claims in some cases it is easier as you can pivot between pedals easier. I think she is not being honest as I can't possibly see how it would be easier.

Last week she got into a small accident and rear ended someone, I was not there but a car changed lanes in front of her and she rear ended it. I bought her some sneakers and told her to use them as driving shoes and left them in her car and she called me an AH and said her accident had nothing to do with her shoes and that I should drop it.

AITA here? I just want her to be safe.

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses, I can't respond to them all, but I feel I pushed the issue too much and apologized to her. The responses seem mixed but I have spoken to her more about it and I guess it is something really subjective, and depends on the design of the car, pedals, the specific shoe as not all heels are equal, drivers height, practice in them etc. In her case she says in her car, as long as she has good quality floor mats she has no issues and she prefers the seat position she uses when she drives in heels and the only shoes she has trouble with are flip flops or any shoe with slippery soles, which is fair as I have trouble in some slippery dress shoes as well.

The laws of most places seem to not call it out specifically, some have laws that vaugely say proper footwear and I saw some court cases where heels were blamed or flip flops but that is only when it could be proved they were a clear cause of the accident.

AITA for telling my SIL to grow and stop coping everything from Tiktok.,"I (42F) have a SIL (35F) she is my husbands sister. She is so easily influenced its embarrassing. Now because of tiktok she has a 5 step skincare routine, god only knows how much money she threw away on snake oil products. She spends hours following make up routines she sees on there. She now wakes up at 5am to do a workout plan from an account she follows. She is constantly cooking recipes from TikTok, going to restaurant she found on there. Everything is from Tiktok I don't think she has ever had a original thought in her life. She is 35 for God's sake, it's an app for teenagers!

Now with easter coming up she is asking to bring some butter board she saw on tiktok. It honestly sounded ridiculous. I finally decided to say something to her. I explained to her how its embarrassing how she is still trying to act like a teenager, no amount of skincare and 5AM workouts will stop her from aging. She is 35 she is going to have wrinkles, we all went though it now its her turn, she is just wasting money and its time to grow up and accept how old she is, she is no longer a teenager and that's ok, we all age. I explained to her that her life is flying by she is married with no children. She is 35 I fear she is going to wake up in a few years and regret not having children and wasting so much of her time worried about what she looks like.  

She told me forget it  she won't even come to easter. She told me ""Just because I gave up on myself doesn't mean she need too."" Which was incredibly rude and unnecessary sorry I have two kids to take care of I don't have time to worry about wrinkles or if my outfit is perfect. She then hung up.

Now my in-laws are pissed and they have decided to do easter at their house since SIL now feel too uncomfortable coming to our house. And of course she will be making her ridiculous butter board. My husband agrees that she needs to grow up but thinks I should have kept my mouth shut and should apologize so we can have a nice easter.

AITA for not treating all of my kids the same?,"My husband (42m) and I (33f) have been in a relationship for four years. However, we did not introduce children until the second year. 

Recently, my stepdaughter (10f)accused me of not loving her as much as my biological children (1f, 5m,7m, 9f). While I assured her that I love her deeply and she means the world to me, I also explained that my love for my biological children is different as I have been with them since their birth.

UPDATE:
I wrote my post at around 11 in the morning and I realised I fucked up badly. 

I asked my stepdaughter to come downstairs as we needed to talk. I started by apologising to her for what I said.  I told her that the love between me and my biological children comes naturally but the love I have for her developed as I got to know her beautiful personality. She told me she forgave me but I know for a fact I am going to have to do a lot more than apologise to her for her to forgive me fully. I asked her if she would like to go shopping, just us and she agreed, we got to know each other so much better and we had the most fun we’ve ever had together.

AITA for announcing my pregnancy immediately after my sister?,"My husband and I have been trying for our second baby for two and a half years. We lost 2 pregnancies during that time, though we only told our families about the first. I’m incredibly grateful to now be 13 weeks pregnant and have been looking forward to sharing that news with my family. 

On Friday, we had dinner with my family - my sister, her boyfriend, and our parents - and we decided to share our news then. I decided to wait until dessert, so that we could leave shortly after telling everyone. Obviously, it’s exciting news, but I was worried about all the emotions that could surface for myself and my husband.

Right after we sat down to eat, my sister announced that she and her boyfriend are expecting their first child. I was thrilled for her and congratulated her, as did the rest of the family. Once things had settled down, I didn’t want to waste the opportunity to have everyone together and thought it would be a good opportunity to keep the joy flowing, so I shared that I’m pregnant as well.

Our parents were so excited to be having two new grandbabies just a month apart and I was super happy that my kids would have a new cousin. My sister was happy for me but she left very soon after dinner and didn’t stay for dessert.

She called me this afternoon and told me that as happy as she was for me, she felt that I’d done a shitty thing by taking away “her moment.” She pointed out that this is my second baby and when I announced for the first time, I didn’t have to “share” with anyone. I didn’t want to apologize because I didn’t feel I’d done anything wrong, but she finished out the phone call by saying that she didn’t think I was really even happy for her, if I couldn’t have let her have that moment and taken another for myself later on. That really stung.

I truly didn’t see it that way. I saw it as sharing joy, not stealing it. I also see each pregnancy as being unique, so I don’t feel that it was right of her to say I shouldn’t have said anything because it was my second baby. Honestly, I think she might be kind of hormonal. But I also want to understand my sister and I know I’m not going to get anywhere asking her about it. So, I want to be enlightened.

I want to get the condo and have the girls in one room and my son in the other. My wife doesn't want her daughter to share a room with the twins so she either wants the 4 bedroom house or if we have to get a 3 bedroom, she wants to have the twins share with our son until we can eventually add a 4th bedroom or her daughter goes to college and won't be traveling with us as much. 

I tried to compromise and find a house that has a 4th bedroom for my stepdaughter but is still walkable but my wife still doesn't like it because her daughter would be in the basement while the rest of us would be on the 2nd floor. She says this house would isolate her daughter. Then she said she doesn't even want to be able to walk to the shops and restaurants because the double stroller is too bulky to bring into half of them, she'll have to deal with our son complaining about his feet hurting, and she can't even make that walk with the kids half the year when it's snowing.

I’ve been going to the gym in the morning but she says she doesn’t have time with the baby, which I understand. I also usually work late so I assumed she would be making healthy dinners since she’s at home and she did for a couple of weeks but then she got back into buying unhealthy fast food. We spoke about this many times and she said she would try to make time and it seemed great, until I realize I had lost almost 15 lbs and she has gained 5. We had a discussion about it and she was immediately very defenses and admitted when I am not home she gets herself fast food and does not work out at all. I know she is insecure about her body and to be honest I don’t find her very attractive any more either, of course I don’t say this to her face. Instead I decided to try and help her and this is we’re a may or fucked up.

AITA for cancelling my GF’s tattoo appointment.,"My GF has OCD- one symptom she experiences is her doing everything in 5s. 

Her Mother passed away in March of 2018. 

My GF goes to Therapy, and in January of this year when she bought up getting a tattoo for the 5th anniversary of her Mother’s death, I suggested she talked about it with her therapist. After doing so, she said that her therapist also didn’t think it was a good idea, as she believed that the drive behind her wanting to get the tattoo was her OCD, rather than the actual WANT of getting it. 

However, my GF still went ahead and booked the appointment. After talking with a couple friends about it, they all agreed that it wasn’t a good idea to make such a permanent decision which has purely been fuelled by her OCD. 

If she had somewhat recovered from her OCD, I wouldn’t be so hesitant. However, she hasn’t made any progress. 

I emailed the tattooist (we have each other’s passwords) and cancelled her appointment. I told her an hour before her appointment that it had been cancelled, and as she had booked the last slot for the day, she was unable to get it done. 

I knew she was going to be upset, but I didn’t really realise HOW upset she was going to be. It’s been a couple of weeks, and it’s honestly crazy how she’s reacted to it, but I am more than certain (and so are our friends) that in the future once she recovers from her OCD, she will be really grateful. It’s clear that it was OCD influenced, as it has flared up a bit because of it- and she’s aware of that too- and has described it as making her physically sick when she thinks about the fact she’ll never be able to get a tattoo on the 5th year anniversary.

AITA for choosing not to pay for my daughter's university fees despite paying for her brothers?,"My (57M) daughter Jane (21F) has recently been accepted into the university of her choice ,now me and my wife (55F) are glad with this news , the only thing is that Jane got accepted to do an English degree.

Now Jane, compared to her two brothers Mark (28M) and Leo (30M) was quite late in applying to university. When me and my wife asked her to start at 18 she claimed that she was not ready and wanted to have a ""little rest"", a little rest being going out with friends and travelling the whole of last year with her boyfriend.

It should be noted that I supplied Jane with all the money needed for her little rest .

Now me and my wife have nothing against Jane doing what she did, she's young and young people live to explore and do what they do, however before me and my wife allowed for Jane to do her thing we made her promise that when she did apply to university it was for a degree that was worth it - Jane was going through a weird phase where she wanted to be many things that were more on the creative side.

Fast forward a year later we find out that Jane's gone behind our backs and applied for an English degree.

Both Leo and Mark took medical degrees and are now very good, well payed doctors. One would think that this would motivate Janet to go on the same path but instead she has decided to be ""herself"".

I sat down Jane last night and told her that if she decided to go through with the English degree, I would not support her at all and that she would have to take out her own student loan, at this she began crying claiming that I was the ""worst dad ever"" and had always favoured her brothers over her (because I had paid for their university fees) - now this is totally incorrect I did literally pay for her travel all of last year.

My sons think that I'm being too harsh and that I should simply support Jane regardless of what she chooses, but is it too much to ask of my daughter to follow through with an actually useful degree?

EDIT: No, my daughter's year of travel does not add up to her brothers tuition fees, not even close. For those wondering I work as a cardiologist. 

Me not wanting my daughter to do an English degree is not because I'm sexist but because I want her to do something useful which she can live off instead of depending on me for the rest of her life.

AITA for asking my girlfriend to not wear indian clothes to work.,"I (27M) am American and my girlfriend (28F) is British and ethnically half Indian. She is not religious and culturally very British, speaks with a British accent etc.

We live in the US and recently started living together. She works at a tech company. I noticed about half the days when she goes to work, she dresses in Indian clothes, even her heels are shiny gold or silver. The look is stuff like [this](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0182/1471/5470/products/AASHIRWAD-7083B_1500x1500.jpg). She looks really cute and I think it is fine for a party or festival, but it looks really out of place for the American workplace.

I have Indian friends in American and the women dress western here except for festivals.

I told her to tone it down a bit as it looks out of place in America and she might face discrimination and some of the heels look too unprofessional for the work place.

I work at a bank and everyone is dressed really formal.

She got upset and told me she will wear whatever she pleases and is acting cold towards me. I did not push it as ultimately it is her choice and she can face the consequences.

Was I the AH here? She does not even like India and criticizes the place all the time and the politics there and she identifies as British.

AITA for taking my dog into the grocery store for no more than 10 minutes," I (F33) am a proud owner of Peanut, my Yorkshire Terrier.  I took Peanut to the dog park today and Petsmart.  In the same complex is the grocery store I go to.  It was a warmer day and didn't want to leave Peanut in the car. So I leashed him up and took him in with me.  

I had planned on a quick trip, no more than ten minutes. I went to the produce department to grab some stuff.  A guy, probably in his 30's, not an employee, rudely told me that pets aren't allowed in grocery stores and asked why I had my dog with me.  Before I could respond he told me it was gross as fuck to have my dog in the produce section.   I explained it was hot out and I planned to be quick in the store.  I apologized and said the most convenient thing for me was to come here with Peanut.  He told me to fuck off and not to be a lazy pet owner. Then he stormed off. It was a bit of a scene.  Feeling uncomfortable, I just left.  I thought it'd be no big deal, Peanut didn't misbehave or have an accident, And I didn't think I was being an asshole.",Asshole
AITA for not letting my friend bring his service dog over,"Throwaway

My (M39) friend (M38)  recently got a service dog, its a diabetic alert dog.  The issue arises in that he wants to bring it to my house when I host hangouts/parties.  I'm not much of a dog person and really don't want it at my house.  It is a breed that sheds and I don't want to have to deal with dog hair in my house.  Also my kids regularly play in our yard and I don't want them to encounter dog poop and pee. 

I've spend the last 10 years in this house turning it into a place my friends, family and I could hang out.  I have a pool, I built a bar in my basement, those types of upgrades.  I offered to meet out at a restaurant or someone else's place and host less, but my house is the preferred destination among everyone else.  I have amenities that others don't and there are no expensive food and bar tabs at my place.  I host a lot during football season and other major sporting events, with some general hangouts in between.

I told my friend that his dog wasn't welcome.  I offered to pay for a monitoring device he can use while at my house, but he didn't take that offer well.  He let me know he wasn't happy and recently missed our Super Bowl get together.  AITA?",Asshole
AITA for naming my daughter the name my SIL wanted,"I 23f have been married to my husband for 2 years, together since high school. I recently just had a baby. We decided not to tell anyone the name till the baby was born. 

My SIL was also pregnant. We both had very similar names in mind. I liked Mary-Grace. My SIL liked the names Mary-Kay. My SIL did choose the name first, but our names weren’t identical. SIL still insisted I didn’t use Mary-Grace still.

We did anyways and when I announced My SIL called us and had a cow. She said we disrespected her knowing she picked the name first and now she has to choose a new baby such short notice. We reminded SIL that the names aren’t identical and there is no reason to change, but she just got upset and hung up.

My MIL soon called us later backing up SIL saying how childish we acted keeping it a secret so we could get our way, and SIL wanted to use that name after her grandmother. They are all pretty upset with us. Aita",Asshole
AITA for being mad my fiancé wont cook for my son?,"I (29F) have been with my fiancé (34M) for over a year now and together we have 3 kids. Two from his preivous relationship and one from mine. We have been learning how to coparent but it hasnt always been easy. For context, my fiancé LOVES to cook. It's his passion and he has always done majority of the cooking, espically dinner, ever since our first date. His two kids, (4 and 6) also love majority of the things he makes. My son(8), however, is a very picky eater. I know its partly my fault for not knowing how to cook and for being a single mom for so many years I just used the easy way out.

Well, when I met my fiancé and saw how bad our diets were (lots of chicken nuggets and ramen) I really wanted to make it better. However, the changes have not been easy for my son. There has been a lot of complaining and nose turning at the new foods for the last year. And Its not always anything fancy, even spaghetti he refuses to eat. This is where things got fustrating.

Tonight, my fiancé was going to cook enchalidas for dinner and my son, as ususal, didnt want it and asked for nuggets. My fiance basically threw up his hands while prepping dinner and has now said that he will no longer cook for this household because he is tired of his food be snarked and pushed away. He says I can do what I want for my son and I but he will no longer be disrespected. I am extremely upset and all I see is red. Granted, I know he doesnt have to cook for me but I have fallen in love with his food and I feel so damn fustrated. Am I the asshole or is he right?

EDIT: I dont just let me son be a complete uncontrolled brat to my fiancé. If he whines or gets bratty he is punished or grounded. Every meal, I hype my fiancés food, hoping he'll want to eat too and that sometimes works! And even if he doesnt take much, I make sure he tells my fiancé thank you for cooking. And I'll make him apologize if he says something disrespectfully. I do realize my fiancé is coming into a situation he didnt create.",Asshole
AITA for telling someone they’re selfish for asking a 22 year old to become a child’s guardian?,"My (22F) boyfriend “Malcolm” (22M) has a half-sister, “Elena” (12F). They have the same dad and he’s not involved in their lives. Their moms became close friends and they were raised seeing one another. Malcolm’s mom moved abroad a couple of years ago. 

Elena’s mom “Sandra” was diagnosed with cancer last year. She went through treatment but it’s been determined that there’s nothing they can do but make her comfortable. Sandra will pass sometime this year. She has no family. Malcolm has spent a lot of time helping care for Elena, driving her to school, making them meals, etc. 

Recently, Malcolm sat me down. He said that Sandra asked to speak to him. She said she understood if the answer was no but asked for him to take on custody of Elena, sooner rather than later that way she could adjust to him being her guardian before she passes. Malcolm would move in with them. Sandra had a sizable life insurance policy and an account to help him care for Elena.

To my surprise, he agreed to all of this without consulting me. I pointed this out and he said we’ve only been together 6 months. I asked didn’t he feel too young for all this. He said sort of, but he’d do it for Elena. Without further discussion, he subleased his apartment and moved in with Sandra and Elena. 

Saturday, I stopped by to pick up Malcolm for lunch. He hadn’t returned from work yet so I was waiting with Sandra. We were making small talk. She mentioned how grateful she was for Malcolm and that he was a sweet boy. I asked if he was really her only option. I mentioned his mom. Sandra said Elena is losing enough, she doesn’t want to force her to move abroad on top of everything. She also doesn’t feel right asking Malcolm’s mom to move back. 

I said I found the whole thing a little selfish. Malcolm is only 22. He shouldn’t be tied down raising a child. Sandra got defensive and said she wished she didn’t have to ask him, plus he said yes. I asked what else was he supposed to say. Sandra told me I was upsetting her and asked me to leave.

Malcolm called me later, screaming at me. He said that I upset Sandra. I said I was trying to defend him and point out options she may not have thought of. Malcolm told me to butt out and to get on board with this or walk away. He hasn’t spoken to me since. I saw Elena at the mall on Sunday and she ignored me.

AITA my girlfriend says im constantly criticizing her but i think she’s adding malicious intent to my simple questions,"Understand that my gf is on the spectrum while i am neurotypical at best.  Sometimes she does strange or questionable things that i cannot understand why she would do that. So i usually tend to question her on alot of the things she does and its something that i do with most people. And its usually pretty simple things like “why do you always carry so many things in your bag” “why would u walk over there instead of over here” “why are you doing this versus that”. There is zero judgement they’re just reflex questions. But she says that she feels like im criticizing her. But i dont understand why she doesnt just stand firm in whatever she’s doing. Its not like im saying what she’s doing is wrong im just wondering why she does what she does. 

Most of my friends and family would stand firm in whatever their doing and brush me off by either saying idk or because i want to. Since im questioning simple stuff. And ill accept that and move on. But my gf is convinced that im criticizing her. Aita?

"AITA for keeping my girlfriend up, because she locked me out of our shared bedroom?","I (m 30) perpetually have trouble sleeping and sometimes will need to or get up from the bed and try sleeping in a different bedroom or spend some time on the couch. My girlfriend (30 f) is a light sleeper so this can cause problems when I enter and exit the room. I try as best I can to be quiet when I enter and exit, but sometimes I can be clumsy or not light on my feet, causing her to wake up. Even when I do nothing other than enter, and go directly to my side of the bed. Usually I sleep in my office to avoid coming in and out of the bedroom, which wakes her up. We have two spare bedrooms, so sleeping arrangements generally aren’t the problem.

Last night I felt like I was actually going to be able to sleep, and I decided I wanted to sleep with her. She had work the next morning. After about 10 minutes of laying beside her, I felt like I was too hungry to sleep, so I wen’t to kitchen to make some food. I accidentally banged a pot and cupboard, which caused her to yell at me, after which I heard her lock the door of our shared bedroom. We had designated one of each of the spare bedrooms to either of us and the master bedroom is ours both to share.

I pay both our rent and I felt like her taking control of the shared bedroom was unfair and disrespectful. I demanded she let me in to our shared bedroom, and she responded that I should sleep somewhere else, because, I won’t be able to sleep, which will result in her not being able to sleep. I didn’t feel that locking me out of our shared bedroom was either respectful or ‘fair’ - because she could just as easily use a spare room if she has trouble sleeping. Eventually, after pounding the door, she let me in, where after I slept and she went to the other room.

She is extremely angry at me (it is now the following day) and insists that I’m wrong in asserting that locking me out of our shared bedroom is ‘no bueno’, and knocking on the door until she let me in. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for not wanting to be driven around by women including my gf,"When I (27M) was a kid, I had a traumatic experience and was in an accident in the school bus which was being driven by a lady. Since then I have always had a phobia of being a passenger in a vehicle being driven by a woman.

My mom did not drive and even when my older sister learned to drive, I refused to drive with her even though my other siblings did. I have my license but not a car and when I take public transit, I also take the next bus if a woman is driving.

This is a phobia and I do not think women should not drive or anything.

Recently my gf and I moved in together and she has a car. She is really upset with me as, whenever we go out together I insist on driving her car. She says it feels like I am misogynistic when it is just a phobia. I said I would be ok taking public transit and she can drive her car and we could travel separately but she thinks that is not a solution and that i should ""get over it"".

AITA for asking my buddy and his girlfriend to leave a March Madness watch party,"Throwaway

My college made the NCAA Tournament and its not a common thing for where I went to school.  I have a basement bar and so I invited my friends that went to the same school over for a watch party.  There were about a dozen of us core group members plus some spouses and kids.  We all went to the same school and half of us are season ticket holders of the basketball team.  We are pretty passionate fans.  If we made the Sweet 16, we'd consider going out for that. 

In the lead up I got a text from one friend saying he would be bringing his new girlfriend who I had never met before.  Which I was fine with.  When I host watch parties they are social events but we all intently watch and cheer on our school.  Everyone shows up early, we are all eating, drinking, and watching all the other games.  My buddy shows up with his girlfriend, but they are both wearing our opponents clothes.  Its a what the fuck moment for many of my friends and I.  1, our buddy went to school with us, 2, he should know better than to bring people rooting for our opponent around at an event like this.

I go confront him and say what the hell is this regarding his shirt.  He introduces me to his girlfriend and tells me she went to the school we were playing that day.  I tell him its dumb he isn't wearing clothes for the school he went to and told them I appreciate them showing but they should watch the game somewhere else.  He seems stunned, and goes I thought it'd be fine.  I said if it was a regular season game maybe, but not a Tourney game.  He starts argueing, but I just repeat it'd be better if they left.  He starts calling me an asshole and continues argueing.  I just lead them out of the house.  He sent me a few angry texts, but I didn't want people supporting our opponent at this party.

AITA for refusing to punish my son for calling his classmate’s food weird?,"I (F32) got a private text this morning from the mother of my son’s (M7) classmate. She told me that apparently my son has been calling her daughter’s traditional lunch weird and things as such and apparently that is making her daughter feel uncomfortable and insecure. She asked me to please talk to my son about being more sensitive and respectful so her daughter doesn’t feel excluded.

Now, I feel for this woman as a fellow mother. No one wants to see their child feeling sad, but overcoming insecurities is a big part of growing up. Additionally, I thought it was ridiculous of her to criticize my son, a 7 year old, for making relatively innocuous and curious comments about food that is not familiar to him. He’s at a curious age and is discovering the world, and I refuse to try and limit him and shut him down for not having the emotional sensitivity of an adult.

Politely, I told that mother that I was sorry her daughter was struggling with insecurities, and I found some online parenting articles about building your child’s confidence to send to her so she could use some tips to help her daughter out.

She replied and said I was acting completely shamelessly and disgracefully, and I am not able to text her anymore. AITA?",Asshole
AITA For telling my sister she's not a victim," (Repost, not sure why it was removed right after posting, maybe I didn't join the sub? Anyways potential mods reading please let me know.)

To give some context, my family and a lot of our family friends are into the music industry, in particular my sister is a DJ, (I was always more of a film guy), and she is a great and talented DJ whose music I love so much and I’m so happy she’s found her passion in life.

One day however she makes a post on Instagram going on a lecture about how female DJ’s in the industry aren’t given the same opportunities men are, and that she’s been a victim of this experience.

I laughed when she brought this up for a few reasons, one, she and I come from a fairly wealthy family and has given me and my sister so many opportunities in life for our education and careers.

Two, she enjoys a -lot- of my mother’s contacts in the DJ industry that have given her many and -big- quality gigs before, abroad and locally.

Three, I pointed out my best friend whose father is a high earning DJ has practically had to forge his own path as a DJ on his own without any help and has significantly less opportunities in the field than her.

She got really pissy with me over it as she usually does when someone challenges her, and I told her she’s not a victim in the slightest.

AITA for asking my boyfriend's sister and her friends to leave the house.,"My boyfriend and I (both 33) still live with our parents so we never get to have quality *alone time* together. Last weekend his parents were away on vacation. We planned a romantic dinner on Saturday at his parents house since it was free. We went shopping for groceries and wine and when we got back to the house ready to start our date night his sister (25) was there with a bunch of her friends in the backyard having a BBQ. She has also had people over the night before.

We were both disappointed since she usually works overnight on Saturdays. She claims she always had this Saturday off but we think she probably requested the day off since the house would be free. I explained to her our plans and she said no worries they were in the backyard so no one would bother us in the kitchen and we could still have our date night.

We opened our wine and started to cook but her and her friends were being so loud and kept coming in the use the bathroom down the hall from the kitchen. We had enough I went outside and told her they were being too loud and it was unacceptable when she knew we were trying to have our date night. I asked her if she and her friends could please move their BBQ to another location. She was able to have her friends over last night and this was our night to use the house. She coped and attitude with me and said she lived here and I was just a guest so I had no right to demand they leave. She again said we could be in the kitchen and they would not brother us. 

I was pissed and so was my bf, we made our dinner ate and then I just went home. They were still outside hanging out when I left. I made a comment to her on the way out that maybe it was time to grow up and if she were to actually ever be in a relationship she would understand how important it is to have alone time. she just rolled her eyes.

This morning my boyfriend called me to say this is parents are not happy with me. He suggested we hangout at my house for a while until it blows over. How am I in the wrong? We planned around her schedule we picked Saturday because she always works Saturday. She had friends over Friday so how is it fair that we can't get our own night to use he house just like she did.",Asshole
AITA for not wanting to cancel our honeymoon despise what happened with my brother in law?,"My husband (m32) and I (f24) just got married a three weeks ago and we are currently celebrating our honeymoon. The plan was to travel for two months for different countries of Europe, Asia and Africa. We currently are in Spain and we are supposed to take a plane to Morocco in two days. However my husband wants to cut the trip short and go back to our home now. 

The thing is his brother is in a horrible situation, his wife and daughter had a car crash and they're on the hospital. The kid is fine but his wife has to be a little longer in the hospital, that's all I know. I told my husband that I understand he wants to support his brother but that he's not a doctor so he can't do anything to help really. And his brother's wife is fine, she probably only has a broken leg or something and that's why she needs some more days in the hospital. I told him to just call his brother and ask to talk with his wife so he can send her his best wishes and that's all that he can do honestly. His parents and his in laws are helping with the kids so there's really nothing they need help in. I told him our honeymoon was important because it's a time for ourselves to enjoy and spend together. 

He wasn't having any of it, he called me selfish and then he kicked me out of our bedroom, I had to ask for a new one until he decided to let me in again. He told me that he's leaving tomorrow because he needs to be supportive of his brother and told me I can continue the trip by myself.

About 10 minutes into the first set I light up a joint, and about 5 minutes after the husband complains to me about his wife being pregnant. I told them both it’s a show.

AITA for wanting my pregnant wife to see a less intimidating obstetrician?,"My (29M) wife (26F) is pregnant and as such we have been seeing an obstetrician (41M). He is a really imposing guy, both physically (very tall and fit) and in terms of personality. He has had a really hostile and condesendent attitude towards me since we first met for apparently no reason. The first time we were there, my wife was carrying a big purse and, as soon as we went inside, he started questioning me for not carrying it myself and let my pregnant wife do that effort. I was surprised by that and don't like confrontations so I just took the purse myself and apologise to my wife. The issue is that things have only gotten worse since then.

Whenever he has to explain medical things to me, he talks in a really belittling way as if I was a little kid. He acts frustrated and derisive any time I ask something, making me feel like an idiot. He does not talk like that to my wife and she explains that it is because of her being a nurse and the doctor then knowing she is more knowledgeable than me with that kind of medical stuff. He also calls me by my last name but not in a respectful manner, just in a weird and cold way, while calling my wife ""Lily"".

My wife seems to really like him. He always gives her compliments about how she looks and congratulates her for being so great at everything related to the pregnancy. I told my wife I wanted us to leave him and go to a different doctor but she is refusing. She says that changing would be stressful to her and that she doesn't have any problem with him. She argues that how she feels should be the only thing that matters because she is the pregnant one but I think that is a little unfair. We have been in conflict about this and it is even harder than an normal argument because the pregnancy makes her so emotional and irrational.

AITA for making my daughters wear dresses when they visit their grandparents?,"My in-laws are what you would call traditional. They seem to think the world should have stopped 50 years ago, and think everthing since then is evil.

My husband and I have three children (16f, 14f, 10m) and we go to visit all their grandparents since they live close. Here's the issue, they don't like the idea of women wearing pants. My MIL says it's ""showing off"" and my FIL always says it isn't christian. Now I'm pretty feminine, so I don't mind throwing on a dress when we stop by, but our daughters are not.

They don't like visiting my husbands parents, which breaks his heart, because we make them put on a dress before they go. They are both pretty tomboyish, and they never wear any dresses otherwise. I had to but each of them a few dresses specifically so they can go. To be clear it's not like they aren't allowed over if they wear pants, it's just that they won't shut up the entire time about how much they hate it.

Our daughters hate this, and think it's unfair. I guess it is, but in a lot of cultures women only wear skirts and dresses so I don't think it's a big deal. Plus it isn't like it hurts them to wear a dress a few times a week for a few hours.

AITA for calling my son inconsiderate?,"Throwaway account for privacy reasons.

I(46f) have twins (19m) and another son (16m). My son loves to cook and bake. To him it’s his source of relaxation. Alfredo, burgers, pizza, you name it. Heck even a whole cake he can make it. Everyone who’s met him knows he’s a fantastic cook.
However, he prefers to only cook for himself and gets really annoyed when my twins walk in on him cooking and ask him to make them food as well. He’ll end up doing it but he does it very begrudgingly and usually gives them a much smaller portion than his own serving, which my twins don’t like. They both have jobs, and will sometimes use their job money to buy us all a little fast food. So they find it really upsetting how their younger brother never returns the favor by primarily cooking for himself.
The other day, neither of my twins had class and weren’t really in the mood for the food that we had in the house. My son came back from school and decided to make himself some banana pudding. When my twins asked for some as well, he told them they could just make it themselves and the ingredients were all still there.
My son put the banana pudding in the fridge and went to go take a shower while it was chilling. When he came back down he saw that my twins had eaten it all and this really upset him. 
When he told me about the situation I confronted the twins to which they said it was really rude for him to only make something for himself knowing that they were hungry as well and like he said, he could always make some more. I told my son that while they shouldn’t have eaten his food that they were right, and he was very inconsiderate. My son replied that it’s not fair how he gets back from school and is expected to make food for his older siblings. That they can just get a cookbook and learn how to make things for themselves. I told my son that if he’s not going to cook for everybody than he can’t cook anymore. 
He’s been pretty moody ever since. Obviously his brothers shouldn’t have eaten his food but it takes no effort to just make a larger portion of the food he’s cooking so that everybody can have it.

AITA for telling my kids that their younger siblings' rules are different because I learned from them?,"
When I first had kids, I was one of those parents that had a ""no dating until age 16"" rule. It was partially cultural, but I thought it would allow my kids to be more mature and go about it more safely because they'd be older. I didn't really take into account that my kids were going to be in school all day 5 days a week, what technology would be, or even just that development doesn't have some kind of set age. 

The rule ended up creating an environment of secrecy and the real rule became ""just don't let dad find out"", which is the exact opposite of what I wanted. It created far more problems for everyone, got my oldest into preventable situations they shouldn't have been in and required my youngest to lie to herself and to me for trying to follow it.

I realized that I needed to change my opinion. More than anything, I was trying to keep them safe, and having a hard and fast rule was doing the opposite. My youngest two have a wide age gap from the oldest, so when they got to the age, I decided to not have a hard minimum, but to foster open communication so that there could be reasonable supervision if things came up. 

My son ended up going on his first ""date"" at 13 (ie. seeing a movie while his mom and his friends mom tagged along). My oldest two found out and were furious. They're claiming that I ""got permissive"" and are allowing the younger kids to get away with things they would never have been allowed to do. Which I guess is true, but it's not because I got lazy or gave up. It's because I realized that my approach with them was a mistake and now I'm trying to learn from it, which made them more angry that I ""used them as guinea pigs"" and say that I'm favoring the younger kids. We've been arguing all day and now they're dragging my siblings into this and it's a whole thing.",Asshole
AITA? My roommate is complaining that my bf is staying over too often and I think she’s being unreasonable.,"Final edit* I stopped replying to comments because I’m having to repeat the same thing over and over SO - one last time I will say that this has only been going on for the last month and a half (almost month and three weeks). I’ve counted, and it’s been ten times in the past month and half that he has stayed with me. He has only stayed with me three times since March started, only on the weekends. When he comes over, it is always in the evening when we are coming home from bars, after spending the entire day working on his house, and he leaves first thing in the morning to continue working on reno. It might be hard to believe, but we are almost never in shared spaces. Truly almost NEVER. The man really is just there to have a roof over his head while he sleeps. 

Edit** I said he sometimes works from my place on weekdays, but it has been maybe three Fridays, I am always home on those Fridays, because I work part time, and my roommate is not home because she also has a job. 

Edit 2** my boyfriend is pretty much only actually at the apartment at night so that we can sleep; the only real space he is taking up is in my bed.

Edit 3** my roommate, and I have had multiple discussions about my boyfriend staying over a little more frequently at night, and every single time she has maintained that it does not bother her. 

Edit 4** he got this house so we can move in together. He will have floors in his house by the end of March, and will no longer need to stay with us as often. My lease is up in June, and I will move into the house with him.

I (22f) have lived with my roommate (24f) for about two years. My bf (28m) and I have been together since before my roommate and I moved in together. Currently, he lives an hour away from me, a couple towns over. About a month and a half ago, he was able to purchase a house in my town and has been renovating it. As is, it is unlivable. There are no floors in the entire house, so staying there is not an option. It also doesn’t make sense for him to drive the hour back home when I live two minutes from the new house. Today, my roommate texted me and said she wants to have a conversation about how often he’s been staying over. Over the past month and a half, he has stayed over about two nights a week on average. Sometimes three nights, sometimes one. It is almost always during the weekend. He is repairing the house during the day, and we will go out at night or sometimes chill at my place after. Maybe 3-4 times TOTAL during this entire month and a half, he has worked from my apartment (he works from home) on a week day (it’s usually a Friday) but he always works in my room so as to not take up our shared space, such as the kitchen table. I am also always home when he is there. I have my own room and bathroom, so he isn’t taking any of her personal space whatsoever. I will also mention that our utility bills have NOT increased whatsoever during this time - I checked. Who is the a**hole here? Am I wrong to think she’s be unreasonable? This hasn’t ever been a problem during the last two summers for example, where he stayed most weekends after going to the beach and hanging with friends. I don’t see why it’s suddenly an issue now. 

Side note: I go to see him at his place all the time (usually at least once a week) and have complained to my roommate on many occasions that I wish he’d come to me one or two nights a week so I don’t have to drive as much, so I’ve been extremely happy that the new house means he comes to me more. She has always agreed that he should come to me more so I don’t have to drive constantly, and now that he’s doing just that, it’s an issue?!",Asshole
AITA for making an insurance claim against someone just trying to help me?,"I take my dogs for a run every afternoon to some fields about a 10 minute drive from my home. I load them up in the canopy in the back of my ute and pop the one window of canopy into the open position so my dogs can look at things and get some fresh air. The gas struts of the window have failed (meaning the window no longer supports itself while open and drops down) so I wrap a strap around the inner strut to act as support so the window doesnt drop down and close while going over bumps.

I did the same thing that afternoon, but after getting home and dropping the dogs off, I needed to pop into the shops. Problem was I forgot that I had left the canopy window open while driving to the shops. 

On my way there some bloke got out of his car at a set of traffic lights and runs over to my truck and attempts to close the canopy window down for me. But because I braced it so well, he had to put extra force into trying to close it (I watched this all unfold in the mirror - it happened extremely fast so I had no opportunity to tell him to stop). He put so much force into trying to close it for me that he completely shattered the window. The light went green so we pulled over on the other side of the intersection. I got his details from him, he’s 20 years old, driving an old four wheel drive. Really nice kid. 

But am I the asshole for making an insurance claim to have the canopy replaced (it was an older canopy so they could not make repairs). I do feel bad that he was only trying to help out but in the same breath I was left with problem I never created. 

Should I have copped it on the chin? I left the window open mistakenly. He was just trying to be a good samaritan and was extremely apologetic about it. He actually went back and cleaned glass off the road with a broom. He also cut his feet on the glass.

Edit: some people saying im taking advantage of the situation which is not true. I asked insurance to repair the old canopy. The manufacturer came back and said it cant be replaced because the model was no longer supported and had been superseded - so the whole canopy must be replaced under the insurance claim.",Asshole
AITA for calling out my sister for not making her wedding accessibility friendly for FAMILY,"For context, I (34F) am a single mom to my daughter Mia (8F). Mia has been disabled since the day she was born and needs wheelchair assistance and constant care whenever she is awake. I absolutely love her to death and it’s only been us during this entire journey, so I’m definitely super protective of my little girl.

I also have a sister Cassidy (28F) who just called me about the logistics/plan for her wedding in six months to her fiancé Max (27M). She said the wedding was going to be at a beach near our city, and it will completely be held in the sand: basically a 35 person ceremony right by the water followed by a bonfire and barbecue also in the sand. She said she just wanted to let me know before she sent the official invite because of Mia.

I truly have never been more shocked and disappointed in my sister. You would think she would at least check in with me before she reserved the beach space because Mia obviously can’t come. And now she’s only telling me because it’s set in stone and there’s nothing she can change. I tried explaining how hurtful this is to Mia because Mia loves her auntie, but she’ll be absolutely heartbroken not being able to attend the wedding. It’s already so difficult raising a child with disabilities without a partner, but when even family is this inconsiderate and cruel, it’s truly the worst feeling.

Cassidy immediately started deflecting saying her and Max checked to make sure the beach had a sand friendly wheelchair for me to rent ($110/day) … the audacity to ask your guests to be paying just to make it to the event (especially when she knows I cannot afford this). Then she said how she will not change the location because her and Max met on this very beach and it has been their dream ever since to get married here after they also got engaged here.

When I suggested she pay for the rental, she kept saying how her and Max already had to cut so much out of their budget and plans because they also can’t afford much. Like you’re already paying for a whole wedding, but can’t afford a rental for your FAMILY to come? I was talking to some moms of children with disabilities and they all agree that it sounds like Cassidy doesn’t even want Mia there and is using all of this as an excuse. I’m thinking about just telling her that we won’t be attending her wedding and supporting a person who’s inconsiderate to her own family.

AITA for starting my truck?," I work a normal day shift (7-4) and each morning, as it has been below freezing, I remotely start my truck from inside the house to let it warm up before I drive to work.

Apparently my neighbor, from the complaining I have heard through the window, works second shift and the sound of my truck warming up awakens him every morning. He has complained very impolitely about this twice now, I have never met him, and do not know him as I just moved in about 6 months ago. 

My truck does have an aftermarket exhaust on it, but I wouldn’t consider it “loud”, this is the first time anyone has ever complained about it. So…am I an asshole for starting my truck in the morning, and ignoring his complaining?


UPDATE

To answer some of the info requests.  I installed the exhaust because the original needed replaced.  It is more durable and better made than the stock exhaust for about the same price.

My truck is not a diesel, it is a V6.  It is turbocharged, and from my understanding, it is helpful for longevity to warm those up in cold temperatures.  I live in the Midwest, so cold temps are anywhere from single digits to 32°F.  Once they are above freezing I don't use the remote start.

As far as the noise level itself, my truck has a quiet start option which is enabled, this keeps the engine at idle speed instead of revving loudly when the remote start is activated
.
When I looked for a replacement exhaust, I actively tried to avoid excessively loud ones, on a V6 they sound like crap and I didn't want to be obnoxiously loud.

Edit:. Link below is the actual sound of the exhaust.  I had a video of it.

AITA for shutting off the home wifi so that my wife would stop working?,"I (35) have been married to my wife Jen (30) for three years, and before that we dated for six years... she is also 32 weeks (eight months) pregnant with twins. She's my best friend and I absolutely adore her, with one minor flaw, she is a huge workaholic/perfectionist.

While we both have very well-paying jobs, Jen's job is way more stressful and time-demanding. Even though she is brilliant and amazing at what she does, she often works around the clock (on average, 60-hour weeks) at home and in office.

This wasn't a problem before, but about two weeks ago her doctor told her to take a step back from work (i.e., go on leave early) because the stress was starting to cause her a couple of health issues, even though the babies are fine.

However, being the workaholic that she is, she has still been working from her laptop 6-8 hours every day. Which, fine, I understand that she had a couple of cases that she needed to finish. But most days she was so focused on work that she was forgetting to eat meals and falling asleep at her desk.

So, yesterday when I got home, I realized that she had done the same thing again. I woke her up and told her that she needed to go rest in bed. She insisted she was fine and said there was an emergency with a client of hers and she just needed to finalize some things for a coworker.

I asked her just to take a break first and take a nap/eat, but she said that she would once she was done and that it wouldn't take her more than an hour. I told her fine, but no longer than an hour even though I was pretty annoyed.

So, two hours later when she was still working, I became frustrated and unplugged the Wi-Fi and put the cable out of sight. The only purpose of this was to cut her off from work on her laptop because she clearly had no intention of stopping.

Once she realized, she yelled at me, called me an AH, and she said that I was treating her like a child and accused me of being controlling, condescending, and ""borderline abusive.""

I told her that she is being stupid and just to let the coworker that asked for her help to handle it. I said that she was free to use the mobile hotspot on her phone, or figure out the router herself, but otherwise I would plug it back in when I woke up (which I did).

She was so mad that she slept in the guest room and when I went to apologize the next morning for calling her stupid (not for cutting the internet) she said that she can't even look at me. She hasn't said another word to me yet.

I'm starting to feel like I might have been a bit extreme, even if I only did it out of concern. but honestly, overdoing it by trying to meet deadlines that she's not even supposed to be responsible for.

AITA?

*Edit: So, uh yeah… I wrote this thinking it would get 20 comments at most.* 

*Jen and I had a calm discussion about last night, pretty much immediately after I posted.*

*She called me on my shit, told me that I only stressed her out more by cutting the internet (something a lot of people pointed out), and we both decided what we would respond if the other person was acting in a way that was harmful to our family so that we both would feel respected. I apologized for calling her stupid, and she apologized for calling me abusive… as it turns out neither of us meant the name-calling. I promised to trust her judgement, she promised not to overdo it with work. I mentioned that we should go to therapy at least once before the boys are born, and she also thought it was a good idea. We made up, got burgers, and she passed out on the couch.* 

*But I do agree that I was in the wrong here, and I accept my yta judgement. It’s deserved and I’m going to work on myself.*

*Side note: it is horrifying that so many people were able to able to make out exactly what she does from what little I said about her job. (she is a pretty kick-ass attorney tho)*",Asshole
AITA for complimenting a group of female students on their work,"I (37M) work for a small tech company, my local university has a partnership with our company and invite some of us to judge a game jam competition where students have 3 days to make a small game in groups. I was one of the judges.

There were a lot of groups that were mixed gender, some with just guys and 3 groups with only girls. 2 of the girl groups dropped out the first day as they felt they could not get their idea done.

When I passed by the work area of the remaining girl group, I saw that they were making really good progress and I complimented them on their game, said it was looking really good and mentioned that the other girl groups dropped out but it looks like they are surviving. One of the girls got upset at me and said I should not be complimenting their project in a way that implies it is good work for a girl project.

She was visibly cold with me for the rest of the competition and glared at me. And I think she complained to someone because, later I got a message from a manager about making sure I was sensitive about the lack of women in CS.

I still gave their project a good score as it was really good and my 3rd favorite. They ended up winning and my 1st and 2nd pick came 2nd and 4th respectively.

AITA for complimenting their project?

EDIT: Ok I get the point, I will be more careful next time and I kind of get it, however it was not my intent to make her feel that way. I thought I was encouraging them. It never directly said something like good work for a girl.",Asshole
AITA for choosing an adults only hotel for our destination wedding,"TA account. Was originally going to ask about another situation (hence the name) but that resolved. 

I’ll be as succinct as possible. My (newly engaged) fiancée and I are getting married in November in Mexico. We live in NY but I am a second gen immigrant so we picked a destination wedding so my extended family could easily join without visa issues. 

We called today to tell my fiancées brother and sister in law were getting married in Mexico at an adults only hotel. They have two kids - 11 and 4. SIL said she doesn’t have anyone to watch the kids so they can’t come. We understood, but said since it’s March and they have several months maybe they can figure out a plan? She then added her work schedule couldn’t allow it either. My fiancée asked if his brother could still come as he really wanted his family there (besides his brother he only has a grandfather who is coming) and then SIL said it was inconsiderate that we picked a hotel that wouldn’t allow her kids and her husband wouldn’t take a trip internationally without them since they’ve never taken a family trip out of the country. The kids were in the background and could be heard yelling “let’s all go to Mexico I wanna go” Then she abruptly got silent and hung up. 

I feel bad they can’t join, and briefly debated finding a new hotel - but I really like this hotel and we’ve already paid a deposit. AITA for not wanting to change hotels and stick to adults only even if that means my SIL can’t attend? 

**addl note they are legally not married we just refer to her as SIL. She has always wanted to get married at a destination wedding so my fiancée thinks this is another reason she’s being grouchy towards us.

ETA: willing to take constructive feedback but anyone labeling me an AH for a destination wedding - I’m sorry I’m not sorry for that. There’s an entire industry of destination weddings.

I should have added we even offered to add them to the AirBNB that some of my family chose to stay nearby so that the kids could come on vacation. But then it became about them missing out on the all inclusive part 

There was no pestering. We had a five min convo and tried to offer alternatives.",Asshole
AITA for only wanting vegetarian food for my wedding even though my fiancé loves meat?,"I (22F) and my fiancé (24M) are getting married later this year. We come from different cultural backgrounds.. he is a white American Christian and I am South Indian Hindu. We are combining aspects of both our cultures for the wedding and having two ceremonies on the same day with a reception dinner. My fiancé loves meat and tbh I do too.. but South Indian Hindu weddings need to fall on auspicious days and meat is a big no-no. My fiancé thinks our non-Indian guests who are not familiar with the culture will think we are being cheap by doing vegetarian food and not having alcohol (he’s okay with no alcohol though). I disagree since our food will be very nice (traditional South Indian wedding meals have a huge array of dishes that are served endlessly on a banana leaf plate) and we will have Western desserts following the dinner. My fiancé and his parents/brother all enjoy vegetarian Indian food.. so I’m not sure what the problem is. My fiancé thinks we should also include non vegetarian Indian food.. but that would offend my entire family and plainly be sacrilegious. My family eats meat, but like Catholics on Lent fridays, we don’t eat meat on auspicious days like weddings. Am I the asshole for insisting on vegetarian food? Also, any ideas on compromises to suggest?

Edit: I spoke with my fiancé as well as his parents and we decided that it would be best to have vegetarian American options available in addition to the Indian food. And I mentioned this in the comments already but just to reiterate, his family asked for no alcohol first. His parents convinced him that not having meat won’t make us look cheap especially since we are going all out with florals and desserts and entertainment.

Edit 2: I am currently speaking with the owner of our venue and seeing if we can have the venue for 2 days instead of just one. He’s a family friend and will prioritize giving us a reservation if at all possible. If we can have two days, then none of this stuff will be an issue and we can have meat (not beef though) and my family would be fine paying for it on the Christian ceremony day.

Edit 3: since many people want to call me out for saying “my” instead of “our” wedding… let me explain the reasoning behind my choice of pronoun. I am speaking to you (this subreddit) and that is why I say my and not our.. of course if I am in the company of my fiancé I would say our.

AITA for not comforting my daughter after she got hurt,"I know I sound like the AH from the title but let me explain. 

I (m30) have a daughter (f13) I am a single dad and it's always been just her and I. My daughter due to health issues has always dealt with a lot of joint pain which is a difficult thing to deal with at such a young age. And it's really difficult seeing my daughter in chronic pain. 

We are watching my sister’s dog who is a high-energy golden retriever. This morning my daughter was playing with the dog, not just throwing a toy or something but full on like rough housing with the dog.  I seen right away that her doing this wouldn't end well for my daughter. So I warned my daughter that playing with the dog like that probably won't be the best idea and told her she'll probably be in pain later so she better stop. She told me she'll be fine. After that I told her she better stop because I don't see a good outcome happening. She ignored me so I let her rough house with the dog which went on for over an hour.

When my daughter was done I could tell she was feeling some pain already. She didn't complain throughout the day but it was very clear she was in pain specifically a more intense pain after playing with the dog. 

My mom came over to visit and saw my daughter clearly in pain and usually when my daughter is having more difficult days with managing her pain I make sure to make sure she's comfortable and just try to make her feel better. Well today my daughter wasn't willing to tell me she was In pain so I wasn't about to start comforting her if she's trying to act like everything is fine. I explained that to my mom and she got upset and told me I need to grow up and stop being a stubborn AH just cause my daughter didn't listen to me. So AITA?",Asshole
"AITA for making my kids shower ""too often""?","FINAL EDIT (hopefully): some of these comments are nasty and are assuming a lot. No, cold showers, especially when it's hot outside, do not equal abuse. No they don't get dressed when they're still wet. No, i don't force kids with wet hair out the door in the middle of a harsh winter. No, their skin is not falling off. no, we don't have AC so sometimes nights are warm and sticky. Ironically you all use your own personal preferences and biases to to call me me an asshole for using my personal preferences and biases to raise my kids. You can't call me an asshole for ""assuming my kids are carbon copies of myself"" when you're naturally assuming they're somehow carbon copies of you, strangers on the internet that live vastly different lives from us.

Throwaway because I'm paranoid.

So I (31F) have been married to my wife (35F) for two years now. She has 2 kids from her previous relationship (9M and 7F) but their dad isn't in the picture and I consider them my kids and they see me as a parental figure, even though they don't call me mom or anything like that.

Because I work remotely and start work later than my wife, I'm in charge of getting the kids ready in the morning and taking them to school, which can be a hassle. It's usually a fight to get them out of bed which leaves us with barely enough time to get ready and get to school on time. I always enforce they take a shower when they wake up too. That's how I grew up and I feel I just feel more refreshed and actually ready to take on the day.

However, trying to get everything done in the morning has led to a few late drop offs at school to the point where my wife was notified. She asked me what was up and she was confused why the kids had to shower in the morning when they already shower at night. I told her the two showers a day serve different purposes -- a short one for waking up, getting a jumpstart on your day, and a longer one for cleaning up after running around all day -- and it's not unreasonable. it's what i do personally. She says since it's making the kids late to school it is unreasonable. I said then the kids gotta get up earlier, which she was not happy about.

obviously i don't want the kids to be late to school, but part of the issue is these kids don't wanna get up and get started. And we've never been significantly late before, so I dunno anymore.

So AITA for making my kids shower twice a day?

EDIT: I encourage speedy showers, like 5 minutes as a goal. I'm not actively trying to make them late. I'm trying to encourage a good routine. My wife is a bit more laissez-faire on the issue and says would rather let them go to school in their pj's without breakfast if it meant they'd be there on time. I'm trying to have all their needs met and if they're 10 minutes late to school, it's not the end of the world.

2ND EDIT: It doesn't dry out your skin if you shower in cold water. Also moisturizer helps with dry skin. It doesn't take that long to dry off, esp since they don't wash hair or get it wet in mornings. I'm not a pervert nor a hardass. It goes like this: I wake up, say you go take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs for breakfast, and then I go get them something to eat. They have never been bullied for being late. When we are late, I walk with them to the classroom, and it doesn't appear like they're missing instruction. At worst they miss morning recess and the announcements of what they're serving for lunch but they bring lunch from home.

Reluctant 3rd edit: Surprised everyone is concerned about cold showers. We live in a climate that's warm year round so cold showers are the way to go. The place i used to live had solar heated water so on rare cold days all you had was cold water or turn on the electric and wait 2 hours for the water to heat up. of course that's whatever. personal preferences and stuff

UPDATE: i see your comments and accept that i'm wrong. more importantly i want to do what's best for them. it's obviously a cultural thing that not everyone agrees with. i've talked to my wife and we're all deisgning a new morning routine together. again i accept that im wrong. it's difficult being a newer parent.  i understand people's concerns with truancy and CPS but trust me it's not at point yet.",Asshole
AITA for making a set list of rules for a Disney trip?,"Hello, throwaway account since my sisters use reddit.

Every single year, me and 2 my sisters take a girls trip to a random location. 

This year was finally my turn to plan a trip, so I decided to book a trip to Disney world for 10 days.

My sisters were very excited about this trip, and so was I. But the booking process took a while. Plus it was pretty costly.

Well, we are leaving in a week and I have created a set of rules for the trip. For example, no sleeping in past 8 a.m. (rope dropping ), wear sneakers only (due to a lot of walking), etc.

I sent my sisters this list today so they could know what to expect. They didn’t take it too well and said that I was being very overdramatic and that this wasn’t needed. I told them that this definitely was needed to get the best experience out of Disney world. We got into an argument over it and now they are saying they no longer want to go on the trip.

She then went and got her skirt and we took the next bus and I thought that was the end of it.

AITA for not bailing my son out?,"My son Becker (27) talked nonstop about his investment men of a crypto coin called Shiba. He kept trying to get my wife and other family members to invest.

After the new year, I cut off the bank of mom and dad. He’s 27. Things seemed ok until last month , until my wife got a random call, and Becker is in jail for theft. He stole from his friends and roommates because he was once again unemployed and his investments hadn’t worked out.

My wife paid his bail, and I stopped my direct deposit to our joint account.

"AITA for still utilizing my vacation home even though my girlfriend is ""banned""?","My former partner and I own property in Ireland.

And we still co-own a vacation home in a foreign country.

The one rule we made for the property was that new flames aren't allowed to be taken there.

AITA for not seating my brother and his ex wife together at my wedding?,"Throwaway. My (25F) wedding is in a month and I sent out the prospective seating chart to my bridal party which includes my bridesmaids and my immediate family. The bride and groom’s parties are seated at the front at long tables for both the ceremony and reception. It makes things easier since there are a lot of moving parts. The rest of the guests are seated at small circular tables.

My brother Noah (28M) was upset that his ex wife Flora (31F) wasn’t seated with him like the other spouses. 

They got divorced two years ago after Noah said that Flora was an emotionless mannequin who had no time or energy for him. Our family was stunned because Flora always seemed loving though her calmness is sometimes a little too stoic. I think his friends are to blame. My mom loved Flora. About a year ago, Flora had a car accident where she passed out behind the wheel and drove into a tree in her backyard. It turns out she had a disease that affected her heart and her body. It was a miracle that she was even able to function as long as she did. She looked fine if a bit underweight but she was close to death.

Noah and our mom threw themselves into helping Flora. He drives her everywhere, makes all her specialized meals, does the chores, makes the doctors appointments. He really stepped up. They recently got remarried so Flora can be on his health insurance rather than hers, although it’s just a marriage on paper. My mom’s still upset about that. 

I made sure that the venue was aware of Flora’s needs, so she’s seated close to an exit for fresh air, has the right dietary food, and a person there to help her if need be (edit: a CNA/nurse). 
 Flora hasn’t asked for anything. Noah, however, says that he needs to be seated next to her to take care of her needs. I’ve already taken care of Flora’s needs and I don’t want gossip on why they’re sitting together when they’re divorced on my wedding day, so I told him no. He threw a fit and said neither of them would come to the wedding. My mother is begging me to reconsider but she wants them to get back together. AITA?

Edit: most people, including our friends and extended family, don’t know about Flora’s health issues or that Noah’s been taking care of her or that they are legally remarried. Our family and friends are a gossipy bunch and it will definitely be the talk of the party rather than my wedding. 

My mom knows the ins and outs of Flora’s illness and I talked with her on what Flora needed. She is invited as my mother’s and my guest officially

 I sent her a list of what’s I’ve prepared and asked if she needed anything. She just said thanks and she’s excited for the wedding. But to be honest, Flora’s not the one to ask for accommodations anyways which is why I had my mom make sure we covered everything.

Edit2: I admit I’m the a hole and a bit of a bridezilla. I asked Flora if she wanted to sit next to my brother and she said she was fine with the RN (not CNA) and she didn’t want her heart monitor to beep during the wedding. I assured her it was totally okay and after talking it over with her and the RN, we decided she would sit between my mom and my brother but closer to my mom as it made it clear she was invited by my mom. So the order would go my bridesmaids +spouse, my dad, mom, Flora, and Noah. Flora declined a +1 (though I offered) and Noah knows he’s banned from any +1s. 

Flora doesn’t want people to know about the remarriage and honestly I understand. Noah was a nightmare during the divorce. In the later part of their marriage, he would complain that she didn’t love him enough because she didn’t plan enough things on the weekend, she would fall asleep on date nights or at movies, she would take hours to make him a simple cake, she would always be tired, she forgot their first date anniverary, she forgot his favorite things, and she didn’t shower him with enough attention. Noah is a needy person; he need his partner to know that he’s the center of their world like they’re the center of his. Flora was trying SO hard. She supported him through college, got him a better job, would lavish him with attention but the small things got him. She would write notes to herself to remember the things he cared about, she would spend hours making him desserts, she drank so much caffeine to keep herself awake for him. His best friend (who I suspect always had a crush on him) would tell him that she didn’t care if she didn’t do this or remember that or had enough energy and Noah listened.

I told him that Flora was trying and he said trying wasn’t good enough. He blindsided her with a divorce but even after they divorced he needed her emotional support and she helped him. 

Then after the accident we find out Flora’s heart was failing and couldn’t get blood to her brain. She literally was dying and still trying so hard.

He’s acting like a good husband now but he’s not Flora’s husband and I respect that. She didn’t want anyone to know about the remarriage. 

I know he never stopped loving her and was temporarily crazy but I didn’t want my wedding to be a situation where everyone asks if they’re back together and what Flora did to win him back and how my brother might let it slip that they’re remarried. She doesn’t like attention and I frankly think our friends and family will gossip about what she did to “win” him back. Either way, I asked Flora and she confirmed she’s good with the seating.",Asshole
AITA for expecting my bf to pick me up from work during a snow storm?,"Edit for info:
-We live in Southwest Ontario, Canada. He’s been driving for 8 years, his car has winter tires and is in good working condition.

-If I wanted to be put on as a secondary driver I’d have to talk to his dad about it and I’m quite shy when it comes to that

-I work 9-6 as the closer of my classroom at a daycare, no choice to call in due to weather

-The weather apps said “snowfall 5-15 cm” which yes is significant but to Ontario residents is not any indication of needing alternate travel plans

-the storm started at 3pm with 2-4cm per hour and 70-80km/hr winds

-I didn’t dress more weather appropriately because when I left the house at 7am all I knew was that it was going to snow but it was Monday and he’d be there to get me

-He doesn’t get on his game until 10 or 11, after we’ve eaten dinner, watched some tv and spent time together.

-Thanks for the relationship advice, but if I wanted it I would’ve posted on r/relationshipadvice

-His ultimate reason for not coming to get me was safety and not wrecking car because we need it to move in 2 weeks, which leads to the fact that we’re moving to a MUCH closer (8 bus stops) apartment soon and none of this will matter

I didn’t expect this to blow up like this and was really just posting to get my feels out so I didn’t lash out at him because I can see his POV too




Yesterday afternoon/evening we got hit with a wicked storm. Near zero visibility, plows couldn’t get roads cleared fast enough, 20 minute commutes were taking over an hour. 

I have a license but no car, my bf has both. We live together. He doesn’t work (rich dad), just sleeps until 3-4pm and plays video games all night after I go to bed. My work is a 20-25 minute drive, mostly highway. We have an agreement that he picks me up from work on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. I take the bus every morning and I bus home on Tuesdays and Thursdays. When I bus home he has dinner ready for me (just something frozen cooked in the oven). It’s 3 different bus lines, takes about 90 minutes. Uber/cab is between $40 and $60.

I’m not allowed my phone while I’m at work, so I get off at 5:30 to a bunch of texts from him about how Maps is estimating 51 mins for him to get to me and how awful it is out there so he isn’t going to come. I was annoyed, but semi-understanding. He seemed apologetic and kept saying “I hope you don’t hate me”.

I stood in blizzard conditions from 5:45 until 6:20 waiting for my first bus (scheduled to be there at 5:58). My legs were numb and covered in ice pellets (which then melted on the heated bus and made me soaking wet). With each connection I grew more and more irritated until I was nothing short of livid. For my last connection I was in the cold from 7:20 to 8:00. I didn’t get home until 8:30. I ran myself a bubble bath, ate leftover pasta while in the bath and then went to bed. It took everything in me to not lose my shit on him for leaving me to commute in a storm. Even this morning as I left for work and he was snuggled up in bed I had to bite my tongue.

AITA for ruining my nephew’s birthday party?,"I (26F) am the youngest of 5 children and have a close-knit family, but do have a rocky relationship with my SIL. She and my brother have 4 kids together and she definitely wears the pants in the relationship. 

My nephews (they are twins) are turning 9 and my SIL wants to have a family birthday party for them. My family lives relatively close to one another (30 minutes or so) with the exception of my brother and SIL, who live about 2 hours away from all of us. 

My SIL is planning to have the birthday party at her home with just my family, her parents (they live near her), and her sisters family (equal distance between our family and my brother/SIL). After speaking with my mom, I called my SIL and asked if we could relocate the party to my parents house. I am 37 weeks pregnant, will be closer to 39 weeks at the time of the party,  and would feel more comfortable closer to home. Two hours in the car at 39 weeks pregnant is a lot, not to mention feeling nervous about the possibility of going into labor. I told my SIL that my mom (and myself to the best I can) can plan/pay for everything for the party since they would have to make the trip to us- my mom had agreed to this. She could still plan and do whatever she wanted, but the thought was to compromise and take some of the pressure off of her in return of her relocating so I could be there. 

My SIL refuses. She said that it is her kids, her party, and must be done at her house. She said it was selfish and disrespectful of me to even ask. She said that it takes the boys out of their environment, their older girls (12 and 14) would not be able to hang out with friends after the party, and now her parents would have to make the trip too. I tried to reason with her but she wasn’t having it. She said I was ruining my nephew’s party by causing this tension and if I didn’t want to come I didn’t have to. She accused me of using my pregnancy as an excuse to gain control. 

As it stands now, the party is at her house and my husband and I will not be going. I am just not comfortable being that far from home so close to giving birth and clearly she didn’t want to take me up on my offer to make the party easier for her and have all of our family together. She is mad at my mom not too for not telling me that I was being ridiculous. My parents are still going to the party (as they should, but I’m sure my SIL will make it known that she is upset with my mom). 

AITA for asking my sister to relocate my nephew’s birthday so I could attend?

EDIT: I understand all of the YTA comments and am not trying to combat them. I did see some questions on how pushy I was. I think when initially writing the post and saying I tried to reason with her came off as pushy. I just meant that I explained why I was asking. I respect her choice not to move it and understand why. Just to clarify, none of my nephews friends will be at the party (they had a separate friend party planned). I think the background here is also that we have a rocky relationship not because I’m “entitled” but because she is always trying to alienate my brother from his family. She has a rocky relationship with all of my siblings as well as my parents. I don’t expect this to change that I’m TA here but I see a lot of questions in the comments.",Asshole
AITA for telling my son he deserves his broken ankle?,"I have two boys (Nathan and Isaac) and one girl (Gracie) all are great kids and they haven't really caused any big troubles, well behaved.

Recently my middle child Isaac has been really into soccer/football, he tries to get his hands on any round object and try to play with it like it's a ball. He's been getting his siblings into it and it's just been causing problems - if he could play it'd be nice but he's honestly as bad as a cat in water.

Gracie and Nathan have been hyping him up calling him the next Messi and a lot of other stars. Nice, nothing wrong with it.

I have told Isaac to not play with objects that he knows could harm him and he's been listening up until yesterday. He decided it would be ""fucking awesome"" if he could play with my weights and try kicking them like a football.

That went as well as you'd expect. With a broken ankle and a free night at the hospital.

I told Isaac what he did was stupid, and that he deserved this broken ankle and it should teach him a lesson, and that maybe he should let this football/soccer thing die down a bit and find a new hobby until his ankle was healed, he blamed me for not believing in him and wanting to sabotage his career.

My wife thinks that maybe I should have been softer with Isaac but he's not 4, he's 14 and should know what things are stupid and not.

so AITA?

AITA for calling my husband a ‘f’ing A-hole’ in front of our kids?,"Let me preface this story by stating that I am a person living with multiple disabilities which affect my vision, mobility and mental health.  I have been living with these conditions for the past 10 years but the last year has been really hard. 

So last night we went to an event as a family (my husband, two teenagers and I).   It was stormy out (high winds, snow, icy sidewalks).  We had to park maybe 400m away from the venue.  When we walked to the venue it was daylight and the sidewalks were passable.  My husband and kids walked ahead of me.  I was a bit annoyed but I let it go, not wanting to ruin the evening. 

After the event we left.  I turned away from my family for maybe 20 seconds to say good bye to someone who sat with us at the event.  When I turned around my family was halfway to the car.   I was really annoyed.  

I trudged through the dark, snowy weather.  I literally could barely make it to the car because the wind was so strong and the sidewalk was quite icy at this point.  I finally made it to the parking lot and my husband pulled the car out of the parking spot and picked me up probably 10 feet from where we were parked.  

I got in the car and said ‘thanks a lot for waiting for me, fucking asshole’.  My husband acted surprised and said he planned to bring the car around to pick me up.  Hearing is not one of my disabilities and my family never told me this was the plan.  

We had told the kids we’d go to their favourite restaurant afterwards and we drove there in awkward silence.  When we got there my husband acted all sulky, didn’t order food and was staring at his phone.   I looked at him and told him he at least owed me an apology.  He said ‘I’m sorry. It was a misunderstanding’.  My daughter (19f) said I was ruining the night.  

I let it go but I’m still upset by the situation. 

So here I am, prepared for an honest judgment.  AITAH?

ETA:  I accept my judgment that I was the AH.  I just spoke to my husband and apologized.  He conceded that he didn’t communicate well and I told him that I shouldn’t have blown up at him.

I also apologized to the kids.  

I still feel hurt that they took off without saying anything but I completely overreacted and I will do better moving forward.

I did not preface my post in order to garner sympathy.  I was explaining why it was a big deal for me to be left to walk to the car unattended. 

I also did not time how long I spoke to the person we sat with (not a stranger) but I literally said goodbye and asked her to keep in touch.  I didn’t have a full conversation with her.  By the time we finished talking I couldn’t really see my husband and kids so I started walking by myself to the car.  When I got to the parking lot my husband was just pulling out.  

I absolutely agree that my reaction was inappropriate but please don’t make it sound like I’m some horrible person who my family hates.   My children are my life and I have a very good relationship with them.   I had a bad night and I apologized.  I’m not a villain.",Asshole
AITA for telling my sister she was wrong for telling our parents WHY she doesn't want kids?,"I always knew I didn't want to have kids. I don't have any specific reason for not wanting children, I just lack the desire and I strongly believe that the question should be ""why do you want kids?"" instead of ""why don't you want kids?"".

My older sister, Sadie, was very vocal about wanting to have children in her early 20s, but now that she is in her late 20s, she changed her mind.

Our parents never liked that I don't want kids, but they didn't care much about it either, since they knew Sadie will give them grandchildren. But now that Sadie changed her mind, they are panicking.

They invited us both over to dinner, then ""confronted"" us on why we don't want to have children and demanded a reason. I told them I just simply lack the desire and I expected Sadie to do the same, but instead, she threw me under the bus.

She decided to perpetuate the childfree stereotype and said that she is too lazy and selfish to have children. She doesn't want to start her mornings with making breakfast, getting the kids ready and taking them to school, she is just too lazy for that and doesn't want to give up her nice vacations and hobbies.
 
Thanks to her, now our parents are bugging me too and believe I'm a selfish, lazy person. I told Sadie she was wrong for telling our parents that's her reason and she should've thought about me before opening her mouth.

Sadie said she has every right to tell our parents whatever she wants and it's not her fault they are the way they are and that I can't stand up for myself. AITA?

Edit: She called herself lazy and selfish and that's what I have a problem with.

Edit 2: Again: nobody has to give a reason why they don't want kids, so no, there is no such thing as an invalid reason. I don't care what Sadie's reason is, my problem is that she used the words LAZY and SELFISH, which are the absolute worst childfree stereotypes.",Asshole
AITA for referring to my son’s wedding reception as a BBQ?,"My son and his partner, both of whom are in their early 40’s, were married on Friday. They decided to have a very simple courthouse wedding with only a select few close family members in attendance followed by a backyard BBQ reception at their home with more friends and extended family invited. 

Leading up to their event I had misplaced the date a couple times as my phone calendar has been acting up and not syncing with my computer which was the device I had used to input their wedding. Due to this I had a few times accidentally went to make other plans for this weekend before being corrected. Erroneously I responded I had forgotten about their little BBQ get together and I would change my other plans. Again, my phone calendar has not been populating from my computer. Additionally, unlike with my daughters wedding where I was very involved, my son and his partner wanted everything to be understated and simple and so I had no involvement in planning. They have been partners close to twenty years at this point and I consider them basically married for all intents and purposes. 

I am finding, however, now that the event is over, my daughter has told me she didn’t like the way I spoke about the wedding or reception. In particular she did not like that I referred to their party as a BBQ apparently. I find that since their father and I divorced that all the fault lies with me in my children’s eyes. I wasn’t aware of any offense, but my son will never tell me when he is upset and prefers to more or less ignore me half of the time. I’m still not sure what social faux pas I’ve made with the younger crowd this time, perhaps nothing and my family in particular is sensitive. Of course, I will apologize to my son if he took any offense.",Asshole
AITA for Not Making My Sister a Bridesmaid Because of Her Looks?,"Background: I (25F) am a homely looking girl. There is no other way to say it; I am not hot or even pretty by most people's standards. My sister (27F), ""Bella"" is one of the most beautiful women who has ever walked this planet. Like, got stopped on the street and in the mall multiple times while we were growing up for modeling opportunities.

We have different dads, and I guess she just won the genetic lottery. I was jealous of her as a kid, especially because we were always compared to one another. I'm 5'4, average body, slightly below average face. She's 5'11, thin, and all around just really gorgeous.

She's also a genuinely great person. She's humble and sweet, and even though she could've made a living off of her looks, she ended up going into social work and now works with kids in foster care. Her and I are close. We see one another a bit less since she moved to a new city with her husband, but we constantly text and call. I was her maid of honor two years ago at her wedding.

Four months ago my fiancé (30M), Allen, proposed to me and I said yes. My family was excited for me and they all like him. Him and I have been together for just over two years. Bella and Allen are close as well, and we often have them over for dinner or go to their house for game nights.

Now to the issue. I thought about it a lot and decided to not have Bella in my bridal party. I just wanted one day where we weren't standing side-by-side, being compared. I wanted to be the pretty one standing at the alter on my day. I've gotten over my jealousy of her for the most part and accepted myself for how I look and who I am, but the thought of everyone looking at her at my wedding broke my heart.

She obviously thought she would be my maid of honor, and so before I asked anyone to be in my bridal party, I went to her house to talk to her. I didn't want her to hear through the grapevine or social media that she wasn't only not my maid of honor, but not in my bridal party at all. When I went over and told her and explained my reasoning, she started to cry.

She didn't get mad at me, but she said it was really hurtful that I'd exclude her because of the way she looks. I understand her point. Her and I are best friends. She's been giving me a bit of a cold shoulder since this happened, and my parents (both our mom and each of our dads) have called me a major AH for doing this to her, saying she's more upset than she let on but didn't want to taint ""my day"" with drama. She RSVP'd to the wedding invite, so I know she'll still be coming no matter what, but I feel bad that I have excluded her just because of her looks now.

So, AITA?

Edit: Alright, I get in a general sense that people think I am an AH for hurting her feelings and being insecure and selfish. I have been in therapy for family issues and self-image issues since the day I turned 18, but it hasn't 100% sorted itself out yet. I work on it every day. I didn't add this in my original post, but I have a facial deformity because my jaw did not form correctly in the womb, leaving my chin and mouth deformed. My family has never let me forget this part of myself. I have cut most of them out of my life, but the trauma is still there. 

I love my sister, and after talking with Allen, we have decided not to have bride or groom parties at all. I will try to talk to her at some point this weekend and apologize for letting my insecurities get in the way of our relationship and explain that I won't have any MOH or bridesmaids. 

I appreciate those who gave perspective without being cruel, I knew Reddit could be harsh but jeez, some of you need the therapy you so desperately say that I do. ",Asshole
AITA for pointing out how unfair this situation is?,"We(me, my husband, my daughter F15) went to a trip with my in laws. We stayed at a home that belongs to my BIL. It is not a secret to anyone that my BIL favors our niece(F14) who was also there. My BIL was the one who decided who should stay in which room. He gave one of the biggest rooms to the niece and gave one room to me, my husband and daughter to share.

I told my BIL that there is no reason for the niece to have a room all for herself. Let her share it with my daughter but he didn't accept.

So I told him to at least let us have her room and give our room to her because her room is bigger than ours. He said no again because apparently it's the coolest room in the house and niece loves  her room to be very cool when she sleeps.

AITA for telling my sister the reason why she doesn't look like me or my brother is because she's not one of us?,"I'm (17M) the middle child in the family of 3, I have one elder brother Adam (23M) and one younger sister Bella (6F).

My parents (both 48) only had my sister a few years ago via surrogacy because they wanted another child and some other reasons, while my mum and dad did try to have Bella themselves their attempts failed multiple times, because Bella was born via surrogacy she looks different from me and my brother of course.

Now, Bella's teacher had assigned a task where they'd have to write about their family and make a family tree of some sorts.

My mom was very excited to do a task like this and she got out our family photo album out and began showing Bella photos's of our aunts and uncles and other relatives, bella's very curious so she began to notice the differences between her and our relatives I guess because she asked why she looked different from me and Adam and everyone else in our family.

Most of my family is pale with mostly light brown hair, Bella's got tan skin with almost black hair, so yeah she does look different.

I just told her ""you're not fully one of us"", no malice intent or anything just the truth, she isn't really like us in the sense of DNA and other things.

I guess this news made her upset because she kinda started crying like crazy on the spot and my mum just shot me like a dirty look, like she wanted to skin me alive or something.

It took quite a while of reassurance for Bella to understand that being different wasn't anything bad and that she was still her child regardless.

I got a call from my older brother saying I was being a total asshole and that I was ridiculous for saying such a thing to a 6 year old and that I should be ashamed of us.

It was just something I said, i mean it when I say there was no bad intention behind it - Bella was bound to know in the future anyway so what was the harm of telling her now?

AITA for not inviting my unsupportive sister to my wedding?,"I (24 F) got engaged to Derrick (30 M) one month ago. Prior to that, we had known each other for six months. I know that’s not a long time, but when you know, you know. We are madly in love and ready to commit ourselves to each other fully. 

My sister (26 F) has a problem with that though. She was supportive of my relationship with Derrick before we got engaged. When I sent her a text telling her we were engaged, she responded by saying “congratulations.” But then when I saw her the week after that, she got all serious and said I should strongly consider the marriage. 

She told me I was young and could meet people I loved more. That was offensive to me because I love Derrick more than anything, and she’s basically saying my love isn’t that important. She also told me that Derrick and I could date for longer before we got married. But we are already fully committed to each other, so we might as well get married and be recognized as soul mates in the eyes of the law. 

Anyway, the conversation was so hurtful to me. I eventually asked her, very directly, “do you support me marrying Derrick?” She said no. So I stood up, told her she shouldn’t be at the wedding if she didn’t want us to get married, and left. I haven’t talked to her since, although she has texted me multiple times asking to talk. 

Derrick and I were working on the wedding guest list yesterday, and we both agreed my sister should not come if she doesn’t support us. So we are planning not to invite her.

AITA for telling a morbid joke about my son?,"Asking here because I don't feel comfortable discussing this with family or friends right now.

My wife and I have four boys - 17, 15, 13, and 10. We lost our 15 year old in an accident last October and grieving has truly been a process. My wife and I have very different styles of grieving. I really like to talk about my son and what happened to him, but she wants to process things by herself and doesn't want to talk about it. We still have a very close marriage, we just talk about everything other than our son.

My wife was out with friends today and when she got home a few hours ago, she asked me where the boys were. I told her, ""(Oldest) is with a friend, (13 yr. old) is out in the yard, (10 yr. old) is in the basement, and (15 yr. old) should be right where we left him.""

Immediately, she said I was fucked up for saying that. I told her that I cope with humor and clearly, she doesn't. I respect what she does, but she's got to respect what I do. She called me a ""fucking pig"" for joking about our son like that and said she was taking the boys out for dinner. While they were out, she texted me to say that she's really horrified with how ""callous"" I am about the death of our son, saying she was genuinely concerned I might be a sociopath. 

When she got home, she went straight to bed. I tried to sit with her and she told me not to touch her. Our oldest asked me why their mom was in such a bad mood and when I told him, he laughed at the joke.

AITA For expressing my impatience to a family while they held the elevator doors for their Grandma.,"Throwaway acct. So I'm on vacation at a resort in FL.  I leave my room on the 5th floor, and get on the elevator heading to the lobby.  The elevator stops on 3 and a family of 5 steps on.  

The girl stands in the doorway with her hands on her hips.  I make eye contact with the father then the mother then the girl.  10 seconds pass.  I look at them again with a puzzled expression. The girl says, ""We're waiting for Grandma!"".  

5 more seconds pass. So I say, ""The elevators are really fast here. (& They are) You don't have to hold the elevator."". The mother says ""We all want to ride with Grandma"".   A few more seconds pass ( maybe 20 from start to finish) and grandma gets on the elevator.  

She looks at me (we are of the same ethnicity) and asks if I am part of some organization staying in the hotel.  I said I was not. Then the father says, ""He definitely isn't one of them, those people are nice..."".  I said ""I'm just in a hurry and a bit impatient.""

AITA for skipping study group when a kid is there?,"I'm (20f) a student at a community college. I have math 3 days a week and after class a group of us grabs lunch and coffee and sits down in the library to do homework together. Honestly it's just as much a social thing as it is academic and it's a lot of fun. 

A month into the semester, a 10 year old girl joined the class. She's a genius and apparently high school math was too easy for her so she's taking math and biology here. As smart as she is, she's still a little kid. She has a princess backpack and lunchbox and her backpack has more toys than books.

Her nanny was constantly late to pick her up and she can't check herself into the campus daycare so someone invited her to join the study group. I'm not a kid person. Being in the same class as one is weird enough but I'm not going to get coffee (or in her case, a juice box) and hang out with one. 

I went to study group when she was there once and it was just weird. The whole mood is different. She joins the group on Mondays and Wednesdays so I said that I have to work early on those days and do homework at home. Then on Fridays I joined the group and it's like the baby genius doesn't exist. 

Then on Friday she asked if she could join us. Her nanny called in sick so she had to wait on campus until her mom could pick her up. The group said yes so I started to leave. Someone asked where I was going so I said I got called in to work early. Well, that made them figure it out and I got texts from half the group asking if I'm seriously skipping the group because there's a kid there and all calling me immature and saying I hurt baby genius's feelings by not wanting to go to group when she's there.

To give some backstory, my ex (33M) and I (32F) were together almost 11 years before we divorced just over two years ago. While it was an amicable divorce, I think it was hard on both us.

My current boyfriend and I started dating around 6 months after I divorced, and have been going steady ever since.

Now to my former MIL. She was a wonderful person. She always treated me kindly and we got along well. After my ex and I split, there wasn’t any contact, but I don’t fault her for focusing on her son rather than me, just something that happens when families split.

Unfortunately, she passed away due to some ongoing health issues recently. While I hadn’t spoken to her in quite some time, it really affected me, and I’d be lying if I say I didn’t cry. She was in my life for 11 years, and she is someone I will never forget.

Her funeral was slated in my exes hometown, and myself and my family cleared it with exes family that we would be ok to attend. 

I was nervous about attending, and knew I was going to be a mess of emotions at the funeral, so I asked my boyfriend if he would attend to help support me, and he said he would.

The day of the funeral arrived and while I wasn’t expecting anyone to be crazy nice, the response I got was a bit more…mean? As soon as I arrived with my boyfriend, we got some glares from both my exes family, and some of my former friends that still keep in contact with my ex.

We were in the main room waiting to go into the service with my family, when a friend of my ex came over and bluntly told me that my boyfriend was not welcome, and he needed to leave. I was taken aback by this, but honestly, I didn’t want to take away from the funeral and cause a scene. We left and the rest of my family stayed.

I got a text later that night from another former friend telling me it was extremely rude to bring my bf to the funeral. I didn’t respond, but I guess I thought that after almost 2 years of being separated, it wouldn’t be such a big deal…AITA?",Asshole
AITA for not taking my wife's possible abortion seriously?,"EDIT: The word is miscarriage, my bad, english is not my first language!

Edit 2: Thanks to everyone for your insightful comments. Due to the quick reaction of this sub, I was able to apologise quickly and effectively. I told her I was deeply in the wrong, and now we're good again, and she is sharing her emotions and thoughts with me. I'm being more supportive. I don't fully understand it, and I can't help that, but I don't have to understand it, I just have to behave appropriately. Thanks everyone. I accept the AH verdict.

Throwaway for obvious reasons.

My wife (F28) is approx. 6 weeks pregnant with our second child. We had our first child 3 years ago with no issues whatsoever after about a month of trying to become pregnant.

This second pregnancy has also been without issues related to conceiving, as she became pregnant less than two months after we stopped using protection.

Today, she called me (M29) during the day because she is bleeding, and it could be an involuntary abortion. She is very upset, and I told her not to stress about it. If it's a miscarriage, then it's a miscarriage. I told her to call the doctor's office and to rest and take it easy – maybe it's not even bad news? I know it's perfectly natural to have an involuntary abortion before week 12, and we both know that we generally don't have a problem conceiving. If we were unlucky this time, it's okay, it's not a disaster, we will just try again? My wife didn't like this reaction at all. She was upset by my reaction and hung up on me.

I'm currently studying for the bar exam, which I'm taking later this week, and I'm using most of the week with my study group.

I picked up our daughter from daycare at the end of the workday and came home, and my wife is angry with me for not taking her miscarriage seriously enough.

I told her I'm really sorry, and that I understand that it's not easy to go through. I'm trying to comfort her, but she won't let me be a part of it, because she says I don't care.

I do care, but I'm also stressed out about the bar exam, and I know it's perfectly natural to have a miscarriage. I'm not stressed that we will have any trouble becoming pregnant again.

Of course the situation makes me sad, but I accept reality, and at the same time I'm stressed the fuck out with other obligations. I want to comfort her within reason, and now she won't let me.",Asshole
"AITA for ""making"" my 17yo miss her therapy appointment to clean her closet","My daughters (17f) closet is an absolute pigsty, you can't even see the floor it's nearly knee deep in stuff. I have been after her for WEEKS to clean it up and she keeps saying ""I'll do it later"". 

I had ENOUGH and told her she cannot go out with friends or her boyfriend until her closet is clean. 

Unfortunately that week she had work and prior commitments at school so only had one free afternoon where she was going to see her therapist (she is in therapy for depression and anxiety). She also was going to go to with her boyfriend's family on a day trip that following weekend. I figured missing that would finally get through to her to get it done after several weeks of constantly putting it off. 

Instead she cancelled her therapy appointment (as it was her only free afternoon) because she didn't want to miss going with her boyfriend this weekend. Her therapist said I was wrong to do this because she needs her therapy and this was a ""dumb hill to die on"" I told her she's been putting this off for weeks and won't listen and I don't know how else to get through to her. I refuse to live like slobs! 

AITA?

EDIT: I didn't tell her ""cancel therapy to clean your closet"" I said ""if you want to go out with your boyfriend or anyone this week closet needs to be clean before then."" I told her how she budgets her time is up to her, just get it done. 

She chose to cancel the appointment to get it done.",Asshole
AITA for ignoring my cousin congratulating me on my pregnancy?,"I (25F) recently found out that I'm pregnant. The only people who know are my husband, mom, brothers, and my husband's family. I have a cousin (23F) who I haven't seen in about 10 years as she lives in Belgium and I live in the US. From time to time, she reaches out to me. A couple of days ago, my cousin texted me and congratulated me on my pregnancy, and I was really shocked how she knew. I didn't want any of my extended family to know yet. I told her it was such a random thing for her to say, and I brushed it off. She had said that her mom (my aunt) had told her, and she just wanted to give her congrats. I told her I wasn't pregnant, and she started apologizing, saying it was probably a miscommunication. I just left her on read. Then she texted me again saying, it was my mom who told her mom, and now she's confused."" I told her it would've been better she didn't ask me at all and that I would've wanted to announce it instead on social media. I deleted the chat, and she just left me on read.

AITA for being uncomfortable around my girlfriend’s sister and her girlfriend?,"I (33M) have been dating my girlfriend Han (31F) for just over a year. Han has a younger sister Ce (27F) who she’s extremely close to. Ce & I get along really well. I’d never met Ce’s girlfriend but my girlfriend and her are also pretty close. 

Han and Ce’s parents were extremely homophobic growing up and kicked Ce out when she was 16 when they discovered she had kissed a girl. As such, neither of them had a relationship with their parents for the past 9 years. However, in the past year their parents have demonstrated real growth and have gone out of their way to try and repair some of the damage that they caused. They made an active effort to get to know Ce and her girlfriend El (26F). It was Ce & El’s 4 year anniversary last week, and Ce also just got accepted to do a PhD at Harvard.

To celebrate both occasions, they threw a family gathering to celebrate Ce & El’s anniversary and the PhD. They invited many family members and friends. This was the first time I met El. Understandably, Ce told Han & I she was nervous about being in a big group with El and being so public in front of their parents. Throughout the night, Ce & El were very close and they displayed an unexpected amount of PDA: hand holding sometimes, occasional hand on back. PDA makes me extremely uncomfortable when anyone does it and it was unnerving. Towards the end of the nigh Han’s father made a speech about how proud they are that their daughter is who she is now and made something of herself despite the irreparable damage they caused when she was young. It was emotional, and El held Ce in a hug because it made her cry for an extended period. It made me so uncomfortable I had to leave the room.

Han says it was extremely homophobic and that other couples had displayed PDA. She’s asked me not to call her until I’ve had a think about if I’m really ok with Ce. It’s not because she’s gay, I just really hate PDA and spent more time with her than any other couple. AITA?",Asshole
"AITA for screaming at my pregnant fiance for not helping me find my dog, who had run off?","My fiance (28f) is currently 5 months pregnant and has been both fatigued and nauseous lately. I get why she didn't want to help me look for the dog but I can't get over the lack of empathy and bordering selfish behavior of this either. 

My dog (6yo Heeler/Corgi mix) runs off at least once a week. Usually my fiance will help me find her but it's not without protest. I honestly didn't even know how she was getting out of our fenced yard so I installed cameras and found that she was scaling the 8ft fence. I ended up attaching ""spinners"" to the top of the fence thinking that would solve the issue but it didn't. I brought her out today and was playing with her when my phone rang. I was inside just long enough to grab my phone and my dog had gotten out.  I immediately went in search for her, thinking she couldn't have gotten far but I couldn't find her anywhere so I went back to the house and asked my fiance, who was curled up on the sofa, to come help me. She immediately said no. She said she was tired of chasing the dog, that she isn't dealing with it anymore and that I should have been out there watching her. I explained to her that I had been watching her and simply stepped away for point two seconds to grab my phone just inside the sliding door and she had escaped. She again said it wasn't her problem and she's not exhausting herself anymore to search for my dog. I won't even say it was unexpected because as I said, in the past she has always had a problem with helping me search but she's never said no. She just complained about it. 

At first I went and searched myself. After maybe a half hour I came back and asked her again to come help me and she snapped ""I said no! I am so tired of chasing that dog around multiple times a week when I'm already exhausted and throwing up constantly."" I was panicked and unleashed some yelling, which involved me telling her she was a bitch who lacked empathy and that I was thoroughly disappointed with my decision to be with someone so heartless. It was out of pure fear and panic on my part and I did apologize later, after I found my dog, but she said ""Go fuck yourself"" and won't talk to me. AITA? Everyone is on my side except my sister, who says I'm a ""fucking prick"" because it's not my pregnant fiance's responsibility to ""chase around your fucking mutt"" and said she would have left immediately if her BF ever said what I did to her.",Asshole
AITA for not celebrating my 3yo son's birthday?,"My girlfriend and I have a 3yo who is a good kid. My girlfriend liked to host parties, and when he reached his first birthday, she wanted to have a big birthday party, but I managed to convince her to massively downsize to just us, our parents and siblings, and just have some cake, little guy was still too young.

The next year she again talked about her plans to have a big party for our 2yo, but again I told her it would be just close family and a cake and a happy birthday song.

This year she told me about her plans and again I told her to just do something small, but this time she was frustrated and told me to let her do something bigger for our son for once. I explained that it is ridiculous to have such big parties for toddlers, they will not remember anything. For example, when I was 2, my family threw me a huge birthday party, the theme was Toy Story, which had just come out. I have no recollection of it, just some VHS tapes of me looking stupid in a Woody costume while the older kids had fun on their own.

She said it doesn't matter because there will be lots of people taking pictures and he can just see them when he gets older. I told her again that it would just be having fun at his expense, the little guy is a heavy sleeper who plays and runs for 30 minutes and then falls asleep on a sofa or a chair or his bed.

She still doesn't understand my point of view, it's not like he won't ever have a birthday party, we should just wait until he's like 6 or 7, you know, when he can actually remember.

My girlfriend is still mad at me and says she is going to plan a birthday party whether I like it or not. I tried talking to her mom to see if she could talk some sense into her, only to be verbally slammed by her, telling me I'm depriving my child of a childhood. My mom says I should just do what my girlfriend says because Dad's word is not that important and I should know my place as a father.

I feel like I'm going crazy over this. Am I the asshole?

&#x200B;

Edit: Ok, I see that you think I'm the asshole, I see, ok? But NONE of you understand what my point is.

All of you say that birthday parties should be done anyway because the other people will remember. That's what I say in the post. Its an excuse for adults to have a party at the expense of the toddler who wont remember it. It's a selfish reason. Those who compared it to a funeral, is NOT the same thing, funerals are necessary for the soul of the deceased to rest in peace. Nobody wants to go to a funeral, those are not made for selfish reasons.

I don't know if I should believe those who say can remember things as young as 2 or 3 yo. Fake memories are a thing, and holes in the memory can be filled by what other people tell you or pictures or videos. I can't be sure I have a 100% real memory before I was 7 yo. 

Those who call me a bad parent please knock it off, I play with my son, we spend time together, we go to the park etc. My son has a childhood, I just think we should save the bigger events for a time when he is old enough to remember it and fully enjoy it.

But this year I'll let my girlfriend have the party anyway, the birthday is in one week from now and I already told her to do whatever she wants. I'll just stay out of it and just be present at the party. I hope she realized in the future how pointless it is to throw parties for toddlers.",Asshole
AITA for refusing to go out and celebrate my stepson's ‘first words’?,"My (36 M) wife, Fran (35 F), and I have been married for four years. We have a beautiful home and a healthy daughter (3F) and we’re doing amazing. Also, my wife has a son, Nick (17 M). His father is out of the picture, never really was, so Nick has been part of our family since the beginning, without distinction to our daughter.

Nick is on the spectrum; he’s non-verbal, (or non-speaking, as my wife says), but he has always been great at communicating effectively with Fran, and he’s doing better every day. To my understanding (i.e., what my wife tells me) Nick is able to communicate via his phone and his AAC communication device, but he is still considered non-verbal because he has considerable difficulties with verbalization.

Well, it turns out that, a week ago, Nick said his first fully formed ""words."" He mumbled something along the lines of ‘I-love-you’.

That’s great, and I’m incredibly happy about it. The issue is that my wife, who was overflowing with joy, wanted to celebrate that very same week and go out and have a fancy dinner with us, her sister, and her mother. It was a Friday night, and honestly, I didn’t feel like going out and I wasn't in the mood to celebrate, but I said ""Okay, sure, let’s go"" to please my wife.

However, Fran thought I was in a bad mood, and she kept teasing me about being grumpy, so I teased her with ""Well, we didn’t celebrate our daughter’s first words , did we?"" and that started a big argument. After that, I decided not to go out to ‘celebrate’ Nick's mumbled words, and I stayed home. My wife was visibly upset, and the fight escalated on both sides. I pointed out who paid half of Nick’s expenses, and she pointed out that she raised him by herself for more than a decade. We both said stupid things\*\*. To be clear:\*\* I didn’t say the celebration was stupid or unnecessary, I just pointed out it was unusual and not a traditional thing people celebrate.

That’s it. I think she was drowning in a glass of water, and the situation was stupid and escalated out of nowhere. It’s not THAT crazy to not want to go out and ‘celebrate’, isn't it? Needless to say, her entire family thinks I’m the AH.  *TA acc.  I don’t want to make this a big deal.*

**Edit:** People read a <3000 character post and think they know your entire life. Jesus.I misspoke three times. **1.** ‘Non-speaking’ is the correct term **2.** When I said ""what my wife tells me"" I meant the definition of non-speaking and why Nick was diagnosed that way. Of course, I communicate with Nick on a daily basis, I’ve been in his life since he’s 12, I love and support the kiddo. We’ve shared a home for 4 years and he’s my stepson ffs **3.** When I said ‘mumbled his words’ I didn’t mean it in a derogatory way, just wanted to be clear that they weren’t super clear words.

**Edit 2: Did Nick want to go out that night?** Yes. Nick always gets excited to spend time with his aunt and grandma. He was happy and in a great mood that day. **Why was I in a bad mood?** I had a rough week, truly a hard week, and Friday nights are usually my time to get some rest. It was a bad day/week for me, and I said the wrong things. I don’t hate my stepson. Nick is my son, Nick is our son, I was making a distinction to make the context clear. When I introduce my family I don’t even mention he’s my stepson, I introduce Nick as OUR son. 

**To be crystal clear: I'm proud of Nick and his achievements**. I do believe it’s worth celebrating; I just didn’t feel in the mood to do so that day. If that makes me an AH I’m okay with it, but don’t fuckin pretend you know me or my family or that know what I’ve done to support them. I love my family. Point blank period. ",Asshole
AITA for wanting my wife to contribute towards household expenses proportionally,"When my wife and I married, we had decided that she would be a SAHM. She is Russian and has gone no contact with her family since around the time we got married since they are alcoholics. She came here as a student. We have a 5 year old daughter.

Our arrangement was that I gave her an allowance for buying anything she wanted for herself and then I paid for other expenses that we both agree on. I make more than enough for all of us.

It has always been a point of contention and she wanted me to increase her allowance. Sometimes when we disagree on a purchase like a toy for our daughter, she will use her allowance to get it then expect me to reimburse her allowance for it. Additionally she wants to buy expensive makeup and use it even for just going out to see friends casually.

Recently since our daughter started school, she has started doing a few gig jobs like dog walking. I was not for it but I can't stop her from doing what she wants. However the time she spends doing that, means that she has less time to be a SAHM, so I told her recently that I expect her to pay for the house expenses proportionally to what she earns. She disagreed and I said I could just reduce her allowance in that case as she now earns. She got quite angry with me and we fought, things seem better now but sometimes I feel she is still a little upset. She used some minor things against me like the few times I asked her for money as I did not have change for small purchases.

Was I the AH here? I think it is only fair to change the arrangement now that she works.

EDIT: I get it I am an AH. I know I have controlling restrictions on her. We rushed into marriage for her visa issues as she could not find a job and hence married me. I always intended to lessen them once I trusted her and I realize I really do. My dad insisted I be careful because of what people say about Russian brides. She has an Ivy degree in physics and I know her dream is to be in science, I will talk to her if she still wants to get a masters or try getting jobs again now that she has permanent residence. And I will tell her to just use the shared account for any expenses as long as it is not like a $1000 expense.",Asshole

AITA for asking a disabled person to move seats on the bus for my child?,"I (32F) was on the bus with my 5-year-old daughter when we got on at a busy stop. There were no empty seats available, except for one near a person using a wheelchair (40M). I asked the person if they could move their wheelchair to another spot so that my daughter and I could sit together, but the person declined, saying that they needed the space for their mobility device.

I was taken aback and frustrated by this response. I explained to them that my daughter was very young and needed to sit next to me for safety reasons, but they still refused to move. I ended up having to stand for the entire ride with my daughter in tow, which was uncomfortable and tiring for both of us.

When I told a friend about what happened, they said I was being insensitive and ableist. They pointed out that the person in the wheelchair had a right to the space they needed and that it was unfair of me to ask them to move.

We’re very open with each other so I didn’t think she’d take it so offensively.

Now that the baby is coming we need more space unfortunately we can't afford a new home. I brought up to my husband asking Step-daughter to move out. My reasoning is that we really need her room for the new baby and she is an adult with a full time job so it is time for her to be on her own anyway.

My husband agreed and we brought it up to her at dinner one night. We told her we would help with her first 2 months rent. I told her it would be fun her and I could go shopping and I will help her decorate her new apartment. We tried to be as gentle as we could but she was very quiet. 

Privately she told my husband that even though she as a full time job she cannot afford to live on her own. My husband told her she did not need to move out so now we are scrambling trying to find space for new baby.

 A few stops after a pregnant woman  got in, she ignored the first seats (which are the priority seats) and came up to me and asked if I could give her the seat.

AITA for suggesting my stepson (16M) moves out?,"My husband and I have 6 children total and live in 4 bedroom house. We have two sons together (8 & 6), I have a son from a previous relationship (15), and I have 3 step children (20F, 16M & 16F). We live in a 4 bedroom house and for most the time we lived there we had 2 kids per room with the youngest boys sharing, the older boys sharing and the girls sharing. 

Things changed a couple years ago. My oldest stepdaughter finished school and is attending university locally. The girls decided at this point that instead of sharing a bedroom at their dads and sharing a bedroom at their mums, they would each take 1 room as their permanent bedroom. So the 16 yr old lives with us full time and the 20 yr old lives with her mum full time. They both visit the other parents house regularly. 

My 16 yr old stepson has his own bedroom at his mum's house but still splits time between each parents house mostly 50/50. My son lives full time with us as he doesn't have much of a relationship with his dad. My son and stepson do not get on that well and they can often be heard screaming at each other in their bedroom. 

Recently, I asked my stepson why he doesn't move to live full time with his mum so he and my son can have a similar arrangement as their sisters. This way both of the boys would have their own rooms. He would obviously still visit like his older sister does and we could figure something out like a futon instead of a bed in their room so my son has more space when stepson's not there. 

My stepson overreacted to my suggestion and is trying to make out like I'm kicking him out, when really I'm just thinking of a better use of space. It's unfair that all the older kids but my son have their own rooms at one of their parents house. My son likes the idea and has brought it up to his stepbrother a few more times since I originally suggested it and it has caused arguments between them. He now seems to be considering it. 

My husband is angry with me for suggesting his son moving permanently to his mums. He thinks that he and his son would have a less close relationship if this happens (my husband favours his oldest son over our boys). He also thinks I'm making his son feel like he's being forced out. However, it was his daughters already doing the same thing that gave me the idea because it worked out well for them and they both seem happier. I'm also not forcing this to happen I was just suggesting it to him, it would be completely up to him. Is this a good plan or AITA for bringing it up?",Asshole
AITA for not giving up my seat on the bus to my girlfriend.,"My girlfriend (27F) and I (26M) went out for a special event and we were both very dressed up.

It was in another city and we don't have a car so we took the bus there.

On the way back we realized we had some unexpected errands to do in the other city and we spent a good hour walking around. The city is hilly with older cobble stone paths and this was quite tiring for me as I'm not the most fit. 

When we caught the bus to go home, I entered the bus first and took the last available seat and my gf stood next to me.

When the bus started moving she asked if she could take my seat as her feet were tired and I declined as I was tired and quite breathless still.

When we got home she said I was being inconsiderate since she was in heels. I didn't really think that's relavant since she almost always wears heels but she said those were stilettos and she normally wears block heels but I don't really know the difference and I didn't think it mattered for standing, maybe for walking.

She is more fit and goes to the gym and has more stamina and it was just her feet that were tired so I feel I deserved the seat more. Besides it was her choice to wear the shoes.

AITA here since I was actually tired and got to the seat first?",Asshole
AITA for making our daughter (17f) clean our horse's stalls against her will?,"We recently got 2 horses. My younger daughter (13f) wanted them as she's been learning to ride. 

My older daughter (17f) was against them, she's much more ""princessy"" and didn't want to deal with the mess and chores that come with horses, but we told her it wouldn't be something she'd have to deal with and that her younger sister promised to take care of all of it.

Well, recently the older daughter has been disrespectful at home and staying out too late, and her grades have been slipping. 

We warned her to shape up, but last week when we heard that she'd been needlessly insulting to her younger sister while I was our running errands, I told her that she'd be cleaning out the stable each day for the next week as punishment, and that her sister would get a break.

She got really upset and offended, and said we promised she'd never have to go in there or have to scoop horse poop. I said I promised it wouldn't be one of your chores, of course, but obviously a punishment is supposed to be something outside of your normal chores and something you won't like, and I thought it was perfectly fair here.

She's been doing it three days now but seems to be very resentful of our ""broken promise,"" acting very disgusted, and keeps begging to get out of the rest of it. But I said I thought it's very fair and that she's overreacting.

AITA?

AITA for not going out to drive my husband home when he got too drunk?,"This happened several days ago and he's still put out over it, so I don't know how to feel.
My husband went out with a few friends of his friends, which he does just fine all the time. 
It was late, and I worked the next day, so I laid down.
At almost 11, I get woken up by a call from him, totally smashed. After about five minutes of rambling, he says his friends left him somewhere and he needed a ride home. He was barely coherent and couldn't even tell me where he was, and I was tired and pissed off, so I told him he needed to find his friends and figure it out and I went back to sleep.
I don't know when he ended up getting home, he was asleep on the couch when I left. 
Since then he's been short and distant, obviously still upset over it. He didn't tell me about what happened and has slept in the living room since. Gets testy if I even ask.

Maybe it was mean not to go get him, but he's an adult and it shouldn't be my responsibility if he gets too drunk and wonders off somewhere. I want to mention his friends were driving, so I wasn't forcing him to drive home drunk. I figured if he'd really been in trouble, he'd have mentioned it or called back. I didn't think it was that big of a deal, but almost a week later he's still upset. Am I wrong?",Asshole

WIBTA if I snitch on a coworker for keeping a tip?,"I (21 M) work at a restaurant that had Easter brunch today. For brunch, tips were pooled and split. That’s the way this place has always done it. The people involved in this are Maria (20 F) and George (21 M). I’ll try to be short and to the point. 

Maria, George and I are like a little friend group at work since we all went to the same high school and know a lot of the same people. We joke around and have each others backs more so than some of the others we don’t know as well. That’s why I’m posting here and second guessing this. 

Maria’s boyfriends family came in for brunch. She was given a large cash tip from them. They gave her the cash so she could pocket it. Her George and I were all talking in the back when she told us about this and said to keep quiet while assuming we would because of our friendship. 

I spoke to George privately and told him that I think Maria is wrong for keeping the tip all to herself and that I find it to be like stealing from the res of us. I told him that I was thinking about confronting Maria about this and if she refuses to hand in the cash than I will tell a manager. 

George told me that I would be an asshole. He said it was her boyfriends family so it’s a little different. He also said I’m being naive if I really think nobody else kept any cash tips. He told me that the family wanted the money to go to her explicitly and that is okay because it’s their money. It’s also her boyfriend and lot just some strangers. I still can’t help but feel like The rest of us are being cheated here so I am debating doing what I said above. And that is confronting Maria and telling a manager if she refuses to hand in the money.",Asshole
AITA for not letting my sister believe that she can talk to a bird?,"My (16, M) family has a pet parrot. They are all pretty much obsessed with him and my younger and older sisters both keep buying him toys, new food, making him new fruit and vegetable mixes to try out etc. My parents also pay a lot of attention to him and even set up the extra room we have for his cage so he can sleep better at night. He has been with us for a few months now and my family's obsession still hasn't died down.

I've been mostly indifferent since I'm not the biggest fan of animals and my parents keep him away from my room. Luckily for me it seems like he doesn't like me anyways so it's even easier to avoid him flying to my shoulder or anything like that. 

The problem though is that today my sister Emma (10,F) was talking quietly to that bird. She was holding him and saying things like ""You know I love you right?"" and kissing him on the head while the parrot would just mimic the sound. It went on for a while and she repeated that enough that it seemed like she was looking for a response so I told her ""You know he doesn't understand you right"". 

After I said that she just looked at me and made a sour face and ignored me. I didn't want her to actually believe this bird can understand what she is saying since she watches a lot of Disney movies so I feel like they could have given her the wrong idea. I gently explained to her that it's just a bird and that he doesn't understand things like we do. She told me to stop bothering her and ended up leaving the room and told my mom about it.

My mom told me she believed it was harmless for my sister to talk to her pet and that the bird ""reciprocated her feelings"". So I told her that this will harm my sister's way of thinking and get her bullied at school. She told me to drop it and not get involved anymore. AITA?

"AITA for "" moaning ""","I need to know if IATA  or if this is a hill I should die on. 

My (34M) wife's (34F Anna) always bragging about what a great baker her grandmother, Edna, is. She used to own an award winning bakery. We were at my wife late aunt Helen's wake. It was a small gathering, Edna brought along what was apparently Helens favourite pie that Edna made. It was a chocolate pie. Anna offered me a slice and I turned it down, as I am not a fan of such food, however Anna insisted and Edna chimed in. I politely accepted a slice. Turns out Edna makes the best chocolate pie you have ever had. Ever. It's so decadent. I can see why it was Aunt Helen's favourite. I made a sound to express how delicious I found the pie to be, however  Edna just stared. I didn't think much of it as we are at a wake and it's not a joyful event. I then asked my wife if it would be okay if I tried some of the whipped cream to enjoy with the pie , she silently passed me the cream. I know I made another sound, but it was just a nice ""mmm"" sound- again to show my pleasure.  Edna soon left the table and my wife followed. I assumed for grieving reasons.

On the car ride home my wife told me how I made her 94year old grandmother so uncomfortable as I was moaning loudly and repeatedly at the table. My wife said it was over the top and her grandmother called it ""vulgar"". 

I told my wife I was not moaning sexually over the pie, however she did not believe me as she said I moaned harder after she passed me the whipped cream and I made a scene at the wake, moaning ""sensually"" over chocolate pie and whipped cream while licking my lips and fingers (I'm sorry, is this a crime?). As she was telling me this she got a text from her brother apparently joking about the ""erotic pie"", and it made her more pissed at me.

I honestly don't see how IATA or if she is just grieving and making up reasons to fight. I know I made some sounds, but they were ""mmmm"" sounds you make when something is delicious, it was a moan to express pleasure of the pie, clearly not to indicate my arousal, I was not aroused by the pie.

AITA here? Should I just apologise?

EDIT- I will not be asking grandma Edna for the recipe, the poor lady will think I am wanting it for unholy reasons 

EDIT- I have taken accountability for the way my moans made my wife, her brother and grandmother feel. I moaned too loud and too often. 

EDIT- This wasn't meant to be a funny post but I am glad it made some laugh. Thank you for your time and the awards, I didn't expect many replies. I will be more reserved concerning moaning in public from now on.",Asshole
AITA for not keeping up with my wife’s cleaning demands?,"I had a major fight with my wife a few hours ago and I strongly think I’m in the right but she is so angry I almost feel like I’m the one crazy. I’ll provide context. I married my wife 3 years ago but we have been together 6. One important thing to note is she’s extremely clean. I regret not moving in together until we married because while I knew she was clean I didn’t know the full extent. Let this be a lesson to live with your partner before marriage. She is the reason why our house looks like a model home. She hates dishes in the sink while I’m content to let them sit for a couple days. She spends her off days scrubbing bathrooms because in her mind they should be cleaned weekly. She doesn’t let me bring my shoes inside and insists I shower immediately when I get home before laying in bed. There are a million more things but hopefully you have an idea. 

This didn’t start hurting our marriage until we had kids. We have a 2 year old and a 1 year old. I’m a SAHD. I left work when our youngest was born and that is when our disagreement on how clean the home needs to be started to get bad. She expects me to do most of the chores now when it used to be primarily her and I wouldn’t mind if they were reasonable. She wants the children to have a bath everyday and I think every 1-3 days is fine. She wants all of their toys put away by the end of the day and I think there is no point when it will be a mess again. She wants the dishes done daily. She wants all house bedding washed weekly. She wants me to vacuum weekly. She wants me to mop every 3-4 days since in her logic the kids spend a lot of time playing on the floor. They will not be hurt or sick if I mop every 2 weeks. Because I don’t play along with most of her demands she ends up being the one to do most of the housework when she gets home or her rare off days.

She works 40-80 hours/week so it is a lot but she does it to herself. I feel I do what is reasonable. This all built up to today. She got home and saw I hadn’t yet washed the dishes and there was still grease/food in some of the pans and on the countertop. Also I hadn’t yet brought in the trash cans from the previous two days when they were emptied. She flew off the handle calling me lazy and a slob. She said she would like for me to return to work since in her eyes I’m doing a poor job and use the money to hire a weekly housekeeper and a nanny who “wouldn’t leave the kids in pjs all day.” I got pissed and told her she is crazy and she works herself up over small things and I will not be leaving my kids with a stranger. She packed a bag for herself and our babies and to her mom’s house. I’m furious. Am I the asshole?

Edit: so I’m the asshole. The common belief is I need to help more around the house. I’ll see what I can do and apologize to my wife. Thanks.",Asshole

AITA for hiding my pregnancy and showing up to SIL babyshower,"I 23f am currently 8 months pregnant. We had been keeping it a secret and planned to tell people around this time, but a few months after my pregnancy my SIL26 found out she was pregnant, and then it just felt awkward to announce. We wanted to wait for the right time. I’ve been with married to my Husband for only 6 months, but we’ve been together on and off since we were 14 (permanently together since we were 16)

When we were 17, we found out I was pregnant I had complications, I gave birth to my preemie stillborn at 25 weeks. So this pregnancy we’ve been extra cautious, and secretive. I haven’t seen family much these past few months and I carry small, but as I developed a bump I’ve been wearing hoodies and loose clothing. With that I kind of just looked like I gained weight. 

We were hesitant on me going, I was just going to send my husband with a gift of mine, but SIL said she really wanted me there. I decided to try my best to hide the bump and go.

It was all going well, no one noticed, I mean I got a few looks but no one asked me anything. Then about an hour in I started having tiny cramps, that eventually got more aggressive. I told my husband we need to leave I need to go to the hospital. As We we’re walking a sharp pain hit me and I grabbed the picnic table next to me and almost stumbled over causing attention to myself. I really thought I was in labor, the pains were getting so intense. People started surrounding us, asking what was the matter and my husband says “She’s pregnant, guys she pregnant, something’s goin on, we have to leave.” He was panicked himself. He rushed me to the hospital.


By the time we got the hospital my pains had subsided, they said it was false labor. My husband and I both had angry texted messages from SIL and other guest at the party about us hiding the pregnancy,how messed up it was, and how they couldn’t believe I showed up pregnant and was secret about it. How I had a “babystunt” at someone else’s shower Just a lot of not nice text. Not one asking if I was alright.",Asshole
"AITA for telling my daughter that she's a rude person for not saying ""please"" or ""thank you""?","Hi. I(37F) have two daughters. E who is 17 and A who is 15. A has autism, aspergers, so she's always been different than the other kids.

When I've brought it up, she says some excuse about it being awkward for her to say those things and that she's uncomfortable.

She told me she does in fact say them, just not always. But I've barely heard it, and I've done a lot for her.

AITA for banning my girlfriend from bringing my friend’s ex over to MY house?,"Recently a friend of mine (Anthony **edit:31**) and his wife (Carly **edit:29**) went through a pretty nasty divorce. They had a child together about 1.5+ years ago and things just weren’t working between them: there were some issues with attraction, he felt it was getting monotonous, he was interested in pursuing other relationships (and ending up finding a spark with a then coworker who’s now his gf), and the whole thing was just a mess. She did end up getting child support and alimony, but there were issues with how his family structures their trust which meant she left a lot on the table. Still even now it’s not like she’s actually below the poverty line or anything, so it’s whatever.

I didn’t think we would be seeing much more of her since she’s my friend’s wife who we weren’t particularly close with, and there's no real reason why we would need to have any more contact than him given that she was his wife. However, my girlfriend has been getting together and commiserating with her for some reason, and now their conflict, which I have deliberately kept away from, is now bleeding into my life too. 

My GF keeps bringing up how unfair what my friend did was, how he’s barely paying anything while they struggle, etc. etc. despite me saying that it’s none of our business repeatedly. Shes constantly passive aggressive towards Anthony even though he hasn’t done anything to her. She’s even brought Carly over while me and Anthony were hanging out saying she’s her friend and she’s allowed to have guests. As you can guess this has led to some heated arguments. She’s glad to know he’s having fun eating edibles and playing video games with children (yes, she even referred to me and our other friend as children to our face - we’re both 22) while she’s exhausted taking care of their child alone, etc..

Now keep in mind this is MY house. My parents gifted me this condo when I graduated, and I pay all the utility bills. I’m letting my GF stay here because her roommate didn’t want to renew the lease. She’s trying to frame this like I’m “not letting her see her friends”, which is absurd. She’s clearly 100% in the wrong here, right?

AITA because we didn't invite our brother on vacation?,"Our parents were always very active people and encouraged us to be very active as well. Myself and most of our siblings thrived in this lifestyle, but one of our brothers hated it. I'll call him Tom. Tom hated being outside, exercising, heat, wildlife, etc... Our parents always encouraged him to at least try something before deciding, but they let him skip things he insisted he didn't want to do.

My brother I'm closest in age with and I wanted to do a snorkeling trip together. While planning, we decided to invite our youngest siblings as well, if our parents would pitch in a bit and were okay with us watching them. We didn't invite Tom (22) though, because we knew he'd hate this trip and we figure he'd be busy with post graduation plans and everything. In addition to snorkeling, we will also be hiking, rock climbing and free diving on this trip. All of these activities are things Tom expressly hates or even cannot safely do.

Tom heard about the trip from our parents and is hurt that we didn't invite him. We explained that the trip would involve a lot of getting up early (which he hates) a lot of physical activity (hates) and very little to no lounging and comfort (his main priories when vacationing). He said he could still come and do his own thing and ""meet us for dinner"" (we aren't planning on hitting any restaurants). I said if he wants he can book his own room on the same dates, but we know he gets really upset when he is woken up early, so we won't share with him because we don't want to deal with that.

He feels like we're bullying him and being dicks for no reason, but we aren't trying to do that. We just want to have a good time. He says it's ridiculous that our brother in middle school and sister with special needs are considered better company than him, which isn't what we said at all, but that's how he's interpreting everything.

D refused because she wants the outfits to be 'modest' - I replied that there isn't anything that immodest about the outfit I chose, and I respect her religious beliefs and she wants to be more modest, but I'm not a part of this religion myself.

She still insisted no even when I tried to compromise, and I said she was acting like a bridezilla and if that's the case, I might be backing out as bridesmaid. Her response was 'okay, sure', but she was snarky and got pissed.

AITA for pointing out hypocritical rules at my sister’s wedding?," My sister (28F) got married 1 week ago. I (26F) have a son (4M) who is the only grandchild on my side of the family. Everyone love him and he loves his aunt. During early wedding planning, my sister suggested that she wanted to have a kid-free wedding, but I didn’t think she was serious as it was so early on. Then, when the invitations came out, I saw on the FAQ page that this was, in fact, a kid-free wedding. I talked to our mother about it and how I was shocked, but she stayed neutral and I didn’t talk to anyone else about it. Now I am not one to start fights, so I obliged and found a babysitter. I was a bit upset, but I tried to still be supportive. 

The wedding day comes and my fiancé and I take our seats and wait for the ceremony to start. While waiting, I see my cousin sit behind us with her 3 year old daughter. I was shocked! It was made very clear to everyone about the no kid rule so I was sure that my family (who adores my sister) would tell my cousin something. Instead, everyone said hi to them and talked about how cute the child was. I was appalled and knew my sister would be upset.

At the reception, I went up to my mom and asked her what she thought of my cousin brining her child. My mom said that it didn’t matter that much and that we should all just let it go. But I was furious! How was this fair at all??

At one point during the wedding, my cousin, sister, and I went to go take a photo at the photo booth area. After the photo, I turned to my cousin and jokingly said “I guess kid-free wedding means different things to different people!” My cousin was shocked and look at my sister and my sister told me to knock it off and that everything was fine. I told her why should I? I followed the rules and left my son at home. My sister told me to calm down and I told her I was calm just confused. I guess we drew attention form some of the other guests and my mother came over and pulled me aside. She told me to stop causing a scene and I said I’m not causing a scene, but simply asking why different rules apply to different people. My sister came over and told me to stop and that I was “ruining her special day’. I couldn’t believe it! My fiancé and I left because I could not stand to be in the same room as my sister then.

Ever since the wedding, my mom has been telling me to apologize. I keep telling her that my sister should apologize to ME. I haven’t spoken to my sister since and I don’t plan on it until I get an apology. AITA?

EDIT: People keep saying that I should not have brought this up at the wedding. But when should I have brought it up?? It seems WORSE to bring it up AFTER the fact doesn’t it?

EDIT #2: To be clear, I originally wasn’t mad at my sister. I was upset at my cousin and slightly upset at my family for not saying anything when they saw the child (I didn’t want a fight to happen, just for them to hold her accountable). However, I got upset at my sister when she got mad at me for bringing it up. I feel like I deserved to let my cousin know how I really felt and I wanted my sister’s support since I followed the rules.",Asshole
AITA for telling my BIL to get over himself and to quit holding a 10 year old grudge?,"My BIL (married to my sister) is a general contractor. About 10 years ago, my dad and brother was building a deck at my parent’s home. They asked my BIL if they could borrow his skid loader but he said no. They prepared the ground as best they could without the skid loader but got to the point they couldn’t go on without it. They went to my sis’s house to ask again but found out BIL went out of town. They talked my sis into letting them borrow it so she took them down to his construction lot and they hooked it up to dad’s truck. 

This next part I’m not sure of since I don’t know much about towing but from what I was told, dad’s truck wasn’t big enough or powerful enough to tow the skid loader on the dump trailer so he lost control and wrecked. The truck, trailer, and skid loader was totaled. The insurance was barely enough to cover the medical costs and the truck. There was none left over to cover BIL’s stuff. When he got back to town, he exploded. He threaten to sue and things just went downhill from there. My parents are not rich and he wouldn’t have gotten anything so in the end, sis talked him into letting it go. 

However, from that day on he wouldn’t have anything to do with our family. He doesn’t come for birthdays, holidays, nothing at all. Next month is our parent’s 50th anniversary and we’re planning a big family gathering to celebrate. We’re also chipping in to send our parents on a cruise to Mexico because they’ve never been out of the country. I spoke to sis about it the other day and she said she’s coming with the kids but BIL is not coming. I was fine with that but when we were discussing their portion of the cruise money, I heard him yelling in the background to deduct their portion from the cost of the skid loader and dump trailer. That pissed me if so after my call with sis, I called BIL and told him to get over himself. I told Dad and bro made a mistake but that was 10 years ago and he needs to let it go. He said he’ll let out go when they give him the money he lost. I told him he’s an ass for holding on to a grudge and putting money in the way of a family relationship. 

Sis called me a few minutes ago and said they’re not coming and that I was out of line. We argued for a bit and that’s where it stands. 

I don’t think I’m wrong for telling him to let go of the past but they’re not coming to the anniversary party so now I’m not sure.

Answers to your questions:

Let’s get something straight. My dad and brother are not bad people. They are good people who made a mistake. They couldn’t pay back BIL because he wanted almost $70,000 and again, we’re not rich. Dad had to buy another truck because he needed it to go to work.

On the other hand, BIL had 3 other sets of skid loaders and dump trailers on his lot that day so he could take the financial hit while my parents would be homeless. BIL and sis are way better off then the rest of us so while I understand your reasoning of paying BIL back, he doesn’t need it.

The cruise to Mexico isn’t some millionaire trip. The total cost is about $3,000 and it’ll take over 20 people to pay for that. Again, we’re not rich. We can barely cover $3,000 spread out over 20 people so there’s no way we can pay $70,000.",Asshole
AITA for not letting my stepson come on holiday with us,"I (26f) and my partner (26m) have 3 kids between us, I have 2 daughters(9f,7f) and he has a son (12m). My stepson used to stay with us at the weekends but as he has to share a room with my daughters, he has decided he doesn't want to stay anymore (which is fair enough! He's getting older and wants space, plus he is getting too old to share now) I don't have a problem with this AT ALL! He needs to do what is is best for him and I'm not going to force him to come to my house all the time when he doesn't want it but he also doesn't want to spend any time here whatsoever.

He wants to spend all his time at his grandma's. Now we all went away last year, he had his own room and we had a relatively good time! I was planning on booking a holiday for the end of this year but I told my partner that I wasn't paying for SS to come with us as by the time we go, he would of spent zero time with the family and probably wouldn't enjoy coming away with us for a week as he doesn't enjoy being around my kids anymore and doesn't really like me.

 My partner threw a massive tantrum and said I was purposely leaving him out of stuff just to be spiteful but in reality, I'm the one who pays for everything I.e. the holiday, clothes, food, activities etc when we are away and I want to enjoy myself and let my kids enjoy it without ss moaning about being here in the first place (which he will and did the last time we went away) and I don't want to pay for someone who doesn't want to be here in the first place.

In the morning I noticed I left my tablet's stylus pen in their room and I needed it to get on with my work. So I thought I'd wait for them to get up and then I'll get it. I waited an hour and they didn't wake up. So I went into their room, retrieved the pen, walked out and closed the door. I didn't wanna wake them up because they had come a long way on a long flight.

My daughter later confronted me about it, and said she was extremely uncomfortable by what had happened. She said it was inappropriate for me to go in. I was like sure but nothing bad happened. It was not a big deal.

She was mad and said what if none of them were wearing something appropriate and she insisted that this was an invasion of her privacy. I told her that was not the case. It really wasn't. I didn't even look but I noticed they were only cuddling and they were asleep so nothing was inappropriate in that sense.

My daughter left much earlier than planned and demands an apology before ever coming to visit again. I don't think I did something crazy. It was just a second. Does this make me an AH?

Edit: I didn't knock because I knew they were tired and didn't want to wake them up. It got brought up a lot and I thought I'd add it here. I also didn't think they'd be in an  indecent situation because my daughter would never do that in our home.

Edit 2: I accept my verdict that I am indeed the AH in this scenario. I would like to thank everyone who took the time to tell me their judgement. However, some of the comments are absolutely unnecessarily rude and I wish I could unread them. Have a nice day.",Asshole
AITA for making my daughter quit being a production assistant for a local movie?,"My (55M) daughter (17F) has been homeschooled for the past five years and is very passionate about filmmaking. She writes her own scripts, made her own short film two years ago, and is considering film school for college.

She found out that the big university in our city has a film program that was about to start production on a full-length movie, completely ran by the film students. She contacted the team and we all met together to talk about our daughter joining the project as a volunteer production assistant so she could gain experience during the two weeks they'd be filming.

So she did, and the first day of filming, I promptly dropped her off at the set. (Our daughter can't yet drive to places on her own. She's been learning how to drive off and on since she was 15 and got her permit, but she doesn't have her license yet and we're not comfortable with her driving on her own, especially to unknown locations.)

First day, my daughter didn't leave the set until 8pm...nearly a 12-hour day for her. Second day was similar, and then the third day, after getting there at 7amish, my daughter called me to pick her up at nearly 10/11pm.

After the third day, I had enough. That is a ridiculous amount of time and has to be a violation of some labor law somewhere. Not to mention, I have to stay in that part of town to pick her up, not knowing when she'd call and not wanting to leave her alone waiting for me, especially at night, so for those three days, my son (11M) and I had to drive around trying to find things to burn time. It's unfair to all of us.

I admit I was angrier than I would have liked, but when I picked her up that night, I told her what they're making her do is unacceptable, unfair and she's emailing them that night that she is quitting. She insisted 12/13/14-hour long work days are ""normal"" in the film world, but I still made her go through with the email.

My daughter has been since sulking around the house. To me, my decision made sense, which has also been backed up by my wife. AITA?

ETA: I know these posts have a penchant for attracting moody teenagers who use this forum to rant against the minor complaints they have against their parents. Can any PARENTS/30+ adults chime in?

ETA 2: Some things are being missed here. Maybe I overshot with making her call the whole thing off...maybe. But there a lot of people in the comments insisting I am such an unsupportive parent, when newsflash, I said in the first paragraph of my post that she made a short film not too long ago. That was a short film WE largely funded, because the grant she won from a local film co-op barely covered anything. We rented out a studio so she could hold auditions, paid for props, drove her to set and to the premiere, my wife helped design a lot of the set...I could go on. We clearly support her dreams to the max. ",Asshole
AITA for telling my sister she is better off being infertile?,"Despite trying to conceive for years and having no success with her husband every month, my sister (31F) felt like a supreme disappointment. Her head knew she was not at fault, but she was saying that not being able to give her husband ""the gift of children"", which is seen to most people as a wifely duty made her feel broken and not whole. 

Finally she consulted her doctor, only to be diagnosed with endometriosis. A simple surgery, which was scheduled for last week, was supposed to correct the problem. She was ecstatic. Only to come out of anesthesia and be told by the doctor that he is sorry but children would not be an option. 

As you can imagine, she felt devasted by these news. Yesterday I went to visit her to try to lift her spirits. I told her how incredibly sorry I was. But then I also added that being infertile may not be all that bad. Raising kids isn't all sunshine and roses. There is the added stress, expenses, sleep deprivation and time commitment. I told her to look at all the unhappy couples with kids, and that at least she and her husband would enjoy some extra freedom.

After these comments, my sister's sadness turned into anger. She started shouting at me and told me to leave her house. She had also informed our mother because she called me later to tell me that my comments were disgusting and I should feel ashamed of myself. I feel like me trying to help my sister only made the situation worse.",Asshole
"AITA for not letting my daughter (12) prepare meat in our(44F, 46M) house?","I (44F) have been a vegeterian from age 19, almost as soon as I went to college. My Husband, Bill, wasn't when we met, and became one over time. I truly don't think there is anything wrong with being an omnivore, I think humans are omnivores, but I am just against factory farming and the environmental impact of meat diets, and I figure if there is one way I can help, it is that way. 

 I never pushed it onto Bill.. except I always had one rule before we lived together, and I also had a firm boundary when we moved in. I do not like meat being prepared in my home, and on dishes I use. The smell just makes me nauseous and sick. I know my aversion to it is slightly off-putting, I am autistic and I think it is apart of my sensory issues. As I said, I am fine with it in general, and going out and smelling it also makes me feel that way but it is less so... because I feel like if you cook indoors it hangs in the air. Anyways, it is a firm boundary.

My daughter, Sam(12F) was never raised SPECIFICALLY vegeterian, but at home, that is how we ate. Or if we ordered out for her, we would choose the vegeterian option. She ate mostly vegeterian.

In the last year, she has been really wanting to eat meat. I tell her fine, we can go out to eat and eat it sometimes, but we are not rich, so we really only go out eat once or twice a month. We might get fast food here and there. 

I know she eats it at school, but now she is asking us to make it at home, and we refused. She said she could cook it, but I don't even want her to cook it... I just can't have it in my home. She was giving us the cold shoulder hardcore, and refused to leave her room. I am at a loss here... I work hard to live in this home, and even though I know my aversion is a lot, I want to live in my space comfortably. 

My mom found out and told my sister... who always has something to say about me. My sister is saying I am TA, but I said maybe she could take her out to eat and buy some meat or have her over and make dinner? She does live an hour away, so I get it is far, but she never makes an effort to see us. But I am feeling kinda shitty, maybe I should just buy new pots and pans and let her do it. I am not sure. I feel conflicted.

TLDR: AITA for not letting my daughter prepare meat in our home, even though she is offering to cook it? I am just uncomfortable with it and would prefer for it to not be cooked in my home.

EDIT: Woah! Posted this and had a busy night, and logged back on this morning. Will be checking out all the comments. Thank you for your feedback everyone.

EDIT 2: One main thing I think I am going to do is try to scrape together some money for a cooking class for her. As I said, we are not rich, so we can't afford too many luxuries like eating out, but I could tighten the budget and potentially get her some cooking classes. It just isn't sustainable for the long run. We also have nowhere to grill - we live in an apartment with no balcony. I am also confused if people are missing that she eats meat at school daily, because people are talking about how it is unfair that she only gets to eat meat once or twice a month when we are out.",Asshole
AITA for refusing to give my sister's number to my gf?,"So I (27M) have known this girl(22F) for almost 2 years and we've been in a distance relationship ever since. We've talked almost daily for hours.

We were talking last night and I was about to sleep, she asked me for my sister's number to pull a prank on her (they've spoken 1-2 times before a while ago). My sister is the same age as me, but our relationship isn't very close, thus I didn't want to involve her in this.

She asked me in the afternoon a few times, I tried to avoid her request and change the topic until she insisted. Then until night, I told her that I wasn't comfortable involving my sister in our relationship.

She got furious about that and she felt that I didn't trust her or that I was treating her as a criminal and that she didn't deserve that.

Now, I understood why she would think that and I tried explaining my reasoning but she got even angrier and refused to listen. I thought that the subject was overblown so I eventually apologized and sent her the number but she didn't want it anymore and hung up.

After some chatting, she said some not-very-nice things and ended up blocking me.

I'm curious If am I wrong for refusing her request or if she is wrong for getting super mad at this.

ps: I'm posting this at her request and she will be reading the comments.

"AITA for saying ""I don't want to die"" when a girl said she could spot me?","Earlier today, I was benching in my school's gym. I usually don't go on Tuesdays but I'm trying to throw in some more work throughout the week. There wasn't really anybody I know for real when I was up there so when I needed a spot I just called out to no one in particular asking for a spot.

The first person to say something is this girl who I knew would be no help. Not a beat after she finishes saying that she can spot me I say ""I'm not tryna die today."" She had this offended look on her face and I was like ""Can you deadlift 315?"" She ain't say nothing and I said ""That's what I thought."" I get somebody else to spot me and go on and finish my workout.

When I'm walking about trying to get to my car to go home; she comes up to me and starts jawing about how I was sexist and all that. That I was disrespectful just because she was a girl and I should apologize for being misogynistic. That's not true at all, I just knew she wouldn't be able to do anything if I were to fail the rep. When I'm doing a hard workout I do tend to be short with people so maybe I could've been a little more polite but I don't think I did anything wrong. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for asking my son's boyfriend's parents to limit their time together?,"My youngest ""Oscar"" (15M) has been with his first love ""Andre""  (15M) for almost a year and a half now. It's really sweet and Andre is a wonderful boy and he comes from a good nice family.   Thing is Andre had leukemia when he was younger and  a few months ago it came back.... He's started chemo and he's progressively gotten sicker and has been spending more and more time in the hospital.

I understand how sad this is it hurts my heart and I know how hard this is on Oscar. Oscar has been there for Andre, going to visit him all the time, sitting with him through chemo , trying to keep his spirits up etc. I love that about Oscar ,but I can tell it's starting to weight on him heavily and hrs spending so much time taking care of Andre that's he's not taking care of himself or enjoying much of anything. His grades have also slipped and he's been do exhausted and down. I feel like he might burn himself out. We still don't know wether or not Andre will beat this , but I don't want Oscar getting ""stuck"" and  to know that regardless of what happens he has to take care of himself too.  That he doesn't have to feel guilty  about living his life and  not just constantly taking care of Andre.

My husband protested ,but I had a talk with Andre's parents last week  about limiting Oscar's time with Andre at least for a while and they agreed with me. Yesterday I found Oscar crying in his room and I asked if something happened and he told me that Andre's parents had been limiting his visits and that he doesn't know what's going on or why. I told him the truth and he yelled at me about how could I do something like that. I tried to explain to him that it was for his own good and that he couldn't live only for Andre. He just yelled at me to leave him alone and hasn't talked to me since yesterday afternoon. His dad basically said i told you  so and my older kids think I overstepped.  AITA?",Asshole
WIBTA if I told our parents my brother is lying about his paychecks?,"My (17f) brother (15m) and I's parents have a rule for jobs. We get to keep 1/3, 1/3 goes to college, and the rest goes into an account for us to get when we turn 21. I think that's a pretty fair rule, and it's what I'm doing since I've started working. My brother has always complained about our parents ""taking"" his money, but since we live under their roof I think they have every right to do it.

We thought my brother was making $15 an hour, and they were splitting the money like that. Well he told me the other day that he got a raise to $18 and hasn't told our parents. He just pockets the extra money. I really think that's disrespectful towards them to break a rule like that.

AITA for not organising anything for my girlfriend's birthday?,"My girlfriend is upset with me for not organising anything for her birthday. I had floated the idea of going to do an activity together such as bowling, but i hadn't booked anything. She had been in a very bad mood for a few weeks prior to her birthday due to an argument with her brother, and i wasn't sure if she would want to actually do anything. 

So the day came and we just wandered around our area. She said she thought i had booked bowling, but i hadn't and unfortunately it was fully booked when we arrived. We ended up sat in a cafe and she was just sat opposite me crying, which has been fairly constant recently. She's very difficult to cheer up and just wants to keep talking about this argument with her brother.

Anyway, she's now bringing it up that she always organises and books something for my birthday. She has always booked something and makes the days fun. She is also telling me she always bakes me a cake, and had organised me a surprise party with all my friends a few years ago. She's throwing these things in my face and she's angry that i have never given her a birthday cake.

SShe seems to be forgetting that i never ask for these things and i'm not very good at organising things. She's been in a bad mood and i didn't know if she's actually want to do anything. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for giving my wife and dog similar nicknames?,"I got myself a dog 2 years ago and have been with my wife since we were teenagers (12 years). We are currently 16 weeks pregnant with our first (and probably last) baby. Our miracle baby. Her hormones have been off the charts, as to be expected, as this pregnancy has been difficult for her. 

To cut to the issue: since my wife has become pregnant my dog has become a whine ass, to put it bluntly. The vet states it's just the dogs way of expressing concern for my wife and that she now has anxiety; more than likely caused by my wife's difficulty and emotions. Recently I started referring to my dog has ""pupperino"" whenever she starts whining. Ex: ""what's wrong pupperino"". The first few times I said this, my wife just went quiet and removed herself from the room. But recently, when I called my wife the nickname I had given her 12 years ago, she told me to never call her that again (Baberino). When I asked why, she said I tainted the nickname for her and she never wants to be called something that is that closely similar to what I've been calling my dog. I admittedly don't see what the issue is but with that said, my buddy is on my wife's side and said that since I knew my wife's hormones and depression was in full spike, calling my dog a nickname that was so closely similar to that of which I've been calling my wife for years is basically disrespectful. AITA?

ETA: my wife absolutely loved her nickname but now it truly bothers her when I call her baberino because I now call the dog pupperino. She is admittedly completely fed up with my dogs behaviors (the whining and anxiety, which causes her to be underfoot 24/7 now) so I can see why it would bother her but I admittedly still don't see the issue.",Asshole
AITA for not letting our daughter move back home?,"My husband and I have 3 children (25f)(16m)(13f). Our oldest moved out 3 years ago with her boyfriend, and got an appartment. They were together 4 years before that, so it wasn't like she ran off with some guy she just met. We supported her decision, she was old enough and working full time. 

The issue is rent in our area has more than doubled on average since. Their landlord raised the rent 40% in the span of 3 months, and they couldn't afford to stay there anymore. The issue is they weren't exactly swimming in cash before that, they don't really have enough for first last and security with the market, not that there's much to but anyway in their price range.

Their plan was to move in with her boyfriends parents for a few months while they figured stuff out and saved up, but they won't let her come with. So they proposed an idea, she'd move back in with us, him with his parents, and they'd save up and be gone in 6 months tops. The issue is me and my husband don't feel that's appropriate. She's an adult now, and she needs to learn to take care of herself, not relying on handouts from her parents. She offered to pay rent, but we would only do that if she agreed to pay the market average plus her share of utilities, which would mean she couldn't save up like she wants to.

Because we aren't doing that, she's been force to share a 2 bed appartment with 6 other people, some of whom she finds ""sketchy"". I feel for her, but I still think it's her responsibility. At this point she doesn't call much anymore and I'm worried this may have impacted our relationship.",Asshole
AITA for asking my step daughter to cook for us,"My (45M) step daughter (17F) is a phenomenal cook. I'm talking homemade pasta sauces, scratch baking, hell, sometimes imported seasonings. 

But she only does it for herself.

When we're all busy and need to do 'DIY dinner' nights and can't all sit around the table, you can smell her homemade garlic pesto or vegan teriyaki stir fry all over the house, and it gets irritating. We get her ingredients that she uses up quickly and never makes meals to share with, and I'm getting annoyed.

So I asked her earlier tonight if she would start making dinner for us all more frequently (I didn't say every night) and she got annoyed and mouthy with me, saying she's drowning in school work, her internship, and her commissions (very talented digital artist) and can't ""babysit"" us because ""you never learned to cook"". She claims her sparse dinner preparations are a treat when she's up to the task and feeling nice, and she can't be expected to come up with something new and fresh every night. 

She's doing it for herself anyway, why not for the rest of us? 

So I told her to just do the dishes and go to her room. She did the dishes and stomped off and hasn't come out since, and my wife thinks I'm TA here, but I think I'm in line. She lives under my roof and doesn't pay rent, and she's already cooking every night for herself anyway.

I then, as a joke, said ""at least she'll still be tight down there."" My GF looked confused and then said that was a weird comment to make about her friend. I then said it is a very normal joke to make and she disagreed. TLDR there was some back and forth, i asked her to drop it and she kept trying to talk about it. I said to her ""youre so insecure"" and she then goes ""does it make you feel good to call me that?"" so then I got really frustrated, got up, and walked out of the restaurant and drove home. She called me several times (I drove both of us there) but I was so frustrated and just wanted to get home so I turned my phone off.

Both my wife and I are tall, but he's set to pass me since he's 5'10"" and well built. He's a great kid, and I've never suspected him of saying or doing anything bad. We have a big yard and garden, and he'll go out there a lot to read or just mess around. 

Now our neighbors yard is about 100 feet away, and there's these little patch of trees between us, but we don't have fences so you can see into eachothers yards. We don't really talk or know eachother, but he's got two daughters a bit younger than my son. 

The other week, neighbor comes and says my son is making his daughters uncomfortable. I asked if he did anything, and he says no not like that, it's just he sort of intimidates them hanging around the yard. I talked with my son and he confirmed he never even looks in that direction, he never talks to them or even heard or saw them being uncomfortable.

So I had a talk with my son eariler than I expected to. I told him that sometimes, people are going to be uncomfortable around him. That isn't his fault or their fault, we just need to respect other people, and make sure we aren't imposing ourselves on others. I get it, I'm a big guy. I have to cross the street all the time because women will speed up when they see me, which I completely understand. Hell I even try to stay in more to avoid that.

So I told my son that I'm not mad, but he probably shouldn't linger out in the yard alone anymore. He was upset but understood. My wife is furious, she says I should've talked to her first (and she's right on that front) and that our sone hasn't done anything. I get that, but still I don't think he should be in the yard if he's making other people uncomfortable.",Asshole
AITA for refusing to change litter box every day as it’s a waste of time?,"My (m35) girlfriend, Abby (f32) of 6 months has 2 cats. A week ago, she broke her leg and arm while climbing a climbing wall. I offered to help her with chores (we don’t live together) and that I’d stay with her while she can’t do much. 
She didn’t want to accept saying it’s too much work but insisted. Thought it would be great trial run to potentially living together in the future (we haven’t talked about that yet). Like I said, she has 2 cats. Her cats don’t go outside and she has carpets in her flat. She has 3 litter boxes. She instructed me that the need to be scooped daily and wiped down on the sides with pet wipes and she said carpets need daily hoovering with cats.

At first, I didn’t mind but it quickly got annoying. I tried talking to her about this, suggesting that 3 litter boxes is too many, that it can be cleaned every few days, etc. i tried to get her to see that she was being unreasonable and over the top. But she wouldn’t budge, always finding an excuse on why she needs to do it that way.

One day I was about to scoop the litter box and there was just one poop. I told her that’s ridiculous, it’s just one thing, it can stay here until the next day. She asked if I was at least going to hoover and I said no, there’s only some fur on the ground and a few pieces of litter, it’ll be fine until the next day.

She got annoyed with me. 

The next day she told me her mother was coming to stay with her and that I had to leave and she’d call me later to chat.

Honestly, I was pissed off and we argued and she called me a selfish asshole. 

She still hasn’t called me and my mates said I should’ve waited with changes until we were living together because she couldn’t dismiss my point of view then.

I don’t know, I kind of feel bad, I mean she couldn’t really do it herself. Was I the asshole, should I call first and apologise (she still hasn’t called me). AITA?",Asshole
AITA for leaving my son's wedding after he denied his stepmom a mother-son dance,"My son ""Jordan"" is 27. His stepmom ""Natalie"" came into his life when he was 16.

We got there and the atmesphere was great, Until later when I found out that Jordan had denied Natalie a mother-son dance and instead chose his aunt to dance with him. Natalie told me this minutes later and I couldn't help feel irritated and quite upset. I decided to get up and leave and we both left. I got calls from my family after they saw me leave. And Jordan called later and I told him why I did it. He got mad and said it was his wedding and that his aunt is basically a mother to him and said that Natalie shouldn't expect ""special treatment"". I said it's not special treatmrnt but a tradition.

AITA for telling my stepson to stop talking about his dad?,"My wife and I got married last summer. I have a son (14) and a daughter (12) with my ex-wife and my wife has a son (7) with her ex-husband. We all moved in together in late 2021. My kids get along great with their stepbrother and they adore me wife. I have had a trickier time bonding with my stepson. We have my kids every other week and my stepson goes to his dads every other weekend. 

My stepson is a massive daddy's boy. His dad takes him on some kind of ""adventure"" every weekend they're together. He is always talking about what he is going to do with his dad or what he and his dad did at the weekend. Which is annoying but fine. However, recently he keeps comparing me to his dad. Saying things his dad would do differently or telling me his dad can do something so I should be able to too. 

Last weekend we went camping, which is something we've not really done before as a family. When it came to building a campfire my stepson started complaining I was doing it wrong (I was following a YouTube tutorial) and tried to interfer with what I was doing. Then he said ""how are you a man but don't even know how to make a fire"" before going on to talk about how his dad could light a fire with a stick. I was already stressed about the whole weekend and I ended up snapping at him and telling to shut up about his dad. 

Obviously, I was in the wrong for snapping. After finishing the fire I went to apologies to him and let him know I was in the wrong for talking to him like that. I did however, reaffirm that I would like it if he stopped talking about his dad so much. 

Later in the week he must of said something to my wife about not being allowed to mention his dad. She is now mad at me for having this discussion with him even though I know she finds it annoying as well. In truth I have always felt self conscious about my wife's ex-husband as he is very stereotypically masculine guy (ex-marine) and I'm the opposite. My wife's sister called me an ""over correction"" to my face a few months into dating. It's also frustrating to see how much my stepson idolises his dad when he doesn't know how much his dad hurt his mom. He cheated on her, was abusive, and continued to financially abuse her post separation. His dad has refused to have any more custody time with his son and even when we went on our honeymoon last year he sent his son to his moms rather than look after him himself. I know how much it hurts my wife to see her son favor his dad when he does the bare minimum as a father and damaged her so badly. AITA for suggesting he stops talking about his dad so much?",Asshole
"AITA for ""profiling"" a teenage boy?","Last weekend my wife and I left town to attend a wedding. We left our 17 yo son at home and permitted him to have a small party. We told him not to allow to many people and not let it get out of control. 

On the night of the party, we checked our security cameras a few times and everything looked fine with no more than 40 kids. However, on the drive home my wife received a call from a parent of a girl who had been at the party. The girl had admitted that at the party she had done cocaine and had said many others at the party had as well. She didn’t say who supplied the coke. 

My wife spent the rest of the drive looking through the footage from that night. Specifically, to see who came inside. She recognized almost all the kids and didn't see anyone that looked older than a highschooler. She did spot one boy that she was immediately suspicious of. He's a long-time friend of our son but had been caught by another boy's parents last year smoking weed in their backyard. He has been known for getting in trouble in the past, his dad is currently in prison and his family is also poor so would make sense if he was selling drugs trying to make money for himself. We only have 2 cameras inside the house so they only catch so much, but it was clear the boy spent the majority of the night in the kitchen and seemed to be approached by multiple people (including the girl who admitted to doing coke). 

When we got home, we told our son about the phone call. After a long discussion he confessed that he knew some people were doing cocaine but said he wasn't interested in doing any himself and that he felt uncomfortable with it but didn't know how to tell them to stop. When we asked who had brought the coke, he said he didn't know. When we asked specifically about the boy we suspected, he denied it but seemed to be lying.

My wife contacted many of the parents of the kids as well as the high school to let them know this might be an issue. When the school asked, we told them we suspected the boy, but it was unclear. Apparently, the school had a meeting with the boy about our allegations and they called his guardian (his great grandma).

Yesterday she came to our home and asked us why we had singled out her grandson and wanted to know if we had any evidence that he had been dealing drugs. We told her that we only suspected. She became angry at us for pointing the finger without evidence and for contacting the school at all. She accused us of profiling him based on his family and background. 

My wife doesn't think we did anything wrong but I'm starting to have my doubts. The school is conducting interviews with kids that were at the party. Apparently, the boy is in danger of being kicked off the soccer team and possibly expelled depending on the outcome. AITA? We were only trying to provide the best information we could to the parents and school to help protect their kids as we obviously feel responsible for allowing this to happen in our home.",Asshole
AITA for telling my brother that if our stepsister aren't his siblings then neither am I?,"My (19f) mother got married to my stepfather 3 years ago. He has two daughters (13,9) and I love them and don't even call them stepsisters. My brother (16M) never really accepted our mom remarring, or the move to a new town and school, even though we were much better off money wise. He still calls our stepfather his moms husband (I just call him my dad, bio dads a cheating slimeball)

He never listens to a thing dad says, which means he's spent most of the last 2 years grounded. And he refuses to even call his sisters his stepsisters, they're just, his ""moms husbands kids"". He openly says he has no love for them, that he never will, and even said when he has his own family he'll never invite them to anything.

I got sick of this during winter break when I was home again. I told him they're his sisters as much as I am, and if he doesn't consider them as such then I'm not his sister either. I told our parents I'm not coming home for spring break this year, and that until he fixes his attitude and apologizes I'm not going to be in the same room as him.

Apprently he decided to go live with sperm donor, and at his age the courts will basically let him. If that's the company he wants then I say good riddence, but mom's been pretty upset about it. Still I don't think I was wrong, but it's possible I went too far.",Asshole
AITA for not letting my son wear an eye patch?,"My son is 14 years old and about a month ago and unfortunately was in an accident that left him permanently blind in his left eye. Otherwise he's uninjured. I can't imagine how he feels about it. Losing a part of you like that and being unable to do the sports he loved playing anymore.

While it was healing the doctors had him cover it up to help the process. Now that the medical stuff is off he told me that he wanted to wear an eye patch to cover it up. I told him that I didn't want him to feel the need to be self conscious about it and that he should just accept himself. We ended the conversation there for the time being.

The topic came back up again after another week of him being in school, he told me he was tired of the other kids looking at him and asking him about it. I told him that that wouldn't go away with an eye patch and would probably warrant even more questions from people. He got mad at me for not letting him do it and said that I was crazy not just going with it. I think it's best if he just keeps it as it is. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for saying it’s my wife’s fault that my slacks didn’t get packed for my work trip?,"Hi, first time poster. My wife (30F) and I (31M) have been married for about 7 years now. I decided to go on a last minute work trip which caused me to have to book flights, hotel, etc. late at night and then fly out the next day. I needed new work slacks for the trip since I’ve primarily been working from home in my current company, so we had to make a late night run to the local Walmart to get a few pairs. We also got some button up shirts. When we got home I had some stuff to finish up with the planning so I asked my wife to wash my new clothes so that my shirts weren’t so wrinkly. I handed her the shirts to wash separately and put the pants in the dirty laundry. 

While they washed she packed my suitcase and then added the shirts when they were done. When it came time to leave, I verified everything was packed by asking her if she packed my pants. She said yes.

Cue to late the next night when I arrive at my hotel and my slacks aren’t in there—only my brown khakis and gray khakis. I called her pretty upset asking where my slacks were. She got defensive and told me she thought she packed all my clothes (I had laid them out on the bed besides the stuff to be washed) and told me they should be in there. I made her check the laundry room to be sure and she looked around the whole house before finding them in our bedroom laundry basket unwashed. 

I repeated a few times how I was frustrated that she hadn’t packed them but had told me that she did. She said she didn’t realize by “pants” I meant my slacks and that she was busy trying to do other stuff and just had a memory of packing some pants with all the other things I had laid out. She also said it was unreasonable for me to be upset with her when they are my pants and she didn’t think she was expected to do a whole second load of laundry at midnight.

In the end she attempted to make me feel better by saying that it would be okay and my work would understand that sometimes things get a bit hectic with packing and traveling last minute (and I can buy more in the evening hopefully). I feel kind of bad cause I could tell she was frustrated with me for blaming her, but in my defense I did ask her if she had packed everything.

Edit/Update: I accept that IATA and have apologized to my wife. She responded graciously and told me she knows a lot of it was just my stress from traveling and worrying about work. We are good now and I promised to do better in the future. Thanks to everyone who engaged with me civilly in the comments. I showed my wife the post and she wants to say that she is a little surprised at how angry everyone else was (she says she was frustrated but knew it’s not a pattern), especially some individual messages that some very angry people decided to send me.

TL;DR my wife forgot to pack my slacks for a work trip and I was frustrated with her over the phone so we argued. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for not giving my daughter her education fund money?,"I (54M) have two children (23F and 21M) with my wife (52F). When the kids were young, my parents set up education funds for both of them, which was very generous of them.

My wife and I always expected our kids to attend college and then graduate school, as we have done. I have a PhD, my wife has a master's. Because of this, we decided not to use the funds for our kids' undergrad degrees and did not tell them about the money.

My daughter has always been more into the liberal arts, while my son is more of a STEM guy. My wife and I worried about her ability to find a job, but she insisted on studying music and film in college. She was accepted to some top schools and chose to attend a rather expensive one, but she had scholarships to cover almost all of her tuition. Everything else, plus living expenses, was her responsibility. She lived in a very small apartment shared with friends in a not-so-nice area far from campus, but she was fine and learned how to budget effectively. After graduating, she luckily found a job that doesn't pay extremely well but she enjoys, and scrapped the idea of grad school.

My son decided to do engineering, and he also expressed that he had no interest in grad school. My wife and I were disappointed, but accepted it since at this point he is already all set up with a very good job when he completes school. Since he did not receive as many scholarships as his sister, we decided to use his education fund to cover his tuition and living expenses. He was able to get a large and nice apartment of his own close to the school, which is important since his classes are so demanding and he needs a comfortable space to work.

My daughter was confused and asked how he could afford this, and he told her about the education fund. She called us and asked why she didn't have one, and we told her she did, we just didn't use it because we hoped she would attend grad school. She seemed hurt by this and asked if there was any way she could have the money now. We explained that there would be a fee to simply withdraw the money for non-education uses, and if we chose to do that it would belong to her grandparents so they could put it towards their own use. She's been quiet and short when answering our texts, and hasn't answered our calls at all since then. I know that it seems unfair to her, but it's not really her money in the first place and she's no longer in college. Plus, her brother only received it for educational purposes and it wouldn't be right for her to just have it to spend now. AITA?

UPDATE: I understand the consensus is that my wife and I are the AH. I texted my daughter to ask if she wanted us to withdraw the money for her/what she wanted to do. This was her response: ""I don't care. Maybe they can transfer it to \[other grandkid who is 5\] if the fee is seriously too much. Idk about grad school I haven't thought about it much recently. If I do apply it wouldn't be for another couple years and I hadn't been counting on having any financial help in the first place so it really doesn't even matter. Thanks for asking tho.""

UPDATE 2: My wife and I are discussing our daughter's response and our next actions to resolve this situation. For context, my wife has always had a strained relationship with my daughter and did not approve of many of her life choices. She believes we should take our daughter's words at face value and assume she no longer wants the money. From some of the responses here, I fear that my daughter's response was out of resentment and I suggested taking out as much money as her brother was given so at least they received the same amount. She could use it responsibly towards rent, groceries, transportation, etc. or in some other way to further her career, so it would still be for ""educational"" purposes in a sense. My wife is standing firm in her opinion, and we will continue talking it through tomorrow. 

Many have asked about where my parents stand on this. At this point, they are not mentally aware enough to really participate in the discussion. They did know about our grad school stipulation and thought it was fine. They also knew that we took out some money for our son once we were certain he was not pursuing an advanced degree, and were fine with that as well. They said it was our decision as parents what to do with our daughter's fund, and they would support whatever we decided for her. It wouldn't be useful to ask them what to do with it now, but I have always said that whatever is unused will go back to their care. I have tried to call my daughter with no luck, which is why I sent the text. Despite what many have said here, I hope this does not end our relationship. ",Asshole
AITA for demanding some of my late FIL's cooking supplies.,"My FIL died very unexpectedly 3 weeks ago, everyone was devastated.  Now that the funeral is over my MIL has been going through his things. My FIL loved to cook it was his favorite thing to do. He got  himself a ton of nice pots/pans/cutting board all different types of kitchen gadgets you get the point. I also love cooking so I thought that some of that stuff would be the perfect thing to have in our home to remember him by.

MIL was over dropping off FIL's golf clubs for my husband so I asked about the the cooking supplies. She said she gave all the fancy stuff to SIL since she just moved into her new condo and cooking was her and her dads thing. They would cook together and go to cooking classes together. I get that but I asked MIL if I could also get some of it to have in our home and cook with to remember FIL by.   

She said said but she has already given it to her. I reminded her that we had a fairly new home too we were trying to furnish and it was unfair for her to get everything it should have been split evenly or we could have all gone though it together and split it up. she once again said sorry she already gave it too her and reminded me about an event that happened a few years ago.

Here where I may be the asshole after SIL moved home from college she has a ton of apt and kitchen stuff from her apt at school. When my husband and I moved into our first apt we took almost all of it. Then I had my bridal shower a few months later. I got a bunch of new stuff and threw out all of SIL's old stuff. It was years old at that point so I didn't think she would want it back. When her and her BF moved into their first apt she was pissed that she had to buy all new things and it was a big deal in the family. We gave them a very nice housewarming gift. 

But this has nothing to do with that. Those were plates and dishes this is pro chef equipment that belonged to FIL. We were close to FIL too and would like to have something to remember him by she isn't even the one who host holiday's in the family. Wouldn't it be nice to know I prepared Christmas dinner with FIL's supplies. I sent SIL a text saying so and she never replied but my husband told me while he thinks it should have been split 50/50 he just wants me to drop it.",Asshole
AITA for telling my wife the onus of responsibility is for her to tell me things and not me to ask about them?,"This question is so strangely unique and absurd, I am almost ashamed to be asking it.

I've been with my wife for five years, married for three. She's a great mother to two young children, she's bright and empathic and she has this one distinct character flaw that I cannot abide. And I will now present it to you here to see if my response has made me an asshole, which she alleges it does.

Last night my wife went out with some girl friends. They like to jump from a few different bars. We text sporadically but I trust her to be safe. She told me at one point she felt she was too drunk to drive and was going to leave her car there. We both have each others location on, so I looked at her location, made a note of it--it was 12 minutes from the house, no biggie. This is an important note and I have thought this in my head but never shared it with her but my wife generally does not tell me: ""We're going from this bar to this one,"" which I like for no other reason than being cognizant of it and knowing where she is at a given time.

She rode with a friend to the next bar and then had me come get her. She had work early in the morning so I took her home, helped her get in bed and then called an Uber to take me down the road to pick up her car. It was almost on empty so I stopped and filled it up and drove it home.

Next morning she woke me up and said: ""We need to go get my car so I can go to work.""

I told her I had already went and got it and fueled it up so she was ready to go. She was pleasantly surprised and said: ""How did you know what bar it was at?""  


I told her: ""Well, when you said you were too drunk to drive I looked at your location and made a note of it. (THIS IS WHERE I THINK I MIGHT BE THE ASSHOLE) But to be honest, I wish I didn't have to do that. I wish you would let me know where you're going to be at just so I know in case anything happens to you. **Sometimes you don't do a great job at keeping me in the loop**.""

Her immediate retort is the character flaw. It doesn't just pop up when she goes out with a friend, it pops up often. She says: ""Well you didn't ask.""  


I had to take two deep breaths and respond: ""The onus of responsibility is on you--the one that is going to these places--to let me know when you are leaving at one, or doing something at another one. I'm not going to just intermittently check your location or try and read your mind.""  


And she let me know that I was being a real asshole here.",Asshole
AITA because I(57f) haven’t met my grandson(3 months) yet?,"My (57f) oldest son Justin (33m) just had a baby boy on November 30 last year. Justin and his wife live an hour drive away however I don’t drive or have a car therefore if I took public transportation it would take upwards of 2hr and a half to see them. Due to them living so far, me being busy with work and the cold winter weather I haven’t made my way out to see the baby. 

I did host a Christmas dinner at a restaurant on December 16th for all my kids in which Justin and his wife said they would try their best to come with baby however they did say it’s not guaranteed depending on how hectic it would be for them with a toddler and newborn. They ended up not coming to the dinner and told everyone their doors are open for visitors during the holidays. None of us visited as we were busy and the commute was too far. I feel like I’ve done my part to see the baby with the dinner plans however it just didn’t work out. 

Last week I received a call from Justin to come meet the baby and see my granddaughter. I told him I had Valentines dinner plans with my boyfriend and can’t come. I could tell he was annoyed on the phone. I really want to meet my grandson however things just haven’t worked out.

I do try to video chat to see their kids once every few months as Justin has made it clear in the past when they haven’t heard from me in over 8 months that I need to make an effort. Life just gets in the way. 

I’ve noticed Justin’s wife stopped sending me pictures of the kids nor does she engage with me about anything.

AITA for telling a girl to stop wasting food?,"I (21f) usually always sit with the same group of people in my university’s dining area. 
There’s this girl who i’ve talked to a few times, but i’m not really friends with. She’s kind of quiet, but when she finally talks she seems normal. 
I’ve sat across from her a few times and noticed how she was eating because it was weird to me. She eats maybe half of her food (keep in mind you control the amount of food. it’s cooked by the cafeteria staff buffet-style. 
she could easily take less) and kind of plays with it with her fork when she’s “done” (aka eating half of it, sometimes even less). 

I didn’t say anything for a while, but a few weeks ago I had to ask her why she always only ate half her food. She seemed a  embarrassed, but answered she thought she was more hungry and laughed it off. I then asked her why she made this mistake every time we ate, and that she must have learned by now. 
She didn’t really answer (I don’t actually remember, but it wasn’t actually an explanation) and left pretty quickly. 
She doesn’t really show up that much anymore, but when she does she still eats like this, and I couldn’t hold it in anymore. I asked her once again, and also asked her if her parents never told her not to play with her food. 

It was a genuine question, some people are raised in households where manners aren’t important, but obviously they are for most people. She got really mad at me and told me to stop commenting on her eating habits and that it was none of my business. I told her that it absolutely was since she was sitting at our table and obviously wasting food. She told me to go fuck myself and left and threw out the rest of her food (AGAIN!) 
After she left, one of my friends told me to leave her alone as she seemed like she was having a hard time and maybe had some sort of issue with food. 
Yeah, obviously she has an issue with food?? She keeps wasting it! She hasn’t shown up again, i’m assuming she buys her own food now, which might teach her not to waste it so that’s good. The same friend who told me to leave her alone keeps pestering me to apologise to her, but I think she should apologise to me. She’s unnecessarily rude when being asked the most basic and obvious questions and also told me to go fuck myself? That’s way more harsh than anything i’ve ever told her. 
Keep in mind that I care a lot about food waste and the environment.

AITA For Calling My Daughter Weird?,"My (46m) daughter (14f) was diagnosed with OCD this year. I will fully admit that it's my fault for not getting her into treatment sooner, because she's been insisting on everything being in multiples of 3 since she could count. Still, I can't change the past, and now she's got a diagnosis. 

Her mother sent her to a psychiatrist who gave her the diagnosis but she's refusing to see him anymore because she said that he scared her. That's fine with me. I can't maker her see him. But I was very clear with her that it's up to her to manage herself if she keeps refusing help. 

Since starting high school her insistence on the number 3 has gotten worse, but she's still refusing to do anything about it. Her mother and I are divorced and share custody so I don't fully know what's going on at her house, but when she's at mine she can't even walk through a door without counting her steps and tapping the door 3 times. My younger sister (30f) lives with me and has seen my daughter displaying this behavior, and she's frequently told me, after my daughter's gone to bed, that she thinks I'm a bad father for raising a ""neurotic, out-of-control child"" (her words, not mine). 

So after a few days of this I pulled my daughter aside and told her that she's being weird and needs to get her behavior under control. I told her quite simply that it's her prerogative if she thinks she can manage herself better than a doctor can but, in that case, she had better actually manage herself. I'm not going to be scorned for bad parenting when I've offered my daughter help.

AITA for bringing an emotional support animal to a funeral despite my daughters wishes?,"I am a 38m. Daughter (Isa, fake name) is 17f. Stepdaughter (Ava, also fake name) is 9f.

Isa's stepfather recently died. I felt terrible because I knew while they weren't super close, he'd been in her life since she was 5, so I knew it must've hit hard. My family was also invited to the funeral.

The issue is, however, is Ava has horrible social anxiety. She's homeschooled because of it and has difficulty going to social outings. She's in therapy and has an emotional support rabbit named Luna. Since this funeral would be pretty crowded, we decided to let Ava bring Luna to the funeral. Isa had a problem with that.

Isa quickly told me she didn't think it was a good idea. Pets were not allowed at this particular cemetery. I told her this was a rabbit (what harm could it do?) and Ava had a medical reason for bringing her rabbit. She then looked it up on google and showed me only service animals were allowed to come. I told her I'd bring Luna, and if an issue arose, we'd leave. She begged me not to, saying her step-dad's death was already hard enough on her mom, and she didn't want any drama to make it worse. I told her I'd think about it and keep that in mind.

The thing is, Ava needs her emotional support pet. She wouldn't make it through the funeral if she didn't. She also really wanted Ava there, so what else could we do?

Isa drove to the funeral with her mom, while my family and I drove together. We brought Luna. Isa and her mom were waiting for us at the entrance when we got out. When Isa saw Luna, she freaked out and started yelling that she told me not to bring her.

I explained Ava's needs, and she then screamed that Ava should've just stayed home then and caused Ava to cry (I felt bad because I know she was already dreading the social interaction, so hearing her sister say that must've hurt her badly). My wife and Isa got into it after that. (not so kind words were spoken by either party)

Her mom took Isa's side and told us to leave. I agreed, and we went home. Isa has been giving me the cold shoulder, but I don't know how else I could've handled this differently.

AITA for telling my boyfriend's dad he was dead?,"My boyfriend left home on his eighteenth birthday after a big fight with his dad. He tried to reach out after that, but his dad completely ignored him and wanted nothing to do with him. My boyfriend was really depressed about it, but he eventually got over it. I remember one night we all got drunk (we're apartment sharing with friends) and he told us that he was dead to his father, and that stuck with me.

Yesterday, he just showed up, my boyfriend's dad, that is. Myself and one of our roommates were the only people home. I answered the door, but I didn't let him in. He said he wanted to talk to his son and I said ""oh, your dead son?"" He must not have remembered or understood the reference, because he went completely pale and asked how/when he died. He looked almost as upset as my boyfriend had been, so I decided to let him stew in it.

I told him a fake story. He looked like he was going to throw up, and he asked if he could come in and have some water. I reluctantly let him, because he seemed very ill. Once inside, my roommate saw us and asked what was going on. My boyfriend's dad asked if he knew his son, and my roommate was super confused and it quickly came out that my boyfriend wasn't actually dead.

My boyfriend's dad was furious. He said I was a sick person with a hateful heart. I told him he said his son was dead to him, so why would he even care. He said he made a mistake in a moment of anger, but I made a cold-blooded decision. My roommate also said that what I did was fucked up.

I went to our room and called my boyfriend, who said to make sure his dad left before he came home, which I did, and he did, reluctantly. I didn't tell my boyfriend about the dead thing, just that he showed up and seemed to regret things. My boyfriend is shocked by his dad just showing up and I don't want to pile more on. My roommate said I was a huge asshole because ""no one deserves that,"" but I'm not sure. He did look so sick, but part of me thinks he brought it all upon himself. I don't know.

Edit: One of you made a compelling case to tell my boyfriend as soon as possible about telling his dad he was dead. He wanted to know what his dad's reaction was and kept asking if he said anything other than asking for more information before he found out it was a lie. He only really asked questions like ""When? How? Was it sudden?"" and such, and my boyfriend was pretty disappointed by that. He's pretty depressed this morning.",Asshole

AITA for not telling my husband about all my reward points cards?,"Edit and Update:

I wanted to clarify some things before I get to the actual update.

Yes, married young. It is a common practice in my religion. We have known each other and have gone to the same church since we were 10. We ""dated"" while we were teenagers but always knew we wanted to marry each other. He proposed to me the second he saw me after coming home from his mission and we got married 6 months later. This was exactly what I wanted.

My husband is not abusive. While he does dictate how much we spend and on what, he doesn't even look at the accounts, except for maybe once every 3 months. Almost everything is automated. I know more about what goes on in that account than he does. He does not hold the money over me.

He is also one of the sweetest, most caring, loving individuals I have ever met. He regularly volunteers for the community and our church, helps out regularly around the house, makes sure to spend time with each of our children and makes sure I feel loved and wanted.

Me being a Stay at home mom is not ""free childcare"". I am taking the time to watch over my own children. They are as much mine as they are his. Saying it is ""free childcare"" would be like calling my husband a ""free gardener"" every time he mows the lawns or calling me a ""free maid"" every time I clean the house.

I agreed to the budget early on. It seemed like a good plan and we agree that it would change and grow as our family does and he moves on in his career. 

Now onto the update:

If I filtered all the ""he is abusive"" posts out of the rating, it is clear that I am the jerk. I honestly don't know why I lied about it in the beginning, but I know I carried on the lie because of the shame and fear of disappointing or hurting him. When I found a way to go on these Girl's trips, I was proud of the fact that I was able to do it my own way. Which is why I got selfish with the points. This wasn't fair.

Last night I made my husband a cup of tea after the kids and we sat down and talked it out. I talked about my desire to see the world as he has (He went to Italy for his mission) and how I have only ever been to Utah and my own province before going on the Girl's trips (Most of which were a week in Mexico or on a Cruise).

He told me that he wishes that I included him in his plan as he includes me in his. He was hurt that I felt I had to hide the cards or how I am paying for these vacations. He also told me that next year his boss is planning to retire and he is the next in line for succession. The position would give him more vacation, a larger bonus and a 50,000/year pay increase. They have just been talking about it this week and he was waiting for the weekend to tell me. He is happy with our budget the way it is, and with this pay increase, we could use the entirety of it for family vacations. With the addition of the points that he will now help me get, we could probably go on two big trips a year.  This made me feel a lot better about the future

So this weekend (Thanks to someone who posted that I could be doing better), we are modifying my points gathering, applying for some new cards for him and planning our first real vacation as a family for next year. I cried when I read a lot of the posts, I felt a lot of shame for how I behaved but I also felt very sad that anyone could think my husband was abusive. Please ask for more clarification before jumping straight to the ""He's abusive"" ""Leave him"" or ""Prepare for him to leave you"". Not everyone is like that.

Original:

I (29F) have been married to my husband (30M) for 9 years. I am a stay-at-home mom with 4 beautiful children ( 8,6,4,2). My husband makes 150k+ a year but decides where every dollar and cent goes.  50% to day-to-day expenses, 25% to the children's education savings, 10% to family savings, 7.5% to his personal spending and 7.5% to my personal spending.  Any bonus he makes or money back from taxes goes immediately into retirement.  Doing it this way leaves us no money for vacations or big trips.

Since we got married and moved in with each other, I have been completely responsible for all the shopping, whether it is clothes, groceries, furniture or whatever else.  I learned very early on with the help of my mom how to coupon clip and how to use points cards to their maximum potential. I usually get 2 or 3 different reward points and save 10-25% per transaction I do.  My husband only knew about the coupon clipping, not the rewards points.

&#x200B;

For the past 5 years, I have been going on a ""Girl's trip"" with my family, every year. I have been telling my husband that my sisters, sister-in-laws, mom and grandma have been paying for me to go since I can't afford it, but in reality, I have been using the rewards points to pay for the ticket, using rewards to pay for our groceries and using my difference to pay off my credit cards so that I am able to go on the trip.

&#x200B;

This year, my brothers, brother-in-laws, father and grandfather decided to do their own ""Boys trip"" and invited my husband.  My husband told them that unless they can help him as the girls help me, he would have to decline the invite. My brother responded to him with ""What do you mean? She says you pay for her to go"".

My husband confronted me about the situation and I confessed to him what I have been doing.  He was extremely hurt saying that with all these points, we could have done a lot more as a family, rather than just one person hoarding them all to themselves. And if I set him up with his own credit cards to get even more points, it would have been a lot easier for us to do big family vacations.

&#x200B;

My entire family has been calling me selfish and a jerk for not being more open about the points but I feel that work very hard to get to the point levels I have gotten to and that making them more open for use would burn through them quickly and not allow them to be used for bigger things.

WIBTA if I told the bride that my aunt is wearing a long white dress before her wedding?,"I'm going to be seeing the bride at her hens night however I do not want to ruin her hens night either so I'm unsure how to meet up or tell her. The bride is my cousins finance. Our family's are very close and she has ALOT of anxiety. She's been planning this wedding for two years getting every detail correct making sure it's perfect and she is literally such a kind person. 

A few days ago my mum called me saying she had spoken to my nan. My nan said my aunty is going to wear white and not just white a long white dress. My nan obviously protested against this but my aunt said ""it's 2023 people can wear whatever they want. No one cares.""

 She did not ask the bride for permission, my aunt is  literally delusional. I mean how hard is it not to wear white for one day? Anyway my mum said ""oh well my aunt can look like an idiot infront of tons of people.""

Yes she will look stupid but my concern is the bride is going to be upset and feel like her wedding is ruined. I don't care about my aunts feelings I care about the bride and making sure she doesn't feel hurt on her wedding day. I told my mum we need to tell her or at least the brides mother in advanced so that the bride can have a good wedding. Unfortunately my mum said I would be an AH if I did that. She said it is not my place but no one seems to be man enough to tell the bride. I don't know what to do, I don't want to piss off my family but I also think she deserves to know and not feel hurt on her wedding day. 

I don't know what to do. I believe this situation should be mentioned beforehand and not on the wedding day.

Edit*** 

So my nan had three daughters (my mum, my aunt and the other aunt (MIL to the bride). I'm referring to the aunt which isn't MIL to the bride. Sorry for the confusion 

Also im planning on finding the brides friends and talking to them later on about it since the hens night is a week away from the wedding. I will not mention anything on the hens night as to not cause any issues. I appreciate the help 🙏",Asshole
AITA for not providing a definition of a word played in Scrabble until clarifying whether the person was challenging the word or not?,"My wife and I were playing Scrabble last night. I can’t even remember the last time I’ve beaten her at the game. We’ve been married 9 years and it’s probably been at least 3-4 years, probably more like 5 or 6 since I’ve beaten her at the game.

We hadn’t played in a while, so clarified the challenge rules near the beginning. I was wondering. If when the challenger is wrong, do they lose their next turn? We clarified that a wrong challenge DOES result in a lost turn.

We are nearing the end of the game, and I actually have a little bit of a lead for a change.

I put down the word “MU.”

She asks “What is that?”

I was thinking she was trying to gauge my response to see whether she should challenge it or not.

I asked “are you challenging it?”

She responds, “well what is it?”

Me: I’ll tell you after you let me know if you want to challenge it or not.

Her: it’s common courtesy to provide the definition of a word you play if someone asks…

Me: I’m happy to tell you after you tell me if you are challenging it or not…

She got upset, saying “I hate the way you play games sometimes.”

She just started looking up the definition on her phone, I clarify again “So does this mean you are challenging it?”

Her: No! I’m not challenging it, I want to know what it is.

Me: okay, we’ll it’s a Greek letter.

I ended up winning the game. She said I was being nasty. I was perfectly calm and just stating that it isn’t a part of the rules to have to provide a definition to the word. And by providing a definition before clearing up a challenge, it can tip the person off as to whether it is a real word or not.

She got mad and stormed upstairs to go to bed.

Conversation continued today. I explained how I was taken aback by her reaction. She says it is common courtesy to provide a definition when asked. She said the conversation “triggered” her, and that if I continue playing that way she will no longer play scrabble with me.

She stormed off again when I asked for clarification about how I was being “rude” during the game.

I explained how, from my perspective, i was completely calm and civil, but she just didn’t like that I didn’t help tip her off as to whether she should challenge the word or not.

Providing a definition is nowhere in the rules, but she says it is common courtesy to provide… I disagree because I think that is an unfair advantage in deciding to challenge or not… am I in the wrong here?",Asshole
AITA for telling my coworker she doesn’t need to be adopted.,"So my coworker (26f) lost her adoptive dad six years ago and live with her adoptive mom. Let’s call my coworker Pam (not her real name) Pam has been working with me for a few months now and it’s really clear that she doesn’t know how to think on her own. Her mom still packs her lunch and she drives her to work when it rains. Now Pam does not have any sort of disability or delays. She is very much able to do everything on her own but has been coddled her whole life. Now her mother has gotten a job offer in another country. Pam has mad it clear she doesn’t want to move and will be staying here if one of her older siblings adopt her. 

She had 3 older siblings (45,42,37). Pam is the youngest and was adopted from another country at the age of 3.   

I told her that it’s so sweet that she will be living with a sibling, but I asked her what she meant by adopting her since she is 26 and the legal age is 21. She says that she needs to be adopted to stay because who’s going to take care of her since her mom is leaving. I asked her to explain… this woman doesn’t pay any bills. She has no idea how to cook for herself or live on her own. I asked her if there’s a reason why she can’t live on her own. She told me that it was too hard and it’s better if someone just takes responsibility for her. I told her that the only way they can “adopt her” is if she releases her rights to her siblings and the court would have to determine if she is incapable to be on her own. She told me “that’s fine I don’t want to be responsible to be on my own.” I asked why she has a job then, and she basically told me she works to fund her shopping lifestyle. She has the latest phone, gets the newest purses, always comes to work with a $7 coffee, and has really nice clothes. I asked why she doesn’t just budget her money better so she can live on her own. She looked at me like I was crazy… I flat out told her that her siblings would not be smart for adopting her because there’s no reason to be adopted. This made her mad and she reported me to HR. I now have to write an apology memo and submit it to her by Tuesday. Now I’m thinking I should have stayed out of it, but this girl has no idea how the world works. Am I the Asshole

Edit- Pam started the conversation and we always have these kinds of talks and even if we disagree we move on. She is one to talk about everything at work. She does more talking than work. This is just the first time HR got involved.",Asshole
AITA for making a parenting decision on my custody time?,"I have a son (15) with my ex-wife. I've been seeing a woman that also has kids. She lets her 14yo drink wine with supper when the adults do (one glass). My son also wanted a glass of wine Saturday night, and I agreed, since the 14yo was drinking it, and because one glass of wine is very little alcohol.

My ex is pissed that I let our son drink alcohol. I said that one glass is not a big deal, and it is legal in our state to give wine to your kid in a private residence. She said she is against it and not to do it again. I said this is a choice I can make on my parenting time. I didn't want my son to feel excluded, and I think it is good for him to learn about other cultures and traditions.

My ex said I'm a bastard. Even some of my friends say it's messed up not to give her a say. I don't tell her what to do on her parenting time. Why should I let her tell me what to do on mine?",Asshole
AITA I told my brother I will no longer pay for his college because he is attending our dad's wedding,"Sorry for bad English. 

My (29m) mom passed away 3 years ago. By the end of her life I was her main carer and spent almost everyday with her. Five months after she passed my dad introduced me to his new girlfriend, who had been his gf in highshool. They aparently rekindled contact after my mother passed and everything went fast after that, but I´m convinced something happened between them prior to my mom´s passing. 

I haven´t really had any communication with my dad since then, apart from things related to my brother (19m). 

Brother is studying in a very expensive private university. I pay for his tuition and other school related expenses, like textbooks and trips and he currently lives with me and my husband. My dad does pitch in a little bit and gives my brother money, but he´s retired and receives a not so great pension. 

My dad is marrying his girlfriend this November. My brother and I received an invitation. Of course I said no, but apparently my brother is attending and is very excited. I´m not mad at him, I´m dissapointed and sad because he knows my stance in this situation and how much it hurt to see my dad in love with another woman only 5 months after our mom passed.  

Since I see this as a betrayal, I told him that I would be no longer paying for his next semester at college. He is now mad at me, which I´m not surprised about. But my husband told me that he disagrees with me and wants me to reconsider, which is making me think that I´m overreacting. AITA?",Asshole
"AITA for not acting impressed by my wife's "" accomplishment?""","My (28M) wife (26F) and I have been married for close to 7 years.

We currently have five kids together- 6M, 4M, 3F, and my wife gave birth to fraternal twins ( son and daughter) a year and a half ago.

My wife intended to graduate high school the year we got married but life got in the way. My dad had given me an investor relations type of role at his company so we were traveling a lot and then after that our kids needed our attentions. 

After our twins were born my wife was bedridden for longer than we and even the doctors expected. Since we had to hire extra hands to do the childcare tasks that involved mobility my wife had some time on her hands.

Her mother told her that her friend who proctors at a testing center said that they give GED tests basically every week ( at least across the state of Idaho) and that she should dust off her general education knowledge. She started browsing her laptop and decided to enroll in a GED prep class online.

It seems she was better at self paced learning than classroom learning because the stuff they were testing her on came way easier to her now than it did then even though she's been away from structured classroom instruction for many years now.

Even after she was back on her feet, she'd be studying for it after she dropped the older two off to their respective schools. I would see what she was studying and it looked pretty rudimentary and I knew that getting a GED basically means nothing and that she probably wouldn't be able to apply it to anything career wise, or commit full time to community college, where I doubt the job prospects for students are that great right now either.

So my wife ended up taking the test and the other day she bounded into the room and said "" Yes! I passed, I passed!""

I knew she would since she was doing well on the practice tests and the GED consistently tests on the same rudimentary topics. I did not gripe at her but merely nodded at her and went back to answering an important email from a client.

My wife seemed to get upset and I asked her what was wrong. She said I didn't seem that excited and I said that it's great that she passed but I have been telling her that it was easy and no big deal, but if she needed something to prove to herself she knew the high school concepts, I guess the money was well spent.

She got even more upset and said she worked very hard and this was the essential building blocks to being able to start a career.

AITA? My wife passed her GED test, but she wasn't exactly graduating from college and wouldn't be for at least 15 years. I just didn't see any immediate applicability to her test but I am glad she had something to challenge her while she was coming off being unable to fully care for the kids.",Asshole
AITA: For not telling my Ex-wife all my life details?,"Background: I have been separated for over a year, and my divorce has been filed but not finalized; covid still has the courts backed up in my area. This was a relationship that lasted 17 years and 13 years of marriage. We got married young and grew apart. We have three children. All were three adopted because my Ex has fertility issues and we wanted to help children in need. The divorce is amicable and we are splitting assets and child care 50/50. We have both been seeing other people, and I have had my girlfriend for a substantial amount of time

My current girlfriend (soon to be fiance once the divorce is done) is now pregnant; in the first trimester. I was trying to hold off announcing until the second trimester, but my youngest child eight-year-old figured out the secret. So, I told my three kids that my girlfriend was pregnant and had a talk about it and what that meant for our family. I did not tell my ex as i knew it would hurt her feelings. I did publicly announce through social media on Monday so that my kids had time to process it. 

On Wednesday, my ex found out, again from my youngest child, and had an emotional breakdown. She freaked out because I did not message her privately before I announced it. She dropped off our children at my house and flew to visit her family on the other side of the country. She is refusing to talk to me now because I should have notified her before telling everyone. We do follow each other on all social media, but both of us check it infrequently.

So people of Reddit am I the Asshole for not telling my ex-wife that my current girlfriend is pregnant before my friends and family?

I accept your judgment.

Edit 1 - ok so im seeing a couple people calling out my vagueness on the time line. Yes I was intentionally vague because I didn't want people being like well studies say... So let me add this. I was separated for 6 months before I started dating. Yes my girlfriend was first person I dated after divorce. We have worked for the same company for a few years, but at different sites. We only met online meetings and never in person. We met in person in July after I was already separated. I was still fighting to reconcile and she had a boyfriend. We started chatting and just went together. There was absolutely no cheating involved in this story.

Edit 2 - seeing quite a few people asking why I didn't tell her. I have moderate anxiety disorder (according to my psych) and confrontation is something I struggle with. My ex can come on a little strong, and last week  I was ejectected from my volunteer position at church until my divorce is finished. So when I announced I was hoping she would see... I didn't really think about how she would feel. Slight AH on my part or maybe my social awkwardness.

Edit 3 - I have taken the majority judgment here and sent this text to my ex. 

[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/121072i/aita_for_not_telling_my_exwife_all_my_life_details/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=4&utm_content=share_button) would like to apologize for being an asshole. The internet has spoken and the majority have voted that I was an asshole. I will keep you in the loop on major life changes in the future. 

I have been reading all your comments keep them coming. I appreciate all the NTA comments too. This conversation is definitely divided, but over 1/2 have said ITAH and I accept.

Edit 4 - seeing a lot of people struggling to grasp that I did not cheat so let me settle this. I in no shape or form cheated. I did not even talk to my current girlfriend until after divorce was filed. All we are waiting for is the final stamp. If we did not have children and property the divorce would have been finished. People who say oh they worked together. All three adults in this story are teachers. My district has over 2k employees. We work at different sites and never met in person until July at a conference. I did not even text my girlfriend until I was served papers and my ex started dating. I have never nor will I ever cheat. Everyone I know says that I am one of the most moral people they know. Discussion over no cheating physical or emotional. If anything I have feelings that she cheated on me.

Edit 5 - as a result of apologizing to my ex I got this reply: I am blocking you for now. If it is an emergency about the kids please contact my dad until I get home.

Update - ex texted me and we talked - I do think you genuinely freaked out and just mishandled the whole thing and that you are not an actual asshole. You just wear it well sometimes.",Asshole
AITA for telling my roommate that speaking a language is not a personality and she needs a new one?,"I (f19) am in my first year of college, living with a roommate, Katie (f19). Katie speaks three languages (English, German and Spanish) and she makes it her whole personality.

AITA for offering my girlfriend to sleep on the couch?,"Last year I (M23) was very depressed after losing my job, back then I adopted my emotional support dog Angel (F3) and she helped me through it all. Angel is the cutest, sweetest golden retriever and I love her to the moon and back. 4 months ago I met my girlfriend (F22) at the birthday party of a mutual friend and we instantly liked each other. I asked her out on a date and we became a couple shortly after. My girlfriend isnʼt a dog person and never really tried to befriend my dog, which hurt me a little but I thought she would eventually warm up to Angel and adore her just as much as I do.
Yesterday my girlfriend wanted to sleep over (this was the first time she slept at my apartment, we always stay the night at her place because she prefers it) when we got ready for bed, Angel followed us into the bedroom. When Iʼm sleeping at home, she always sleeps in my bed and we cuddle (she always wants me to be the little spoon :) sheʼs very protective over me) . My girlfriend was confused and asked if ""the dog"" was going to sleep in the bedroom with us. When I said yes, she made a disgusted face and said she felt uncomfortable sharing a bed with an animal and accused Angel of smelling bad. I calmly explained to her that Angel always sleeps in my bed and that itʼs our routine and that Iʼm not going to kick her out of the bedroom. I offered my girlfriend to sleep on the couch instead.

AITA for telling my girlfriend her car accident was her fault and that her driving could be better,"I (28M) have always told my girlfriend (26F) that she needs to be a better driver. She can drive but she is overly cautious, takes longer than needed to look around when parked, stops completely for a good few seconds at stop signs, keeps checking her speedometer and braking the moment she is 1mph more than the limit etc.

Yesterday she crashed the car, and claims a semi suddenly swerved into her lane as she was passing it. She lost control and hit the barrier. Luckily it was not too bad and the car is drive-able and fixable.

When she explained what happened, I told her, I knew that would happen someday and she argued saying that it ""wasn't her fault"". I told her a single vehicle collision is always your fault and that if she had not over corrected, and slowed down gently she would not have lost control or even if she had hit the truck, then it would have been their fault.

The truck did not stop.

EDIT: Seems like I am the AH, I will apologize. I really meant to say in terms of insurance. Obviously I know the truck initiated it by swerving. Usually unless an accident is really serious, police do not bother finding the other driver and if insurance does not have that info they consider you at fault in terms of deductibles and premiums.",Asshole
AITA for scolding my daughter for letting the dog run away?,"My girlfriend Sarah and I had been discussing taking a road trip for a while due to the stress we had both been under. It was my 9-year-old daughter Emily's weekend with me, so it meant she'd be coming along with us

We decided to make the trip on Emily's weekend with me, and Sarah's yorkie puppy Daisy had to come along. I informed Emily that she had to stay in the car and watch Daisy while Sarah and I made a few stops. Emily seemed to understand and was content playing on her iPad and eating snacks.

After a few stops however, Emily started acting strangely. I asked her what was the matter, and she said she was getting bored. I told her sorry hon, but she knew what she was in for for the get-go. We could all do something together later. Emily reluctantly agreed.

At one point I stopped at a gas station to buy a drink and Sarah went to use the restroom. When I returned not even 15 minutes later, the back door was wide open and Emily was crying next to the car. Daisy was gone.

Emily confessed that she was bored and wanted to get out of the car, and Daisy jumped out. Traffic was too busy for her to run after him. We drove around looking for Daisy with no luck, and Sarah was inconsolable.

I was so angry and disappointed with Emily that I couldn't even look at her. I tried to explain to her why what she had done was wrong, but she just kept crying.

The road trip was cut short and I dropped Emily back at her mom's house. Emily was really upset but I was still mad and couldn't speak to her. I was too mad to even hug her or say goodbye.

Her mom called me ""cruel and conniving,"" but I told her it was awful what Emily had done to Sarah's dog. I felt so helpless. I wanted this weekend to be good for all of us.

"AITA for ordering ""Broo-skeh-tah""?","I (40M) am an American with no Italian descent. I do quite appreciate Italian food and culture though and have visited Italy a number of times.

I went to Buca di Beppo for a family celebration (I know, not great), and I ordered the bruschetta - I said, ""we'll start with the bruschetta"" pronouncing it *broo-skeh-tah* as it is pronounced in Italian. The waitress said ""the *bruh-sheh-tuh*?"" I replied ""yes, the *broo-skeh-tah.*""

My wife (40F) said I sound like a wanker when I say *broo-skeh-tah* and that I should stop. She says the American way to say it is *bruh-sheh-tuh*, and I'm acting like a show-off. I feel like it's a no win, and it feels uncultured to just say it wrong, and that there's no such thing as an American way of saying it.

I refused to stop, and when the appetizer showed up I asked family members if they wanted me to pass the *broo-skeh-tah*, despite some of them being confused what I was even asking them.

So reddit, AITA for saying bruschetta like an Italiano?

Edit: just to build out the image, I did not say it with the kind of rhythm/emphasis an Italian would use when speaking. Just plainly like an American, but with the syllables of the Italian pronunciation.

Edit 2: It's been asked a few times, my wife did not say ""you sound like a wanker,"" that is paraphrasing, hence not directly quoted.

AITA for asking my roommate to eat in silence,"I live in a dormitory where rooms are very small and 4 people in it. In general, I don't communicate with them not because I don't like them but I like to be in my own business. One of my roommates always smack his mouth while he is eating something and I can't stand that voice. IMO, it is disrespectful and represents primal behavior. Firstly, I kindly asked him to be careful and not to make the sound. He said ok but when the time passes, he continued to do so. In the second warning, again, I kindly asked but in a serious tone. He said OK again but continued. In one of my nerveous days, he did it again and this time I shouted him with a couple of bad words. He immediately stopped and said nothing (or I didn't hear that with the effect of anger). The same day I apologized for having shouted him. He is now careful but sometimes he does unintentionally. Today again he made the noise and I warned him. This time he replied, ""Everyday you are shouting on discord while you are playing.

AITA for saying my sister doesn't have to dictate what I do in my own home after she insisted on setting the table for dinner?,"[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/user/amitheasshole970/comments/10rml3i/update_aita_for_saying_my_sister_doesnt_have_to/)

Using a throwaway,

I'm (42) the eldest of 8 siblings, this concerns my youngest sister Elina (23). Me and my husband have 2 kids (16 and 13). Elina's staying with us for 4 months because she started at a new college, and she needs some time to sort out housing. She's been here for a couple of weeks so far, last night she made dinner for everyone (she said she wanted to).

The way dinner usually works in my household is I dish up the food, then my kids take it to their rooms to eat. We obviously have family dinner too, but this is just more convenient for all of us as we don't have to spend time setting the table every day, and we can eat at different times if needed (also by different times I don't mean someone eats at 7 pm and someone eats at 3 am, just a small gap).

I know this isn't for everyone and that's okay, but this is what works for our family. Elina knows this.

So last night she made fried dumplings, orange chicken, fried rice and chocolate cake for dessert. I went into the kitchen to thank her and saw her setting the table. I told Elina she doesn't need to do that and we'll take food from the pot.

My 13 yo started saying she was hungry so I went to get food since everything was done, but Elina stopped me and said to wait a few minutes and we'll eat together. Again I told her that's not how it really works here, one of my kids is hungry now, but my 16 yo usually eats a bit later.

Elina then said she was going to serve the dumplings first, then chicken and rice and cake after. I repeated to her, again, we can get the main food at once, cake later and if anyone wants seconds we'll come and get it, it's fine, no need to set the table.

She looked upset and said she wants to have a 'nice dinner together' and 'involve the kids'. I had enough at this point so I told her I know my kids and family, she doesn't have to dictate what we do on my home. My husband saw what was going on and told Elina thanks, but we know how to serve ourselves.

Elina eventually understood but she was acting sulky, and giving me the cold shoulder this morning.

AITA for telling my son that he needs to respect his mother?,"I have a son (20M) who is studying engineering in college and as of recent has found the study material a little difficult and rightfully needs to work on. A few days ago he came home from the dorm for the weekend to cool off a little bit.

On Sunday my wife came into my son’s room and I could tell he was a little agitated trying to work on something he didn’t fully understand. My wife tried to console and reason with him but he ended up raising his voice at her telling her to leave him alone.

Then my wife just told him to pack his bags and that he’s going back to the dorm, he can’t be here if he’s going to act like this. My son tried to talk over her to shut her up but my wife wasn’t having any of it, telling him that she wouldn’t relent until he either calms down or packs his stuff, and that she will not be held emotionally hostage by my son. Then he started to call her an “overbearing b****” and all sorts of other nasty names, to which I had to bark at my son and tell him to stop right now and that be does not call my wife names or there will be problems if he doesn’t deescalate, she’s just doing what she thinks in his best interest, and he finally relented.

Later that evening my son made a comment about how he chatted with his friends who told them that my wife was in the wrong, but I had to say that they don’t feed us, they don’t pay our bills, they don’t know us, that he needs to stop consulting his echo chambers and learn to forgive his mother and forget this, as he needs to respect her for getting him where he is today and because she’s his mother. He tried to tell me that respect is a two-way street, but I said by that logic should his mom call him the nasty names that he does to her? Should we call up his grandma and tell her to cut his college funding? And if he finds someone to be annoying and getting on his nerves, what should he do? Ignore it, to which he responded with “BS, control your damn wife” and I had to disengage.

Since my son went back a couple nights ago, he’s refused to answer our calls and only responds to our texts asking us to apologise, “no ifs ands or buts,” and has told his grandma about us threatening to tell her to pull his funding, which she proceeded to give us an earful over and that she’d pay for it no matter what, and called it “really sad” if we, his own parents, would be “less proud of him than she is” by even asking to do such a thing. I can’t believe he went and told her about this, but now after what she said, I don’t know how to feel about this.",Asshole
AITA for calling my step mother big,"(Context. This takes place just after Christmas of 2022. My step-mother (28f) had struggled with a type of cancer before me and my dad met her, that had caused her to gain a lot of weight. She had made it clear that she is insecure about her weight and doesn't like talking about it due to me and her kids commonly (mostly on accident) making jokes about her weight).

 I (14m) was on a drive back from my step grandma's house. We had been in the car for a couple minutes so we decided to play I-spy. My step-brother (7m) had said he spied the biggest thing in the truck so I impulsively said my step-moms name for a quick laugh but my mom didn't like the joke (fair enough). For the next couple of minutes she doesn't say anything (that's fair). Eventually my Dad (37m, I know the age gap is kinda weird)  had asked her a question. This caused her to throw a fit about how no one in the family respected her and how her life had been worse because misogynistic men had disregarded her due to her oversized body. I obviously felt bad but I have a problem where whenever I feel sad I shut down as a coping mechanism so talking to her was very hard for me to do in the situation. 

Eventually she had calmed down and talked to me normally about how she didn't like people making fun of her in that way (fair enough) but that wasn't the problem. When she had talked about how all her life she had been put down by sexist men it made me feel like I was a bad person for making these jokes. Eventually we had gotten to her ex's house to drop off her kids so it was me alone in dads truck. I started to cry, hard as I am a very sensitive kid. Thoughts kept rushing through my head about how I was a misogynist and how i was an awful person. 

A couple minutes later my dad came back and asked me what was wrong. I was in a very bad state so I kept saying ""I didn't want to talk"" and ""Talking would only make things worse"" till my step mom arrived. My dad stepped out of the truck and asked her to talk to me as I was not talking very well to him. She got in the truck and tried to talk to me but I thought if I talked it would make things worse so I just kept saying I didn't want to talk about it. Eventually we got home and I rushed upstairs to my room where for the next day or two I would cry on and off and for the past couple of weeks I've had a feeling that I'm not a good person so I would like honest feedback just to know if I was in the wrong on this.

AITA for not wanting to pay for my girlfriend's car maintenance after I used it with permission once while pet sitting for her,"My girlfriend (28F) was traveling and asked me (30M) to stay at her place and look after her dogs. She told me I could use her car for anything I needed during my stay. She has two cars and did not specify which one. A Porsche 911 GT3 and a Toyota Camry.

I used the Camry most of the times but took the Porsche for a short road trip to a hiking trail and I hired a dog sitter that day. We did have fun with it in an empty field but nothing too extreme or going over what the car is rated for.

When she got back she noticed the Porsche was more dirty (I did not leave it extremely dirty or anything just a normal amount of dirty) and asked me if I used that car, I said I did but only once. She got upset and said that I should have known when I said car she meant only the Toyota as she always refers to the Porsche as the Porsche or the GT3. She herself only uses that car for special occasions and sometimes takes it to a track, and I thought our trip counted as a special occasion.

She got the car checked as she claimed it felt different, and came back with an incredibly expensive maintenance quote and told me I should pay for the suspension and undercarriage damage parts of the bill. I feel like she is being an AH I only used it for one day and I said I did not know maintenance was part of the deal and that I felt tricked. I offered to pay for the whole service of the Camry the next time it needs it. She got the other car knowing the maintenance is high for her hobbies and is trying to shift the maintenance cost to me.

AITA

EDIT: I did not know you could not use the car in fields (well I know but I thought one that was relatively flat would be ok if he drove slow) and my friend really wanted to try the car and pressured me to let him try it in the field even though I was reluctant but he assured me it would not cause any damage.  I will pay the bill in that case maybe even the whole bill. I could afford it and I doubt my friend would pay for it. In the first place I wanted to fetch my Subaru Outback from my place so we could store more stuff, but my friend convinced me to take the Porsche.

WIBTA if I(26F) pull my money out of my friend(27F)'s business if she starts selling shameful items like c***oms and l**e?,"English isn't my first language so I apologize for any errors.

I helped my friend start a somewhat successful night time/ odd hours grocery delivery business around some universities in my country. I managed the business for the first 6 months, personally delivered groceries at odd hours and gave her around 80% of the starting capital to get going. I have no ownership stake in the business.

I don't expect anything from her, and I did all this as a favour to her. Some people do know that I helped her.

Recently she told me that there is demand for ashame items like c\*\*\*oms, l\*\*e, p\*\*n B and t\*ys, in our city, which can't be bought easily and was planning to start delivering those items discretely.

I don't like that, I am unmarried and I don't want my name being dragged into those kinds of shameful things. My parents have started looking into marriage proposals for me, so I don't want my name being dirtied at this time. Even if my name wasn't being dragged into those kinds of things, I would still be very uncomfortable with just my money being used to deal with those kinds of things.

I immediately said no to her, but she didn't seem happy about it and wants me to reconsider.

This is all very new for me as I didn't think she would consider selling them, it has made me see her in a different light and I don't think I can continue to support her with a clear conscience.

I am tempted to ask my money back, but I feel like it will be a bad move. My initial amount is still worth about half of the companies current capital. She is also planning to persue a masters in the USA next year and she is using the money from this business to show financial for the visa. If I ask for my money back, it might be a set back to her. I really don't want to do that, but I cannot continue supporting her in good faith.

I know that if I ask for my money, it might be the end of my friendship.

Edit:

Because the amount of money was large, I gave it to her with a notorised contract to protect myself. Legally, I have the right to ask for the money. Either I can ask for it all back with a three month notice or I can ask for a schedule.

Before this, I never intended to ask for even a cent back and always intended to write it off (essentially making it into something like a gift)

I will not be asking for any money back for both our sakes.

But I made it clear to her that she should do her activities discretely so that my name would not even be marginally involved in those kinds of activities.

I also made it clear that I would not help her further.

Edit, Why I dont want my name associated with those kinds of stuff--

Gossip here travels quite fast. 

My family is a rural family, not an urban one. If any of my relatives learn that I have any kind of involvement in buying and selling those kinds of stuff, they will massively pressure my parents to disown me. Also I will be known as a loose girl in some of my my social circles. It will be very hard to get a job or even a place to rent in the same area. My marriage prospects would also be ruined.",Asshole
AITA For Not Giving my Girlfriend Money For Nothing?,"This whole story has been a drawn out event, and it needs some context. So I (31M) have been working in the business sector for a little over 7 years. It’s been paying very well, as my field (MIS/Logistics) has been growing steadily for a while now. I’ve been very particular about my finances ever since I was a teenager; I’ve always made sure to save and invest intelligently. 

A little over a year ago, I met my girlfriend. We’ll call her Sarah. Now Sarah (29F) is an incredible person. She’s been supportive and kind and loving throughout our entire relationship, and I’ve tried my hardest to return that same energy. But she had a really large issue come up in her field last month. She works in physical therapy, and her company laid her off last month. She hasn’t been smart with her money at all. I’ve tried to tell her to invest but she still only put away about 10% of her income, and she made a big investment in herself last year moving into the city, so her financial situation isn’t great. She only has a couple thousand saved up, and she had to move out of her apartment when she got laid off due to it’s ridiculous rent (1500$ a month). 

She asked me if she could move in for a bit to get back on her feet, and I begrudgingly obliged. My apartment isn’t massive, and it’s way more expensive getting food for two every night. Now it’s been over two weeks; and she still doesn’t have a job. She’s had a couple interviews, but they’ve fallen through. I asked her about when she thinks she’ll get another job, and she says it’ll probably take a bit. 

I feel like she’s taking advantage of me. To top it all off, she asked yesterday if she could borrow 100 bucks to pay off her credit card bills from earlier in the month. I told her that I’m done giving her money for free, and that she needs to get a job a soon, because it’s costing me so much keeping her in and feeding her. She started crying and said that she couldn’t believe how I was acting after how long we’ve been together. My friends think I’m being too harsh on her. AITA?

EDIT: I know 100 bucks isn’t that much money, but it’s the principle of asking me to pay off her own payments that irks me. She made those purchases, she should be responsible for them.

EDIT 2: Me and her talked again, and she couldn’t believe how I treated her. I tried again to explain myself but she just stormed off and said that we’re done. I don’t get how she could do this to me after everything we’ve gone through.",Asshole
"AITA for thinking that my sister is selfish for wanting to skip my wedding cause of her ""trauma"" ?","I (25F) am about to get married to my fiance (28M) and we already got the wedding list down, however my sister (25F, Irish twin) just rejected my invitation cause apparently she doesn't believe she can be at my wedding without her ""trauma"" being triggered.

Her husband died 6 years ago just 10 days after they got married and now my sister thinks attending another wedding would trigger all of these memories and it would be too much for her, even tho she knew her husband would die soon after their wedding cause he had late stage cancer (and that was only reason they even got married) and it was 6 years ago, so by all means she shouldn't be so traumatized that she'd avoid any and all weddings, including mine. Honestly I feel like this trauma thing is just an excuse not to come cause we've always had a rocky relationship, but c'mon now, it's my wedding, she should put that aside and support me during my biggest day. 

Also her friend called me to complain about how our family ""harassing"" my sister to come to my wedding are sending her into depression and even made her skip work, which I admit I did got my family to try to convince my sister to attend my wedding, but nobody has been harassing anyone and I feel like she's once again playing the ""depression card"" so she can get away with her unfair treatment of me, but now even my fiance is on her side and wants to leave her alone cause it's not worth it to ""bully"" anyone to come to our wedding (he also suggested me to post this here).

AITA for not wanting to be around my MIL after she had a wardrobe malfunction,"Its kind of minor I guess but I just feel like I am insane or something after this argument with my wife.

This is how it all started:

&#x200B;

My MIL (42F) was using our hot tub to help her with her back pain. I (31M) was sitting with her and she started stretching and her swimsuit top came untied. She didn't exactly rush to cover up and I saw much more than I wanted to see. She apologized but it was still really weird for me. Anyways I tell my wife (28F) about it and she just laughs it off. I mention I don't want her coming over to use the hot tub any time soon and or at least I don't want to be around her she flips out and it starts a huge fight.

&#x200B;

Edit for info and clarity:

Yes she did have my wife at age 14. She was a single mom, but my wife was really raised by her grandmother. My MIL and wife interact more like siblings/friends and less like mother and daughter. Additionally, my MIL does not treat me like a son in law even though I always try to treat her like a MIL and give her the respect that comes with it. I believe she treats me more like a friend rather than any type of maternal figure. I have known her only a couple years but she has been around a lot more to clean up the house every other week (she usually uses the hot tub when she's done to help with her back pain as I mentions in the original post). We didn't ask her to do this she offered and my wife enjoys having her around more. I personally didn't mind and appreciated the extra help, until now.

So to be clear this is the first time she has never exposed herself to me. However in the past there have been other weird stuff like her brushing her chest against me in the kitchen when reaching for things, she will wear low cut shirts when she is coming over to the house with just me there. She is very touchy, but my wife says that's how she's always been. There has been no verbal flirting whatsoever, as far as I can tell, but until now I haven't been really paying attention. I am now second-guessing previous encounters with her, but I may just be paranoid. I don't want to cut my MIL forever or anything, I just need time to reset away from her.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: After reading a lot of comments I realize I may have overreacted. I am going to try to let it be water under the bridge and do my best to pretend like it never happened. When my wife gets home, I am going to apologize and additionally apologize to my MIL for any assumptions I may have made.

AITA For Asking My Step-kid to be nice to my own kids?,"So, I(34F) got married a year ago to who we’ll call Ryan(44M). Ryan and I were together for 2 years prior to getting married. We both knew about each other's children. I have a pair of twins, and an older child (5M/F, 8M) and he has two kids, one living with their mother (15M), and one living with us (14F) who we’ll call Anna.

Anna came to live with us because she no longer wanted to deal with her mother, I’m not entirely sure what happened there. I don’t expect her to tell me any more than that. Her father and I discussed the situation, and I do not tell her what to do or treat her as my own child. 

But ever since her moving in a year ago, things haven’t been super fair to my children, nor has she been nice to them. If needed, I’ll provide a few examples, but I’m trying to stay under the word count.

Most recently, she absolutely refuses to let them play anything on the playstation and has been doing so since last year. Ryan bought her a ps5 for christmas, but when setting it up they decided that her PS4 was better and sold the ps5, so she decided to put that money aside and save up. Now, my children can’t use the ps5 because it’s sold, but they can’t use the ps4 because she refuses to let them after one incident. I did confront Ryan about this, but he argued that I said he shouldn’t get them anything tech-wise, and that the ps5 wasn’t a gift for them anyway, he didn’t decide what to do with it. I accepted that argument.

Now, I’ve been asking her to be nice and let my kids have a turn on the ps4 when she’s not using it, (which she doesn’t do much, she only plays for an hour after school on wednesdays, weekends, and whenever she has a friend over.) She said no time and time again, a few of those times her reasoning changed from, ”What if it happens again?”, to “My playstations in my room, I don’t want them in there.”, to “If they really wanna play you should buy them their own.”. And while that sounds like a great solution, I don’t see the point in buying a whole new one when there is already one they can use. So, I asked her father about it and he said that I need her permission, since it was a gift to her and her things aren’t his to have a say over.  
So, after trying time and time again, I gave up. But then she and her girlfriend went out yesterday to get coffee and buy some books. She wasn’t here so I thought it’d be fine to let my kids play, since they couldn’t bother her since she wasn’t even in her room and my kid swore he wouldn’t do what he did last time. It was going great until 4pm, and I heard my kids crying as well as screaming. I went upstairs to check, and sure enough Anna threw them out and was yelling at them. I told her to talk to them calmly then she screamed at me as well.

Nothing happened this time and nothing was broken, I personally think she overreacted, but Ryan still hasn’t talked to me and neither has Anna. My friends agree with me though, but now I’m not so sure.

AITA for asking my girlfriend to continue doing my laundry if she wants me to buy groceries.,"My gf (28F) and I (32M) have been living together for 4 years now.

She works from home since covid most of the time but sometimes does go into the office, I go to my office every day.

My girlfriend has always done our laundry together and never had a problem with it for all these years. Since she works from home, she takes care of a lot of the house work but I do help out, where I can when I get back from work although she often refuses my offers with reasons like I should wash my hands better, I do wash my hands though.

Lately she has started separating my undergarments and vests from the laundry pile and not washing them when she had no trouble doing that in the past. She that my undergarments with contaminate her clothes and wants me to do them myself in a separate load. Yet she still washes hers in the same load. I suggested we do all our undergarments in a different load and she said no because hers are cleaner and that would be worse.

She got pretty mad and made some nasty comments about my hygiene saying I should keep myself cleaner in my privates, not soil myself (I do not) and learn how to wash my hands. I do shower and I do wash my hands but maybe it is natural that men smell more idk.

I am getting pretty annoyed at being treated like I am disgusting when I am not,, I lived with my mom before her who did my laundry and never said my boxers were dirty. I said if she keeps doing this, I will stop buying the groceries she keeps telling me to bring on my commute from work and she can do that herself.

AITA For Telling My Mother In Law That I Don't Like Her Food,"My husband (23) and I (21) both come form different cultures for example I am actually an immigrat and only moved to America when I was just 12 years old.

There is alot of things my husband and his family does differently than mine, things that I'm not quite accustomed to.

One being how they prepare and season their food, to me its just super bland and the stuff the choose of food combinations just doesn't seem to go together.

For example My mil > (mother in law) puts mayo on literally everything I even seen her make a tortilla pizza as mayo as her base which she offered to me. 

Each time she offers me food I always make up some kinda excuse to avoid eating it and try to be as polite as possible about it.

But unfortunately for me after I invited her to dinner she felt compelled to do the same for me even when I told her it's not necessary.

The next day after the dinner we had together she started making plans with my husband, when my husband brought it up to me I told him I really didn't want to go to which he replied my mom's food is not that bad could you please just deal with it for one day.

Now in most cases I would've just suck it up un order to maintain a good relationship with my mil but I'm pregnant in my first trimester and am feeling extra nauseous, I honestly don't think I'd be able to keep the food down in the condition I'm in.

My husband grew up eating her good which is maybe why he doesn't think it's that bad, I mean even my family thinks so when my mom invited her over for a family get together she brought some pasta which sauce tasted like a whole package of ketchup was dump in it. 

I ended up vanting to my sisters and mom about the issue and they all give me the advice to just be honest and my mom even said that if I don't be honest now it's something I'll have to deal with for the rest of my life. 

So I decided to call her and express to her that I'm not accustomed to eating the type of foods she is use to making and since I'm pregnant it'll be really hard for me to swallow because of my nausea, I even offered to teach her the recipes from my homeland that she seemed to really enjoy.

It didn't go to well she was really offended and told me that she'll never cook for my ungrateful ass again and told my husband.

My husband is really disappointed in me because he felt like I should've just pretended to keep the peace and is upset that now my mil doesn't even want to invite me over again.

I feel super bad now and seriously want to know if I'm the asshole in this situation or if I was being too mean or disrespectful.

Am I in the wrong?


Update 

I have invited my mother in law out to a tea Cafe and spoke to her in person.

I was able to explain myself better and I choose not to back down on me not liking the type of foods she cooks.

I'm sorry but like this is my life and I'm choosing not to live the rest of my future being pressured into eating foods I do not like and am also choosing to live my relationship based on honesty.

I had an honest discussion with my mil and explained to her that I love her as a person and appreciate the time and effort she puts into making my husband and I food but I honestly do not like the type of food she chooses to make.

I explained to her that it doesn't make her any less of a person or a bad cook it's just my personal preferences.

She took it extremely well this time and apologized for insulting me and told me that she never been the best cook and would love to take me up on my offer to learn some meals from my homeland.

I ended up suggesting that we take cooking classes together and she loved the idea. 

I think the little bump in the road gave us a stronger bond and I am glad we were able to patch things up.

I personally don't think the advice I was getting from the majority of this sub was good advice and would recommend to anyone in my situation to be honest and kind.

I even made it known to my mother in law that I'd myself would appreciate the same kinda honestly coming from me and if she ever disliked food I made or even a gift I gave to please let me know so I can make or get something she'd enjoy.

AITA for trying to force my husband to sell his apartment/flat and calling it a glorified sex pad?,"We used to live in the apartment/flat my husband owned before we got married but we moved 3 years ago because I wanted our son to have more space and a garden. My husband kept the flat mostly because it’s 5 minutes from his office so he could stay there whenever he has to work extra late.

I was fine with him keeping it at first but it’s causing more headache than it’s worth at this point. My husband never spends the night even when he finishes late. Not to be tmi but the only thing we use it for is when he wants to have sex away from our kids. However, various members of our family have asked to stay there when they’re visiting. There’s currently an issue with my sister and stepsister because they both asked to use it at the same time and I’m tired of this whole situation. This isn’t the first time this has happened and I’ve told them both they can’t use it now but I feel like this is going to happen again eventually.

I suggested my husband sell it but he wouldn’t even discuss it and straight up refused. We’ve been arguing over it for a while because I think it’s pointless for us to continue holding on to it when it sits empty most of the time. I referred to the flat as a glorified sex pad which my husband was offended by. Yesterday we had a big argument over it and he told me he didn’t care if I wanted him to sell it because he wasn’t going to and we could move back in and sell the house instead if I had a problem with it.

Regardless, I'd say we've stayed decently attached to the culture-- we visit India every other summer, we speak our language, so on. But recently, I've been noticing that my sister has been attempting to distance herself from being Indian because in her words, it's uncool and Indians are negatively stereotyped. She's convinced that people don't think she's Indian because we have light-ish skin, when she obviously looks Indian, and so do I. When asked about her ethnicity, she always says something along the lines of 'I'm Indian but most people think I'm Latina, mixed, or greek/italian' (nobody thinks that), has started referring to herself by a white-sounding diminutive of her name, talks about only wanting to date white guys because Indian guys are 'unattractive', and obsessively trying to lighten her skin even further.

I don't think this is a good mindset. It would be one thing is she was never that attached to the Indian part of her identity and so doesn't identify as so, it's another that she has and is deliberately pushing it away because she feels it's uncool. That sort of mindset that being Indian is bad only leads to self-hatred, because no matter how much she changes herself externally, she'll know deep down that she's Indian, and hate herself for it. And not only is it wrong, it's obvious what she's trying to do, and I know many people find it cringe. So she's hurting herself both mentally and socially. So, today I took her aside and told her that no matter how much she tries to whitewash herself, she'll still be Indian, and everybody but her sees her that way.

She called me TA for it, but I'm just trying to look out for her. I hope she comes around eventually.",Asshole
AITA for telling my son's mom that he's staying with me while he recovers?,"My 9yo son needed hip bone osteoma surgery and his mom and I scheduled it before his three week winter break. My ex and I share 50/50 but I get him on winter breaks so she could take him our of state to see her family in the summer.

The day before the surgery she asked me if Ry could stay at her place to recover from the surgery. I asked her why and all she said was that she just wanted to be there. I said no. Ry has never had surgery and it's a big deal for him. I don't want him to think that the first thing you when you face something scary is run to your mom and not your dad.

I told her I was quite insulted by her request. Plus he was going to need help getting dressed, undressed and bathed for the first couple of days and I highly doubt that he'd be comfortable having his mom do that. She said her husband could do that.

I told her no. He's having the surgery and I'm taking him to my house when he's released. I don't care if she's in the operating room. 

She then asked if she could see him at my place and I said no. The agreement is that we have scheduled FaceTime with him when he's at the other parent's house. I don't want my ex wife in my home anymore than she wants me in hers. If the shoe was on the other foot then I'd understand whether I liked it or not. 

I held firm and things have been tense between us ever since. Personally I don't care because I'm not apologizing for not giving her what she wanted.

Edit: No, my son doesn't get to decide who he gets to stay with and when and for how long. That's why there are custody agreements.",Asshole
AITA for not inviting my daughter to dinner after she called my girlfriend a gold digger?,"I've never been particularly close with my daughter. After me and her mom divorced when she was 13 I saw her maybe once every 2-3 months and on birthdays/holidays. I do blame myself for that, after the divorce I went into a sort of mid life crisis (although I was only in my early 30s). Over the last few years I've dated quite a few women but I wouldn't class any of those relationships as ""serious"". Six months ago I started dating my current girlfriend. 

About six weeks ago I invited most of my family out to dinner (my daughter, my siblings and their partners, my parents), I felt like our relationship was at a point that I wanted to introduce her as my girlfriend to the family. And everyone seemed to like her, we had a fun dinner. But then after a few glasses of wine me and my daughter got into this small argument, I honestly don't even remember what it was about and during that argument she called my girlfriend a gold digger and left shortly after. She generally just ruined the whole dinner. 

I'm not delusional, I know one of the reasons that my girlfriend is with me is money and I assume everyone else in the family knows that too, same way one of the reasons I'm with my girlfriend are her looks. Last weekend I threw a small indoor BBQ dinner at my house and I again invited most of my family and a few friends and some of my girlfriends friends. But I didn't invite my daughter. She very obviously doesn't like my girlfriend and I didn't want a repeat of the last situation. However when my daughter found out she wasn't invited afterwards she sent me some angry messages calling me a ""selfish narcissistic prick"". And for whatever reason one of my sisters has taken her side and said I should have invited her. So was AITA for not inviting her?",Asshole
AITA for asking my daughter to cancel a hotel reservation?,"My (60F) daughter (Hailey - 37F) and her wife (Alexandra - 38F) said they were coming to visit us back home, along with their kids (13M and 11F). 

Hailey only occaionally visits here and her visits got less frequent after meeting Alexandra and ecen less after having kids, which is why our whole extended family were excited to have them here. Alexandra is generally a cold person, and doesn't get along with our family very well.

I prepared a room for them, and a separate room for their kids. I had to move a lot of furniture to accomodate their stay and I was extremely excited. My son (Harry - 40M) helped me a lot with the process, and he was also very excited to see his niece and nephew.

Their flight landed yesterday. My son came with me to pick them up from the airport and drive them home, but we realized they had arranged for a driver, and I learned then that they had also booked a hotel room for themselves. I couldn't believe it.

I talked to Hailey about this. She said she never intended to stay at home with me because she wasn't comfortable. I know she means Alexandra is the one who doesn't like to stay with us and gets uncomfortable. I said what was done was done but maybe they could cancel the hotel. Hailey said no. I asked again because I had prepared them rooms and assured it would be comfirtable. She said a hotel stay would be easier on everyone. 

I asked my grandkids if they wanted to come stay with me, but they also said they wanted to be with their moms and they said they'd come see me everyday anyway. I am honestly hurt. I told Hailey it was horrible that she had gotten so used to her luxurious life that she couldn't bear staying at her own home. She didn't answer and left to the hotel.

My son told me I was being too rough on them. I honestly feel insulted but I need an objective opinion on this. What are your thoughts?

Edit: My daughter visited me alone for the past 4 times and she stayed with me for them. The last time she visited with her family was 7 years ago and they had stayed with us then too. 

About this visit, Hailey sent me the details of their stay in email but I don't really check it so I missed it. I don't know why she didn't call to be honest",Asshole
AITA for telling my fiance that he needs to pick a new best man?,"My fiance, Kevin(M28) and I(F30) had initially planned to get married a few years ago but due to the fact that the world was falling apart we postponed it until things calmed down and our family felt safer at a big event. We've now set a date for this coming August and as we get closer more and more thoughts keep coming to me about how it should go. My biggest issue is that Kevin's best man is no longer his best man and is now his best woman. Kevin and Amy(MTF26) have been friends for a little over a decade and when they first met up until two years ago when our wedding was supposed to happen Amy identified as a man. Kevin and Amy have always had a very close almost sibling like relationship, Kevin had been kicked out by his mom at 17 and met Amy at work shortly after. She's been very close with him and he's told me multiple times that she is the closest thing he has to any family.

Initially Amy had planned to not come out to Kevin until after the wedding but after finding out that the wedding was going to be delayed she came out to him. Without consulting me Kevin told her that he was fine with all of that and that if she was at a stage were she'd like to wear a dress when our wedding happened that he would find her a dress that matched the colors he had for his groomsmen. Amy has been medically transitioning for about a year or less now and Kevin told me that we need to find her a dress. I don't have a problem with Amy and I understand how close she is to Kevin but our wedding is largely for my very traditional family. Kevin has often said that this wedding isn't that important to him and that the only reason he's doing it is because it's important to me and my family. I know that my family would have a lot of issue with Amy which Im sure would bring a lot of unwanted or outright rude attention towards her. For this reason I've asked my fiance to choose someone else to be his best man and request that Amy attend as just a guest. This has lead to a large fight between the two of us with Kevin threatening to cancel the wedding if Amy can't be part of the wedding party because he wants someone from his family in it. Im trying to get him to understand the issues this will cause but I'm not sure he gets it. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for not turning my alarm off so my BF can sleep?,"Me and my BF moved in together a few months ago. Our apartment is one bedroom and we have a couch.

I set an alarm for 6.30 so I can try go for a run with my friends. It's not possible for us to do this another time, unless it's at night.

BF's job doesn't have standard hours, right now he has 2 days each classified as morning, afternoon and overnight shifts, and day 7 is off. My alarm doesn't usually clash with anything because he's either already up or at work by then.

So now he has afternoon shifts twice a week. By the time he gets home from those and sleeps it's 12 or 1.

The issue now is my alarm wakes him up at 6.30. Tried a vibrating one but it's useless for me. I said he can go back to sleep after, but BF's reply is that it's hard for him to go back to sleep if he's woken up like this and he needs to rest, and I don't get up. He wants me to turn the alarm off entirely.

I don't think this is fair because this is my routine, and I suggested he sleep on the couch those nights but he refused to.

AITA for telling my brother to get over it after I let my ex in his house so he could see our sick son?,"I don’t want to go too much into detail but I’m divorcing my ex. It’s been messy and I’ve been living with my brother as he helped me leave him. My brother used to be friends with my ex so the divorce has been rough for him too and I think he’s been focusing on his anger so he doesn’t have to accept that my ex hurt him too.

My son was sick and he kept asking for his dad so I asked my ex to come and see him. My brother was out when he came over but my sister-in-law was home and she kept telling me he wouldn’t like it when he found out. I think she called him because he came home early and he knew before he even saw my ex. He told my ex to get out of his house and to stay away from me and forget he had a son. My ex refused but I made him go as their arguing was upsetting my son.

Once he left and my son had calmed down, my brother turned his anger on me. He thinks I’m insane for asking my ex to come and see our son as he thinks I need to stay away from him until our divorce is finalized. He told me he didn’t want him in his house again and wouldn’t budge when I reminded him he’s still my son’s father. I was frustrated so I told him he needed to get over it because I did what was best for my son in the moment.

AITA for accusing my sister of lying about being lesbian?,"My sister was always a tomboy and she made it clear very young that she is into girls. She didn't even have to come out, as she has been talking about her girl crushes since middle school.

She has a really close best friend, Ben, who was always allowed to come over and even sleep at our house, because our parents viewed him as just a friend. Meanwhile I was never allowed to have boys over. Their relationship was always a bit suspicious to me, because they were always very close physically, play wrestling with each other and such.

She is 19 now, attending the same college as Ben and they even live together as ""roommates"". She came home last weekend and announced that Ben and her are dating now. Our parents were really surprised, but they didn't say anything.

I pulled her aside to ask what's up. I see two options: 1) She is not into Ben, but suddenly decided to use him as a beard and go back to the closet for some mysterious reason. 2) She was always into him and they had been secretly dating all this time, and she purposefully lied to our parents to be able to spend more time with Ben.

She said that she didn't lie, she needed time to figure out her sexuality and coming to terms with her bisexuality when everyone treated her like a lesbian since she was 8 didn't make it easy for her. She also said that if I have a problem with our parents not letting me have boys over, I need to take it up with them, not her.

Then she treated me like shit the whole rest of the weekend. I think asking her what's going on was an absolutely fair question and her reaction is over the board. But on the other hand, I'm straight and I have no clue how it is to grow up openly lesbian/closetedly bi. AITA?",Asshole
AITA for leaving my inlaws christmas dinner after I found out that they didn't make accommodations for me?,"



I got invited to my fiance's family christmas celebratory dinner. It's my first christmas with them. I have always been picky about what I eat. Can't help it and it has to do with psychological factors, childhood, and personal likes and dislikes. Before accepting their invite I let FMIL know that I wouldn't be eating the traditional food at their celebration, and showed her a variety of dishes to choose from to accommodate me. She refused and told me to bring my own dish. I said if I had to bring my own dish when I'm a guest then I better stay at home then. We went back and forth and I insisted I wouldn't come if accommodations weren't being made. I just thought it was a simple request and FMIL could've agreed if she really wanted me there. My fiance agreed that I shhould bring my own dish but I didn't.


When we arrived there and I saw that no accommodations were made I got up, go my things and walked out and went home. My FMIL and fiance were shocked. I got tons of calls and texts from them both and my fiance came home lashing out calling me selfish and spoiled to walk out like that over a dish that his mom didn't have to make for me. and, that it was my responsibilty to feed myself. How is it my responsibilty to feed myself when I'm a guest? Makes no sense to me. I told him this and he accused me of starting shit and ruining my first christmas with his family and disrespecting his mom.



Now he's continuelly saying I fucked up and should've sucked it up for the family's sake.


ETA to clear few points:


* For those saying I have no respect for my inlaws. I do, especially FMIL. I respect her but this is so far the biggest conflict we had.


* I work long hours even on holidays so not much time to cook.


* I wasn't asking for an elaborated dish or several dishes. Just one simple option.",Asshole
AITA for showing up to my husband's Dr appointment?,"
My husband has been dealing with sone health issues the past few weeks and has been frequently visiting the dr. I asked if I could go with him but he refused saying it wouldn't be neccesary and when I asked why he wouldn't want me with him he said he felt more comfortable having privacy with his doctor. I jokingly asked if his doctor was a women and he glanced at me.


I anticipated his next dr appointment and decided to go meet him there. He went and 10 minutes later I entered the office (I identified myself as his wife) and he was shocked when he saw me. I greeted his doctor (a man lol) and we talked but my husband refused to even look my way and refused to speak as well.


We left the office together and he went off on me in the car saying I shouldn't have ""followed"" him and came into the dr office after he asked me for some privacy. I said it was alright I'm his wife I already even know what his issues are and just wanted to show support. He said I overstepped his one boundary and refused to respect his wish and made him more stressed than he already is in these hard times he's going through.

AITA for prioritizing my wedding and picking my extended family over my sister?,"We come from a large religious family of first generation immigrants. When my sister came out to them, they cut her off and they both mutually decided to go no contact with each other. I obviously disagree with what my parents did but they’re stubborn and set in their ways. I still invite my sister to any events I hold, against my parent’s wishes, and they’ve eventually accepted it but just ignore her while she’s there.

My fiancé and I want to get married in our home country where all our extended family lives. My sister is angry because she says I’m choosing my extended family over her because they all disowned her once they found out and she wouldn’t be comfortable at the wedding (also in my home country, it’s illegal to be openly gay). We don’t have much family here and my fiancé and I want to have a cultural wedding back home with all our family and friends there.

AITA for telling my brother he can't stay committed to his late wife forever and he needs to move on?,"My brother is 36, was widowered at 22. He married at 19. His late wife is the only woman he was ever with. They had two children together a girl and a boy. Both kids were tiny when their mother died. 14 years later my brother has never dated, has spoken about wanting nobody else, how nobody could ever compare to his wife and generally rejects any chance to see if a spark could happen with another woman. At first I figured he was focused on his kids and would find a way forward to find love again in time. But four years after his wife died it became clear he was not interested and was outright adamant he would not move on. I heard that he had turned down several women. And has continued to do so over the years. Even offers to spend time as friends and see if more happens.

It feels like he's dedicated to remaining a widower for the rest of his life. I worry so much about him and so do his friends and the rest of our family. 

I have asked him before why he doesn't try to find some companionship and he says he doesn't want it. That he's a married man and that has not changed for him. He told me he swore as long as he lived and that's a promise he wants to keep.

His kids are now older and have grown used to it being just them. They see it as so romantic and nice that their dad loves only their mom and never wanted someone else. 

It worries me and recently I brought up the subject that he deserved to find someone to love again. He told me no, that I need to stay out of his business, that we all do. I told him we worry about his loneliness when the kids move out and start their own lives. He said he doesn't worry about that because he has more to his life than just work and raising his kids. He also said he was committed to his wife and that's his choice. I told him he can't stay committed like that to his late wife forever and he needs to move on with his life. He told me it's not my decision and kicked me out.

AITA for not lying to my boyfriend about my Match Day?,"So I (M28) and my boyfriend (M32) have been together for four years. Our relationship has been amazing except for when we have special occasions or gatherings. He is a really sensitive and emotional type to the point that it gets awkward and embarrassing. Match Day is a Day when Med students find out where they will do their residency. I’ve been extremely stressed because I was hoping for my first choice and didn’t need any extra stressors. My boyfriend asked what time the event that my program was hosting to reveal the match day results and I just knew he would be over the top with emotion and cause me embarrassment so I lied and told him a time well after I’d find out. Match day was Friday and I got my first choice. My boyfriend arrived an hour before the event ended and was visibly upset with me. He went home after and won’t return my calls. AITA?

 EDIT: Thank you everyone who has commented and gave me advice. I’d like to preface by saying I love my boyfriend and know what I did was shitty and could have been avoided by a conversation. That being said he did text saying he wants to talk. I’ll update when I can.

AITA for yelling at my brother asking him to have some f*cking emphaty towards me?,"My life hasn't been going that great recently. I left my husband 2 months ago and I've been miserable since. I left him, because I had a crush on another man and that made me question our entire relationship and myself too.

I started dating my husband when I was 17 and I fell in love with his kindness. He was my first boyfriend ever and he showed me care I've never received from a man before. Long story short, I've left him after almost 10 years of being together, because I started questioning *why* I've fallen in love with him. I had an emotionally abusive father growing up and I never went to therapy and never tried to process that. I just tucked it away and got married to a man, who was the complete opposite of him and a people pleaser.

Upon leaving my husband, I moved back in with my mother (father is dead now) and my little brother and now I hate my life and miss my husband terribly. I have to commute 3 hours a day to work and my mother and brother are much more difficult roommates than my husband was. My brother especially is frustrated by my presence and constantly picks up fights. 

Yesterday he was yelling at me through the door about taking too long in the bathroom and I told him to calm down and don't be such an asshole. He asked when will I finally move out, because I'm always in the way and told me I was an idiot for leaving my husband and I should go and beg him to take me back, but he probably won't, because I'm impossible to live with.

I snapped and I yelled at him asking him to have some fucking emphaty for me, I'm going through a hard time and I really don't need him to be such an asshole to me. He replied that it's not his problem, I created this situation for myself and it's not fair that he has to suffer the consequences of my actions too and I don't deserve his empathy.

He is right that it's all my fault, I created this situation, I only got myself to blame. AITA for yelling at him?


Edit for info:

My brother is 22 and his problem is basically just me being there. Not that I'm messy, or loud, just that I'm present. He likes to send our mother away for the night to her boyfriend when he wants to have company over and it really bothers him that he can't really send me away like that. 

Also, I didn't leave my husband for the other guy, I stopped talking to that man as soon as I realized I have a crush. More info can be found in my comments about this.",Asshole
AITA for agreeing to buy a house with my sister without telling my husband first?,"My sister asked me if I wanted to buy a house together as she wants to own a property before marrying her fiancé. It’s something we discussed often after we graduated and I still think it’s a good idea for us to buy something together for multiple reasons so I said yes.

We looked at a few properties online just to get an idea about what we both liked but we haven’t done anything else to actually buy a house besides discussing it. 

Her fiancé found out and he was angry about it so he called my husband and completely exaggerated the entire situation. I was going to tell my husband myself eventually but he’s upset with me because he had to find out from somebody else. We keep fighting over it even though I don’t think this is something worth fighting about as I was always going to tell him before we got serious about buying anything and he’s the one who always says it would be good for me to have my own assets.

AITA for asking my girlfriend to leave the house for 6-7 hours a day?,"Throwaway because girlfriend is a Redditor. I (24M) am Canadian and have been in the US for 10 months, where I have been living with my American girlfriend (25F) for 7 of them. My time in the US is almost up, and I'm stressing about having to return to Canada. For one, my family is reliant on me to make money to support my grandma and pay for her medical support. I also want to earn money to give my girlfriend, she deserves the world. Because I have so many side hustles going on to earn money, I admittedly don't spend a lot of time with my girlfriend, but I've always been open with her that I am not able to give her a lot of attention right now even though I love her more than anything.

My girlfriend lost her job last month, and as a result has been at the house more often. We live in a one bedroom and split the rent evenly. She understands that I'm busy all day/night, but I don't like when she's sitting in the same room as me. Even her presence is distracting to me, she will try to start conversations and she's not the cleanest, so I would ask her to go to the bedroom for the day while I worked in the living room at my desktop. She was ok with that for a few weeks, but began to complain that she was stuck in the bedroom. She says that since she's paying half the rent, she has every right to be where she wants to be in the house. I agree. So, after a few big fights, we agreed she would leave the house during the day and I would leave the house at night. Well, now she's upset that she's spending all day out of the house. Her car was in an accident last month and has been in the shop, so she's been going to do work in the boba shop by our house. Before anyone asks, I am not able to do the work I do during the day outside of the house, which is why I leave in the evening.

Today, my friend was over and was sitting on the couch, where my girlfriend usually eats lunch. I say couch, but it's really an oversized loveseat. My girlfriend went to go sit in her usual spot to eat lunch, but I asked her if she could eat in the kitchen instead so she would have more room to eat. She went to the kitchen, but I could tell she was pissed. When I asked her if everything was ok, she said she was tired of me controlling her. I think she's being selfish and not considering that I need a certain environment to concentrate and get work done, and that I am doing all of this for her and my family and one day I will be able to spend all the time in the world with her, but that right now I am really grinding and most strong relationships are built on sacrifice.

WIBTA for not inviting my poly friend's partners to my wedding?,"I (25F) am getting married in September. My husband, Mike and I are doing a big wedding for 250 guests. I've always dreamed of having a storybook wedding. I asked my best friend Marissa (25F) to be my MOH and she happily agreed. She's been a huge help to me in every step of planning the wedding. 

Marissa is in a poly relationship and she has 3 partners. Greg (24M), Brandon (27M) and Ace (22NB). She's been with Greg for 5 years and was the first partner she had. They added Brandon and Ace over the course of their relationship with Ace being the newest member. They all date each other and seem to be happy. I don't really ""get"" it if I'm being honest but it's not my business. 

However the issue came into play when Mike (32M) pulled me aside and said while he loves Marissa he didn't feel like spending the wedding explaining her love life to his family. Which I understand, they are very conservative and hardly accept LGBT people as is let alone a LGBT polyset. I had already reserved 4 spots of Marissa & co but my husband suggested he invite a few coworkers to take the partners spot and Marissa could come alone. I didn't want to ruin his big day so I agreed reluctantly. 

I know I should have told Marissa from the get go but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. So when invite went out she called me up immediately and asked why she didn't have a plus 3 invite. I explained to her exactly what I said above and she just said ""oh"" and hung up. 

Next thing I know Brandon is calling me and begging me to reconsider saying they promise they won't act like they are in a relationship but they want to be there for me. Except I can hear Greg in the background telling him tell me to fuck off and that I'm am asshole and he doesn't even want to go. I explain to Brandon that I already gave their ""spots"" to Mike's coworkers. Brandon says okay thank you and hangs up. Marissa texts me the next day saying she isn't coming unless they can go. 

Mike said he can't uninvite his co-workers now so it's not his problem. I told him I would add them and pay the costs and he just said if I want to spend the whole time explaining their relationship to people than so be it but he isn't wasting his time doing it and will just send people my way. 

Our other friends think I'm an asshole but Mike's friend and a few of my non mutual friends don't think i am. Just want some more unbiased opinions.

Edit: I am the asshole, that's for sure. I followed a lot of advice in this post and asked Mike what he thinks in the morning. He said to talk to Marissa first and see what she wants and we'll make it work. I also had him read over the post himself and he said that a lot of the comments opened his eyes on how he himself was coming off. So we both decided to call Marissa together and beg for forgiveness. 

We called her and she was happy to talk. We explained our side of things but acknowledged that it was a massive fuck up and could have been handled so much better. We invited her and her partners, obviously and said we would be happy to whatever it takes to have them forgive us. She asked her partners about it and Brandon and Greg both agreed they would prefer to just ""split"" the set up. So Greg and Marissa would be a couple for the wedding and Brandon and Ace would be a couple. They however would need to talk to Ace first (they were at work) and that they would get back to me. So that's where we currently stand.

Edit2: I never told Marissa I was inviting her partners, I just had a list of invites with Mike. I'm still the asshole but wanted to explain that.

Last edit: Ace got out of work a few hours ago and we all got on speaker phone and had a long conversation with this post pulled up. The crew was all happy to be defended but did think people went a little harder than they would have even Greg. He actually laughed at me calling him self absorbed because he is lol. Anyway. We're all good :) they are coming. They gave permission to tell Mike's parents. We called them after and they understood but said don't let Nanni know or she'll be asking questions all night.

AITA for refusing to clean my room on a Saturday,"I (16f) live with my mom (47f). We have always had very different ways of living. I prefer to let things get really messy and then clean them up and she prefers to clean as she goes. As a high school student taking a couple of advanced classes, my week can get pretty stressful, and I figured out early in the year that I need something to look forward to during the week, aka what I call a ""rest day,"" where I do absolutely nothing all day but read, watch TV, and eat snacks. Right now, this day is a Saturday, as I have school during the week and work on Sundays. My mom has never understood this. Today (saturday) I agreed to do a couple of small chores but stopped there. Earlier, she asked me to clean off my dresser and bed, a task that would take at least an hour, so I politely told her that today is my rest day and I'm not doing it. Also, my neck and arm are really hurting because i apparently did something while doing another chore, so I wasn't having it. She got pissy and said that it wouldn't take me that long and I should just do it. I told her no, repeating that i need one day a week to just decompress and do nothing. She then started yelling that then I need to pick a day to do cleaning. I decided on Wednesday as that is normally my most free day of the week. She then started lecturing me that she doesn't want to hear me complain come Wednesday. A few hours later she saw me on the couch watching a movie while she was mopping and said ""You know, I was planning on doing some of that cleaning together, but if you do it later, then it's just going to be you."" She then started lecturing me again about how she doesn't get a rest day and kept muttering under her breath and trying to get me to do it today.

So, AITA for refusing?

Edit: I think some people got the wrong idea so I'll try to clear things up. Firstly, when I say stuff is on my bed, I mean the back of my bed like on the headboard. There is a built in shelf. I don't eat in my room, so there is no food or dishes sitting out (mold is one of my biggest pet peeves), my room absolutely doesn't smell, and there is nothing on the floor.

My mom and I made the arrangement of rest days months ago when I realized my mental health was in decline. I needed something to look forward to. My mom supported this decision. Because of this, I do more schoolwork and chores during the week.

The reason I ESTIMATED it would take an hour for me to finish is because a lot of the general clutter on my desk doesn't have a place to go. I have a bunch of books up there, and my bookshelf is full. Where do they go? I have some souvenirs from camp and my desk is full. Where do they go? Hopefully you can see the reason this would give me a lot of anxiety. I also had no idea that my room bothered my mom so much.

Lastly, I don't completely disregard the rules of the household. If I make something for lunch, I clean it up, regardless of what day it is. If it is Saturday and my mom asks me to take out the trash or do some other small chore that will take less than 5 minutes, I'm in. And for those of you who are curious, the clutter has not spread out of my room. Hopefully I gave some more context here.

UPDATE: So its Wednesday now so I thought I'd give an update. My mom and I devised a system where she gives me my chores for the week on Monday, and I'll get them done by Friday evening. This way I can space them out with tests and homework. (This is in addition to my regular chores like feeding the dogs, setting the table etc.) I did clean my room today (took about 30 minutes). In total, I did 3 of the 6 things on the list. I'll do the other 3 either tonight or tomorrow. How long this system will last is anyone's guess, but it seems like a good fit right now.",Asshole
AITAH for telling my daughter shes too old to be sitting on my lap?,"I (37f) am married to my husband (38m) and we have a daughter together (11f). 

My daughter is very small for her age and as a result gets treated like a younger child sometimes. 

She loves to hop in my or my husbsnds lap and cuddle with us on the couch or in a chair.

I have been thinking that she may be too old for that sort of thing and maybe I'm hurting her by letting her continue. 

Yesterday she tried to hop in my lap and cuddle and I told her she was too old for that and to get off me. She got really upset, got off me and went to her room and slammed the door. 

She hasnt tried to get in my lap since then and things are tense between us. She doesnt talk to me unless she has to and when I hugged her goodnight last night she didnt hug me back. 

I feel really guilty because I obviously hurt her feelings but I feel like she might be too old for sitting on my lap.

AITA for asking for my money back after I was kicked out of a wedding?,"| (32F) have been married to my husband Owen (35M) for nine years and we have an adopted son named Mikey who is seven years old. We are a close-knit family, but tensions have risen recently due to my sister Hope's (34F) wedding earlier this week. 

Hope is the golden child in our family and has always received preferential treatment. She requested that there would be no children at the wedding, which made my son Mikey upset because he loves his auntie. Despite this, we respected her wishes and attended the wedding.

However, things took a turn when my brother Vince's (who has a child with Down syndrome named Frank) friend's house caught on fire and Vince had to bring Frank to the wedding as 
an emergency. My husband was understandably upset that Mikey couldnt attend while Frank was allowed to, and this led to an argument between us and my sister. 

Words were exchanged, and we were asked to leave the wedding. My husband is now asking for our share of the money back that we put towards the event. However, my parents are siding with my sister and saying its our fault for causing a scene and getting kicked out.  I feel as we did nothing wrong and acted accordingly",Asshole
AITA for insisting my son not be called by a nickname?,"Posting with a throwaway account...

So my (36F) 8yo son's name is Michael - there isn't a ton of history in my family regarding the name or anything, I just liked the way it sounded when I was picking out baby names when I was pregnant. As he's been getting older, other people have started to call him ""Mike"", but I don't like it, so I try to correct people whenever I can. For the record, I've asked Michael about this, and he said he doesn't really care.

I went to a parent-teacher conference the recently, and the teacher kept referring to him as ""Mike,"" even after I'd corrected him at the beginning of the meeting. I was complaining to my partner about it, who didn't think it was a big deal, but I wasn't happy that my wishes were basically being ignored. My partner then said it was ridiculous to insist on Michael never going by a nickname his entire life, and that it's a losing battle. I said it would be nice to have some support from him on this, and he looked at me like I was crazy... I told him I wasn't going to back down on this, and that if he were more open to correcting people too, then it would be more likely to stick.

He said I'm being overdramatic, and that I can't control what other people do. I got upset with him, and we agreed to stop talking about it and collect our thoughts before discussing it again at a later point so things wouldn't escalate into a fight. 

Some of my friends also think I'm being a controlling AH, while others are saying that my partner is being really unsupportive. I understand that my partner thinks this is a trivial thing, but in some ways that upsets me even more, as I would hope he would be able to see that this is something that matters to me and would be willing to have my back.

WIBTA the A-hole for confronting my guest/friend for opening and using new beauty products (kind of expensive) from the bathroom without asking me?,"I (F,24) had a friend stay over for the New years eve overnight to New years day. I let her use my bathroom and in the bathroom I had my night routine beauty products on the counter in the back corner. Glycolic peels, some serums and thick cream moisturizer in a small container for the body but, it was expensive so, I would only use it for my face.  When I went to use the bathroom later that evening I saw that the toner and the moisture was opened, not even closed properly and the seels were opened and on the counter next to it..my counter is clean as I just cleaned it and I don't have much on there. They were new just bought a couple weeks ago and I didn't open the toner yet and I opened the moisture but only used a little from the top without denting it(it was a thick moisturizer I use for dry skin on my face). 

The thing is, it was not too expensive and was decently priced where even I was careful not to use too much at a time and I had only used it once since I bought it. Well, when I went the first time I didn't really care if she used it. I was fine, it's just a toner and moisturizer. It's okay. I was fine with the toner although I thought it was a bit weird to open a new product at someone else's house without asking. If she asked ""hey, can I use the toner and moisturizer? I'd be sure go ahead"" but she didn't ask me and just opened the new one on the counter.the problem wasn't she used it, even if it was moderately expensive, it was she opens a new product without asking me. 

Anyway, for the moisture she literally put her entire finger in there and took a huge amount her finger indent was all the way to the bottom of the container. Again, I wouldn't have minded if she just used a little bit even if it was new and barely used. When I saw that I was like, did she really just use this? Why would you use some new product on the counter that's not yours I don't understand? I was pissed because it was expensive and I didn't even use much like a little dab from the top and she had her whole finger in there. As a person with ADHD and OCD I also used the products by just swiping on the top little my little so it doesn't look too uneven. I don't ever just stick my finger in the container and now I can't use it because it bothers me...with the whole she made in the middle of it. I guess I could mix it around and make it flat again. But still it was perfectly flat before. 

Would I be the A-hole for telling her it was wrong for her to do and she should ask before opening and using a new product at friends house. Again, if she just asked me can I use these I would say yes, and use a little of the cream that was all. I know i may be overreacting but I just would not do that if I was at a guest house.... Maybe I should have put them somewhere else but I just didn't think she would use so much of it. Please let me know",Not the A-hole
AITA; Am I the A-hole for not wanting my mom to be apart of my new life?,"Am I the a-hole for not wanting to have my own mother in my life? I am 22 years old, I was raised by my grandmother quite literally since I was born. My mother was always the party type/crazy girl of her school. She had me in her very early teens and was not ready to become a mother. She never wanted anything to do with me, only came to some birthday parties of mine but always brought her male friends over. When I turned 16 years old (pretty much when I could start working and get a job) she started to come apart of my life and even insisted on me getting a job at that age. I refused because I wanted to be a child still due to every summer I spent with her I was taking care of her/my step fathers kids. I technically can say I raised 4 kids who weren’t mine. I don’t know why I went back every summer hoping my mother would actually appreciate me and actually show me some affection. I was wrong and went home early every single summer when I was disappointed. Anyway, I’m now 22, had gotten a job at 20, I moved out after a harsh screaming match with my mom over the job I worked. I moved in with my current boyfriends family. His mom was a bit much for me to handle so I had no choice but to move back in with her due to these 2020’s times hitting and it was definitely hard to find a place. It still is and I’m currently trying to find a new job while working a job I can’t stand. Which I am not gonna complain about, money is money. I have been spending time with my brothers and sister(who my mom said she’d replace me with) and anytime I hang out with them for more than an hour my mom calls them upstairs to play with their single rat she got for them even though I’d be hanging out with one of my brothers and the others play with the rat 24/7. I’m in counseling due to trauma abuse from my mom and family so I’m learning to find out more on what I want from life and trying to fix my life. She is always trying to have me help her with “money issues” even though she buys Amazon stuff every other week and even her husband is trying to cut her off of Amazon for a bit. I know I’m jabbing here, but sometimes I feel every detail counts. I know I’m not a perfect person, no one is.

AITA Is Friend the A-Hole For the Situation Or the Roommate?,"This is a friend of mine and we’re curious if they are the A-hole or the roommate is in this. I’m just the messenger and relaying this story...so don’t shoot the messenger please. 

So S (friend) decided to help their friend (E) out who has a rough home life and BPD. S offers to be her roomie since she needs a place to live and can’t qualify for an apartment alone. S does all the leg work for the apartment, all the calls and paperwork. They started out as long distance buds and when it came time to do apartment interviews, they agreed to spend the weekend hanging as a kind of pre move in thing. S drove 4 hours to visit E who spent the entire day in a discord call with a guy (T) she was interested in who had told her he did not want a relationship. S asks about it and she says “misunderstanding” so S agrees to a 3-way call with her and T. After a few minutes T starts yelling, talking down to S who gets upset. S hits a dresser loud enough to be heard via mic and says “You ignored me all day with this call and I agreed to talk to clear this up and you have yelled and been mean? Not fair.” E yells at S for being upset but not T. 

Back home, S apologizes for the outburst and the 2 continue planning with no issues. S gets the U-haul and takes care of the entire move and buys furniture for common areas. Three days before the move, S wanted to call and talk to E. She says she can’t because T called, but will make it up. Next night S asks “hey can we talk now?” E says yes but a minute in, there’s another call and will make it up to you. Night three, more excuses. When S points this out, E’s response was “Well I can’t do calls”

First week in the apartment, E is fine until the internet gets hooked up and now she’s in calls with her group or T constantly. After a week S mentions “hey it sucks, you went from I can’t do calls to calls EVERY second” E says that she realized they help emotionally. S asked how that magically happened. E makes excuses. S asks about a couple hours one day out of the month they either chill with just them or some friends and game or something. E freaks out saying that would be a strain on her new relationship with T (what?).

Now E refuses to talk to S outside discord. E calls S a friend but ignores him for everyone else. Her reason is “Ever since the incident with the call I have been scared but I couldn’t bring myself to tell you.” So now after weeks of trying to let E figure it out, the solution is for her to stay and S to leave, but we’re not sure how (she claims dad). E tells S“I just can’t get over the fear even though you have shown nothing but kindness.” S said “I can’t trust you so since I cannot be removed from the lease I want to break the lease and pay the fees.” to legally cover their butt. S doesn’t make the 3x rent to qualify for an apartment but makes just barely too much for income restricted so E is forcing them to move out of state after 5 years of living there and fighting not to have to go back to a bad family.",Not the A-hole
AITA / Are we the A-Holes for not tipping our limo driver?,"I was at a bachelor's party last night in Los Angeles.  We had decided to rent a limo for the night which would take us on a tour to 3 different breweries in LA.  There were 7 of us altogether with ages ranging from late 30's to mid 40's.  The tour started off great and we were all having a good time celebrating our friends last night out before his wedding.    We all had fun but none of us were disrespectful, caused any damage, or broke the law in any way.  We had a couple of beers at the brewery but none of us were ""drunk"". The driver was also respectful and the service was average.  The problem came when there was a miscommunication on how many hours we had booked the limo for.  The driver had it listed as four hours and we had it prepaid for 5.  We did not want to make a scene or cause any trouble so we had the driver take us back to the hotel which killed the mood for the night.  When we arrived at the hotel, everyone was understandably disappointed that our night was cut short.  We said our thank you' s to the driver anyway, and it was at this point when the driver demanded that we tip.  The driver said we had caused them extra work to clean because we left a ""Big Mess"".  There was no trash can in the limo (that we saw) and we did leave behind some empty water bottles and cans in the cup holders, but that was it.  We did not bring any food into the limo and there were no stains left on the seats or anything like that either.  What we left behind could have been removed in less than a minute.

AITA the A-Hole for pressuring my dad to sell me his guitar?,"My dad and I both play guitar religiously. He builds, buys, and sells guitars. He does a lot more of the first 2 than the third. He has somewhere in the region of 50 guitars in his house, with far more in bits.

We were recently cleaning out some of the rooms and found stuff that would make anyone drool. Pickups, necks, bodies, whole instruments buried in the piles.

He is really weird about selling things to me. Anytime I express an interest in something, he's sold it by the next time I go to see him. This would be fine, but it's always literally the only item he'll sell. Me touching something of his is like a guarantee that it'll be on the market. 

I think it has something to do with the fact that he sells them for more than he buys them for, doesn't want to lose the potential profit, and doesn't want to make money off me.

Now here's where I think I may be being an a-hole. Recently I've become nervous about him selling/moding a specific guitar. It's a strat build that is honestly one of the best I've ever played or heard. He modded it, against my wishes, then admitted he made it worse and that I was right.

I began asking him how much it's worth to him, and he said it's only £250. This will be the resale price as he's likely got it for near nothing. I asked him if I could buy it, to which he said a firm no. I asked why I couldn't, and he wont give an answer. I offered to trade him stuff equal to it's value, but he wont take that either. I asked him just not to sell it, and that the other items are worth far more, and he brushes off the comment.

It's becoming a regular point of discussion and I can tell it makes him weirdly uncomfortable. It's happened like this so many times, I'm getting nervous that the next time I see him he'll have sold it. He never uses it, and plans to sell it like all the others. Even guitars he uses he'll sell for the right price, so it's not a sentimental thing.

I feel that I'm just making things awkward by pushing the subject, but I don't see why he'll sell it to strangers but not me. It's devolved into me bringing it up and him ignoring the fact I mentioned it.

It's the first time I've ever really pushed on anything like this, and I really wanted some opinions before pushing further.

As a driver you may get a fine of £500 and three penalty points for not wearing your seat belt. If you are carrying a child under 14 without the proper restraint you are liable for a fine of £500 and three penalty points.

So if I’m driving and I see children without ear belts on, I tell the driver/passenger. Am i the asshole or should I just leave it? I don’t scream/shout, just tug at my seat belt and point at kid. Wind down the window if they don’t understand. 

Generally it’s been ok apart from this one family. Their kid was standing between the partners (both wearing seat belts). So I actually did my horn and pulled at my seat belt and pointed at the kid. He didn’t understand so I wound down my window and said seatbelt. The father was really dismissive and didn’t tell the kid to put on the seat belt.

AITA - Is my mother the a-hole for not cleaning when she doesn't work?,"Since I don't know where else to post this, you all get to hear about this wonderful problem of mine and well it's more like it's my mothers and her hubby's problem.

So I (F19) live with my mother (F36) and her hubby (M38), they have a great relationship but as all everyone does sometimes they fight. But the thing is that her hubby tends to went to me after such a fight and right of the bat I know that he shouldn't do that. But he thinks that she is an a-hole for saying, ""Why don't you help around a bit more at home?""Let me set this up for you to understand a bit more, my mother has a job and works the night shift there. But that also means she gets a lot of time off her job because such is the law where I live. Her hubby, however, works an 8-5 job five days a week along with an extra job on the side, though that job his him being a caretaker for his father. He asked apparently why she hadn't cleaned up something because she should clean everything up by herself. So then she asked that question and wondered why he doesn't help around more. My mother doesn't like fighting too much and left home at some point to cool down. I wasn't home most of the time for when this went down so when I came home naturally I asked where she was, the answer I got was, ""She ran out somewhere and doesn't answer her phone after we fought. I asked her why she hadn't cleaned up this thing and then she started saying things like, well why do I have to be the one cleaning up you should clean up too. But I work five days a week and she doesn't. She gets to be home ten days in a row when I have to work every single day and I helped everyone with everything (He thinks that him helping his friends and driving to the store to buy food for some reason is helping everyone in our home with everything), so I shouldn't have to clean up but she should do it since she's always home."" I can agree with that yes maybe she could clean up a bit when she is at home but I don't think that him working an 8-5 job entitles him to not cleaning up in his own home. I do my best to help as much as I can at home but now school has started again so I focus more on that than cleaning spaces in a house I only use one room in when there are other's who can clean as well. So Reddit what do you think? I can't tell them anything without getting lectured myself but I do hope that some of you people here can help me.

Edit: My mother works from 9 pm to 7 am for max three to four nights in a row before she legally where we live can't work without taking a few days off from work. Her schedule is different every month and even I rarely know when she works until she leaves for work.

I also want to say that I do help out at home as much as I can when I don't have to prioritise my school work.

Edit 2: Feel like I want to make another thing clear before I go to bed, but I don't use schoolwork as an excuse to not help around at home even if it must have seemed that way it's not. The agreement I have and always have had is that I take care of my room, help with the dishes and clean the foyer and occasionally I'll take one of the bathrooms though that's fairly rare. I have never seen my mother as a made but her hubby thinks she should do all the housework, such as cleaning, cooking food and doing the laundry while he gets home from his job and lays on the couch for the time he spends at home unless they go the to store to buy groceries or he is helping a friend out or anything alike. I feel like we all have somehow managed to get used to being lazy enough for this to even become a problem and I really do see that is a problem in itself. Thank you all who have replied to this so far, it's helped me if anything and made me see things from a different perspective. ",Not the A-hole
AITA? Am I the a**hole for telling my mom she has to choose between me and her biological grandchild or her step daughter and her kid?," For context I (23F) my mom (42F) have generally always gotten along. She married my step dad (45M) about 14 years ago. He has 3 kids (24 F, 22M, and 20F) my mom has 2 kids (23 F and 19 F). Me and my sister were never a priority in our house. We always came last to my step siblings. All of my step sibling have kids and I am currently 25 week pregnant with my first. I do not live with my mom. I am married and living on my own even tho it’s only a few blocks away from my moms house. My oldest step sister has hated me for about a year now. We would get in fights just like regular sisters do but I got tired of me always apologizing just because she wouldn’t let me or my mom see my niece (5F) until I apologized. I didn’t want to be the reason my mom didn’t get to see her granddaughter. Now my step sister refuses to come around to anything I will be at. Family functions, our parents house, christmases, thanksgiving, anything. My step dad told me I couldn’t go to 3 of my grandparents houses for Christmas because she wanted to go. I didn’t fight back because I don’t want to be the reason my grandmas don’t get to see my niece. The other day I was at my moms house and her and my step dad told me to leave because they wanted my step sister and niece to come over and I wasn’t allowed over. I had been there for hours at that point. If they had come to talk to me and told me that they wanted to come over it would be a different story. But they just kicked me out, no warning, nothing. I don’t want to separate the family and I want my child to have the opportunity to play with their cousins and no have to deal with tension from family members and not have to deal with being told they have to leave because someone else wants to come over. I don’t know what to do anymore because I know I have to do what’s going to make my child happy in the long run. So am I the a**hole?


So sorry. Forgot to mention why we were fighting. She wanted me to help her get a house and a car. I told her I could co-sign for a car but as I’m only 23yo I couldn’t get approved to go-sign on a house. She accused me of hiding money and saying that I own my house. I do not own my house. I’m and renting from a friend. She said that if I didn’t give her $30,000 for a down payment she would tell our parents and I told her to go ahead and tell them because I would not be giving her that much money. She has always been petty like this and when someone doesn’t give her exactly what she wants. She. Goes. Crazy.


*UPDATE*

So sorry I know I left out some details. I had just gotten out a fight with my mom and step sister before I made this post and needed somewhere to vent and get advice.

My bio sister has been low contact with all of our step siblings and parents for about 2 years now. She saw all the crap that was going on our whole lives and she felt that she didn’t want to be around any of it anymore. And I don’t blame her. As for the other step siblings, they all think I am in the wrong for not giving her $30k. They think because I am married and have a husband that we have all this money we can throw away when that is not the case. They aren’t as bad as the oldest and they do talk to me some but we don’t see each other very often.

As for me not being invited to family function and everything else, as far as my side of the family is concerned, they know me and step sister had a huge fight and my parents have told them that I don’t want to come around anymore. Which isn’t true at all. I’ve tried talking to my grandparents about it but they aren’t listening. 

Growing up my bio parents divorced when I was 7 and I spent weekends at my dads house. My mother would take the child support my dad sent for me and my sister and used it to pay for things my step siblings needed. I had to get a job at 14 to pay for clothes, food, phone, sports gear, and anything I needed for school. At 16 I had to get a loan from a bank to buy my first car while the child support my dad was sending was used to pay step sisters car payments after my mom paid for half her car upfront. I was forced to move out at 18 while my step siblings got to live in the house rent free, job free, and got everything paid for by our parents. While I was 2 months behind on rent from having Covid and my grandma and step mom passing away my parents told me I was on my own. I didn’t even ask them for help, I was just ranting to my mom about it. After meeting my husband at 19, he helped me get back on my feet and helped me manage living on my own without feeling overwhelmed. He is supporting whatever decision I make. We don’t get any financial help from my parents, sibling, or grandparents. 

My step dad is the bread winner of their family and brings in all the money. My mom thinks she can’t speak out against him or he takes all the money away. My step sister has since made a death threat to me and my baby because I told my mom she had to choose. I have blocked her on everything and will not talk to her anymore.

I want to go see her asap. (We're actually pretty close, closer than her and my hubby). Hubby said it would be easier to go by himself and take a plane there. Mind you, I have already called the kids' schools to let them know we will be going soon for about a week to visit. Just in case things turn for the worse. He is saying there isn't a point of all of us plus the dog going all the way up there. There's 5 of us, me, him, 2 teenagers, and a 5yr old, and a small puppy (who's potty trained btw) . I tell him no way, that we all are going. He keeps insisting that Just he goes. He says it's because he doesn't want the kids to remember her like that. BUT, he is not taking into consideration my feelings at all. I told him he is being selfish and inconsiderate of what I want. I want to see her asap, before it's too late. Well, now he's sent me like 4 messages as to why it's better for him to just go by himself.. I don't know what to do right now. Am I the A-hole in this situation?",Not the A-hole
AITA/ I hired my own seamstress. Now the bride is angry with me. Am I the a-hole?,"My brother is getting married in August. His fiancée asked me to be in her bridal party. Weddings aren’t my thing but I said yes because my brother wanted me there. All the bridesmaids meet, we get a list of expectations from the bride. The dress has been decided on. The bride made it clear once our wedding shoes came and we had our dresses, she would provide us the contact info of the seamstress she wanted us to use. I received my things first because I ordered them first and tried to get the seamstress info especially because, though I ordered my dress two sizes larger, I couldn’t zip it up. I measured myself three times before I placed the order. I still never got a response from the bride or her moh about the seamstress. Time is running low and I have a critical issue with my dress so I find a seamstress on my own after three weeks of looking (no one had space). I go for my fitting and the seamstress I hired explained that my dress issue is not my fault but that of the dress company as she has had to fix several with the issue of not being able to zip. The fix is to change the structure of the dress which will change the uniformity of look. I tell the bride this with the understanding that is this change won’t work with her vision, I can be replaced, not a problem. She proceeds to yell at me about seeing someone with consulting her( I tried since March when I had everything in hand) and I want to quit because I have gained weight and don’t have the money. Then after she finishes yelling she demands I get the dress back and have her moh trade dresses with me. Her MOH is six inches taller than I am and has a bigger bust. My brother told me I’m the only person whose dress is with a seamstress. Now I don’t want to be involved at all. Was I wrong for hiring a seamstress on my own after the radio silence from the bride and moh?",Not the A-hole
AITA - Is my mother the a**hole for being mad at my brother and SIL ?,"Sorry upfront, English is not my native language and this is my first time posting here. 

For some context: 

My (22f) brother (27m) has always been very entiteld and coleric. Everytime someone of us visits him he flips for no reason and my SIL (23f) isn't better. She has always been very demanding and mean (a could give so many examples for their behavior but i want to keep it short here). My mother (58f) is a very kind person and alwalys wanted to have a good relationship with me and my brother. She has always been there for bove of us and does everything if my brother asks for something (even does things and nice gestures without been ask for). I distanced myself from my brother a year ago because of his treatment and temper but my mother mostly ignores it to keep the peace and to have contact with them and my niece (2 years old) (family is very importent for her).

To the story: 

Recently my mother visited my brother and SIL to drink a coffee together after her work. She always calls before she comes around to ask if it's okay for her to come by. After my mother had her coffee, my niece would drag her out of the room to play with her grandma. When my mother left the room they thought she couldn't hear them (they didn't even closed the door) and my SIL told my brother that he's always in a bad mood everytime our mother visits them. That has really hurt my mother. This was the first time she had heard them talking about her behind her back (we knew they were doing it, but hearing it directly is different). Now my mother doesn't know how to deal with it. Should she continue to visit them or would it be best to keep her distance. Since I've already distanced myself from my brother and SIL and I don't put up with their BS anymore, I don't have an objective opinion on this and so my mother asked me to post this here. 

What do you think Reddit would be best to do?


Update: Thanks to eveyone for your good advices. It helped my mother a lot and she thanks you all very kindly. She is now considering how to proceed, since my brother's behavior has not improved, not even on Mother's Day. Thank you all for taking the time 😊",Not the A-hole
AITA am i the a hole for telling my stepmom to stop giving my food away if its being wasted?,"I 15(m) have stepmom(38) and step sister (4) dad(38)  I eat cereal in the morning almost on a daily basis and dont eat until dinner or if i make a lunch so typically i only have breakfast. Stepmom has work in the morning so she leaves with SS typically after i eat breakfast she usally makes step sister cereal no problem. BUT she likes asking her and she will say cinnamon toast crunch which is my faviroite ceral and i buy it for myself since she buys step sister ruity pebbles which i dont eat. I dont have a problem with her having some but she gives her adult sized proportions and she never finishes them and usally says shes full so it goes to waste ive asked to her to buy some for herself but she says why when she can have some of yours. I tell her most if it goes to waste and i can barely get any before its basically gone so i tell her either get more than 1 box or to stop giving her any because its ridicoulous that i cant get through a school week without needing t get cereal again.

AITA:am I the a**hole when I want to call my birth mother by her name?,"When I was born my mother had postpartum depression because my birth father got her pregnant and 2 months after her older sister,my grandparents raised me and I call them mom and dad,my birth mother lived always near us or with us but my birth parents has favorites (it's not me).I grow up calling them by there names with ma and pa and I'm not close with my siblings from either side even is there living with us my older sister and younger sister(mothers side)are mean and always gets me in trouble.I was calling my birth father by his name without pa for over more than half a year and wanted to do the same with my birth mother because she is more like an older sister that wants to rule your life but my family doesn't want me to do it (I'm 16 almost 17 years old) but I want to know am I the a**hole",Not the A-hole
AITA : am i the a..hole for yelling at my parents?,"so firstly, i’m a minor, and i identity as bisexual. or bi romantic? i haven’t had any sexual interaction because well... i’m a minor 😐 but i know for a fact that i like women, men, and everything in between like non binary, genderfluid, etc Romantically. i don’t care what your genetics are or what your gender is i’ll fall in love with who you are not what you are. 

but my parents have different views than i do. 

i’ve tried to come out a few years ago since that’s when i realized i liked girls, and my parents flipped out at me telling me i’m straight and i don’t know what i was talking about. (i spent months researching on the topic before i even told myself i liked girls romantically cause i wanted to understand it first) so they shut me down and i gave up, few months later the topic of lgbt came up and my mom brought up what i said and out of fear of getting yelled at again i brushed it off by saying it was a phase.

for some context, for the past 6 months or so i met a group of people online that shared the interest of watching the same anime show. we all watched a volleyball anime. and throughout that i made friends from that group, and one of them we’ll call A. A is non binary, and them and i flirt a lot. (and i caught feelings.) over the past month or two we’ve actually brought up the topic seriously now and then and after being asked by our friend group if we were dating, we both answered that we wanted to meet each other in person before deciding we want to date seriously. (so for now it’s just playful flirting and ‘i love you’ s.)

now my mistake was that i wasn’t careful and let my little brother overhear me talking about A with other friends on the phone. and the little sh-t stain that he is, he told my mom. today i had a doctors appointment and was told that i should consider seeing a councillor, because my doctor was worried for my mental health. i took my doctors advice because well, they’re the professional. once i got home and told my parents about this they flipped. they started yelling at me asking why i need a councillor cause i wasn’t depressed, (i’m not. but when did i say i was?) i was perfectly healthy, why i don’t tell them when stuff is bothering me (i don’t feel comfortable with them so i have my own safe space)

my mom then proceeded to ask me if it was about me liking the same gender and told me it was bullsh-t that someone my age could like the same gender. i know it wasn’t the best choice to make but i yelled at them that that wasn’t the only thing upsetting me and told them they should shut up and stop making decisions about my life and that they can’t expect me to meet their expectations perfectly. 

i know i shouldn’t have said what i did, and yes they’re entitled to make decisions about my life because i’m under 18 and they legally have to, but AITA for yelling at them instead of agreeing?",Not the A-hole
"WIBTA, or should I ask, Would WE be the A-Holes, if we travel cross country to see elderly grandparents and leave behind a family member behind?","Using a throwaway account, for anonymity reasons. May have a slightly confusing title, I apologize and I'll elaborate here. My (M23) mom and my sister were thinking about doing a road trip this summer to see my grandparents (Mom's parents) and other family members and celebrate graduations, birthdays, etc. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen issues that came about at the start of the year, my dad would not be able to go with us, and when my mom mentioned the idea to him, he became very upset, and started claiming multiple things that aren't true, and created multiple assumptions regarding the intentions of this trip. He said that we always wanted to neglect him on family vacations and that we hadn't gone on one in ""17 years,"" which isn't remotely true. In short, he thinks we're trying to purposefully go without him, and even though my mom has explained it multiple times that he has nothing to do her wanting this trip, he insists we're doing it to hurt him. My mom's parents are not in great health, and for me, this trip could be the last time that I get to see them, which is my incentive for going. I would love for my dad to be able to go on the trip with us, we all would, and I feel really bad that he wouldn't be able to go. So, I guess the question is, would we be the bootyholes to go on this trip, leaving my dad at home?  


TL;DR Mom wants to take a road trip cross country, myself and sister would accompany her, my dad can't go and is very upset about it, claiming we're only doing it to abandon him.",Not the A-hole
AITA You offer me too many and I am the A-hole?," I don't see how I was an a-hole here, but maybe I am wrong and a complete a-hole.

This  happened when I was eight years old. My aunt, cousin and me went to a  movie. My aunt bought some candy, she bought Twizzlers. I eat Twizzlers  slowly, I like to break them down the middle while in my mouth and suck  the taste out of them before chewing and swallowing.

During  the movie my aunt offers me one and I start do what I do when consuming  Twizzlers. Half way thru finishing the first one, she offers me another  one and I take it. I am just about to finish the first one and she  offers me another one, I don't take one and she starts to shake the bag  in annoyance, so I take another one. This goes on till I have six  Twizzlers in one hand, and the one I am eating in the other hand.

At  six Twizzlers my eight year old hand is filled to capacity, aunt wants  me to take another one. I look at aunt and say I can't take another one  because no more will fit in my hand. Aunt looks over and sees that I  have six and angrily says give those to me. I comply and give aunt the  Twizzlers, she then tells me I am a pig and will get no more.

I  really don't see what I did wrong here, when I felt I had to many and  didn't take one the bag would get shaken in annoyance. So I took them  till my hand was full. When my hand was full I spoke up because I didn't  want to get the bag shaken at me.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my mom she was the a**hole for telling my grandfather off when he turned off the music?,"For clarification, this is more or less for my mother and grandfather but the bot didn't let me post it unless I had AITA in it. 

I am a F(24) and my friend is F(25). I had her over for a week because she lives far away and I live with my grandparents because of college. My grandfather(76) and my mother(52) have always been butting heads with each other since she was in her 20's. One day, my mom came over to hang out and my grandparents went next door to chat with the neighbors. We have an echo speaker that we tend to use for music and we got it for my grandfather for Christmas. It was his but he rarely uses it. So my mom turns it on to listen to music in the kitchen with us. Too add to it, she was also drinking alcohol and tends to get judgemental. I had my hair dyed and went to wash it off in the bathroom. 

That is when everything went down. 

Apparently, my grandfather came into the kitchen and turned down the music where you had to basically strain your ears to hear it. My mom was p***ed and told him ""We were listening to that!"" 

My GF: ""It was too loud, this is my house!"" 

Mom: ""You're an a**hole!"" 

GF: ""F*** you!""

That's how to conversation basically went according to my friend. She was put right in the middle of it too. She and my mom went outside to listen to music instead. 

My mom says to my friend ""Don't listen to him, he's an A**hole!"" 

Then my friend goes inside to get a drink where my grandfather was making dinner. 

My GF says to my friend. ""Don't listen to her, she's an asshole."" 

I finally come out after drying my hair and hear what all went down. I'm furiously that they both argued in front of my friend and made her uncomfortable. The whole ordeal went away until I brought it up again recently. 

My mom was over and I told her how my friend was uncomfortable and how she was out of line for telling my grandfather off when he lowered the volume. She got really mad and starting saying stuff about how men shouldn't be the only ones in charge of the house and that they were listening to music. He just barged in and turned it off while they were listening without asking. She also stated that she didn't care that my friend was uncomfortable and that she will always argue against my grandfather because he is a massive sexist (very true). How she is a strong woman and won't let a man win. I tried explaining to her that it was his house and his property but she just didn't quite get that. My friend also agrees with me in this matter. 

I just want to know who is the a**hole here, my mother or my grandfather? I say both are the a**hole here but my mother more than my grandfather. He is an a**hole by himself but its this incident that he may not be one. 

Thanks for reading. 
TLDR; Grandfather turned off music in his house on his speaker and mother didn't like it. They got argued and called each other a**holes. My friend was in the middle of it and I got mad.",Not the A-hole
AITA? Am I (14M) the a**hole for raising my voice at my (39F) mom after she yelled at me for something ridiculous?,"I live in a lower middle-class family, with my sister, mom, dad, two cats, and a dog. My mom has a job with the state and is a very hard worker. She raised us two kids for 7 years while our immigration papers were pending, and while my dad was working in the States to save for our flight & move in.  Anyway, fast forward to today, I have just started high (online) school (yay.) and was finished for the day, all my homework was done and 3/4 of us were just chilling on the couch. Eventually, my mom asked who a person was on her Facebook (it was the dean of the middle school I used to go to.) Now, at the same exact time, my sister asked me which episode of show XYZ I wanted to see next. I decided to answer my sister’s question by shrugging rather fast and saying that IDK. My mom started shouting at me for “twitching”. I don’t know if she thought that twitching (even though I didn’t) gave you Tourette’s or something but I assumed that, so I told her that I didn’t twitch. But she just kept yelling for another 10 seconds before abruptly, and in a holier-than-thou tone asked me: “You still haven’t told me who this person is! WHO IS IT?” I was still quite annoyed, so I told her, a little louder this time, “Ms. Quintin, the MIDDLE. SCHOOL. DEAN.” She. Lost. Her. Marbles. She started to yell at me for screaming at her like a lunatic and “YOUR GENERATION HAS NO RESPECT!!!1! and “YOUR ELECTRONIC DEVICES MADE YOU THIS WAY1!!!! My sister, who was there the whole time, told my mom that I haven’t even raised my voice and that SHE was the one who was being unreasonable. Being defeated, my mom pulled the  “BRING YOUR DEVICES DOWNSTAIRS, NOW! GO TO YOUR ROOM, NNNNOOOOOOOOWWWW!” card. I got to keep my iPad so that I can have an alarm to wake up, but I still feel guilty for losing respect from the woman that raised me and cared for me. Both my sister and my dad say that mom was in the wrong on that one, but I would like to hear from you, Reddit. What do you think about this one?

AITA...more like is our company the a**hole?,"So this isn’t so much about myself but a policy our company has that I kind of understand but also seems kind of mean to me. 
Background: I work at a restaurant that offers an all you can eat buffet style salad bar with the entree. 

We used to have a couple (at least early 50s probably older) come in quite regularly and do the same thing every time they came in. The wife would order an entree with the salad bar, and then husband would eat the entree and she would eat the buffet, but he also ate the buffet. Essentially feeding two people on one meal. It isn’t uncommon for parents to get the salad bar and share dessert with their little ones or some fruit or whatever for the family, so sharing salad bar isn’t uncommon. 

It wasn’t that the people were unable to pay for the meal, I don’t think, since before we caught on they would tip their server nicely. I think it could be just that one of them was unable finish all of the meal (not unusual for our more elderly clientele) and weren’t in the habit of eating leftovers, we don’t really know what the deal was. But once we noticed they did it every time they came in I think the manager caught on and said they weren’t allowed to do that, and that they would have to pay for another salad bar since the husband and wife both ate the salad bar. 

Well, they would then get angry about having to pay for the other buffet. And they would refuse to do so. There would always be a threat of calling the cops, they would pay without tipping, and throw nasty words around. But they still continued to come in and try the same thing over and over again. 

Personally I think if the husband didn’t also eat the buffet it would have been fine, but since he did it was an issue? But the buffet is all you can eat so was there really an issue? I think with how lax we are with salad bar sharing in other circumstances it shouldn’t be such a huge deal but maybe it’s just me? All in all, is the restaurant the a**hole?",Not the A-hole
AITA I use my in game currency on myself and i'm the a hole,"Me = OP

AITA for telling my Uncle he’s an A-hole in front of the whole family?,"Update- I just apologised to UL, however he didn’t accept it. He says that he “Hardly” gets around and to be “embarrassed” like that “really put him off” for coming to as many family events. I’m really angry as I wanted to just do the right thing and apologise but now he is making everything seem like he’s not wrong and I’m the A-hole. My parents grounded me for a week after the incident but now for a further 3 weeks when the found out UL didn’t accept it. Well I don’t know what to do now and I’m furious with him.





I’m on mobile so sorry if there’s bad formatting 
I’m a (17M) and an only child and I have a pretty big nose, it’s something I’ve come to terms it’s nothing I can do to help it it’s just a part of me, however since people love jabbing at it I copped a fair few nick names that I didn’t like, the biggest one being “Proboscis” as in Probosics monkey, I won’t go an explain what that means but give it a google and it’ll make sense. It’s an inside joke with some of my close friends and I just go with it because I don’t want to make my close friends who all poke fun at each other’s appearances feel like dicks if I told them how I truly felt about it so I just roll with it.

My whole family knows about the nicknames and how self conscious I am about it so usually they just act like they don’t know about the nicknames and stuff and don’t crack jokes about it which IMO is the right thing to do as I like no not be reminded of my nose. I don’t get angry and meltdown when people poke fun at all, I’m known to laugh along with occasionally but at the back of my head it sometimes kinda hurts.

Anyway in celebration of the recent lockdown being lifted my family threw a little party with our closest family members coming over to see how everyone is laddie daddie da the basic stuff. However we have this one close uncle called “Uncle Larry” and to put it simply he’s our family’s sugar daddy, ages ago he invested in bitcoin and made a huge return and now he’s the one everyone wants to be on the good side of for obvious reasons, in fact my family we particularly suckers for him because he’s the one who paid for half of our house which is pretty big mind you. 

Anyhow at the party everything was going smooth UL was making some mediocre jokes that everyone thought was some top notch shit, but after cake when the adults were talking a little quieter UL poke fun at my nose, being a UL joke people laughed and I’ll admit it was pretty funny and I laughed a bit but I was kinda embarrassed because I’d been pretty lowkey the whole time because I was the only person below the age of 30 there and was mainly on my phone but still made small talk with relatives who I hadn’t seen in a while, so being put in the spotlight was pretty uncomfortable, anyways since he got such a great response in his last comment he made another one but each steeped a little lower and dug a little deeper until he got to the whole “proboscis monkey” thing, he pulled a couple monkey faces and I was clearly not laughing anymore and I was kinda like “It’s not really that funny anymore” to which UL responded with a “aww don’t be a buzzkill we’re having a good time” to which I flipped and said “Yeah well I’m not asshole” and stormed off, idk but the way he talked made him sound like an arrogant jock from all the 90’s movies.

AITA for leaving my babies inside by themselves,"I (20) am a mother of triplets whom are only 2 months old. I never expected ever in my life that I'd be a mother to triplets so when I first became pregnant it was definitely the last thing in my mind. 

I'm home with my babies all day long and had to even transfer my education to online. 

Sometimes I just need some fresh air especially when I can't get them to stop crying and I find myself getting super frustrated to the point of tears, it's honestly soo hard and the dad isn't here to help as he's ether at work or at school.
My fiance's (24) parents rented us a main floor apartment so when I step outside I'm literally just sitting on the chair right beside the door plus I have a baby monitor step up in their room and it has a camera on it I can literally see them and hear them so if anything happened I'd be able to quickly get to them. 

Being able to step outside for a few minutes to take a breather is really important to me because I start to have mini panic attacks when I can't get them to stop crying and I get really frustrated because I just feel super overwhelmed, Being able to go outside just gives me a chance to clam down. 

My fiance came home to me sitting outside while the babies were crying and freaked out on me calling me a horrible mom and a bunch of other names that I'm not gonna list here. He thinks that I was being super neglectful and putting the babies in harm way and even told his parents and now everyone seem to be really against me. 

I grow up in the system my fiance's family is the only family I have and ever known so it breaks my hurt that they are so upset with me but I really don't think I was doing anything wrong or putting my babies in harm way but they seems to think otherwise.

So here I am wondering if I should apologize for my actions or if I am the A-hole in this situation.

~~~~~~~~~ Update ~~~~~~~~~

I decided to show my fiance this thread at first he was really upset with me for sharing our personal problems with strangers on the internet even though it's anonymous. 

But in the end when he had a chance to clam down and hear me and all of you guys out he actually apologized and promised me he'd be more involved with parenting and even is willing to take parenting classes which I'll hold him to that. 

I just wanna thank everyone for the support that you all give me it brought tears to my eyes (happy tears) seeing how supportive you all were to a stranger on the internet I don't think I ever received this much support before.

AITA for saying no to buying a house?,"AITA? Or am I being logical

Me (F22) and my boyfriend (M20) are trying to move out in the upcoming months. We are steadily having an argument about which is better. I have a child who is 2, he is not the father but has been in his life since he was 6 months. I believe renting is easier for my situation and would help ease my mind that we are actually capable living with each other. I have moved out before my son was born, it was a terrible experience. Because I could not live with his father after a while, he was gross, abusive and all the other stuff. I just want to make sure we could handle a monthly payment rather than making a 30 year commitment to someone I’ve only been with for two years. 

His reasoning for buying a house is that it is a waste of money to rent. It’s all money going down the drain and he believes it is “a stupid idea, I want a house”. At first he didn’t think it was stupid until his mom said he would have enough to by a house by himself. I agree that renting can be a waste of money, but it insures that you can do it right. I have a kid so it weighs heavy if I “F” up. 

Am I the A-hole because I’m not trusting him?Am I the a-hole because I’m not able able to convey to him my point? Or should I let him move out, become a roommate and go from there?

I understand the wasting money trust me, but for me it’s not about the money.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not wanting to attend my uncle's engagement party due to him marrying the girl he cheated on his wife with,"Sorry for any typos, english isn't my first language

I (14m) recently had an argument with my uncle (52m) over not wanting to go out to dinner with him, his fiance and some other family members. The reason as to why I didn't want to go is because his fiance knowingly dated a married man (aka my uncle), and my uncle cheated on his wife for 20+ years, and neither of them seem to show any remorse  
His previous wife (aka my aunt) is a great woman and I have nothing but high praise to say about her, she is one of the nicest people I have met and the affair absolutely broke her, she lived with me and my mom for a while so I tried to comfort her as much as I could, she is currently doing fine and has contact with the family but obviously avoids my uncle  
The main issue happened earlier today, my uncle (who I try to avoid as much as I can) came to my house while I was home alone to drop off some invitations for his engagement party, I said thank you and that I would give them to my mom when she got back and I tried to close the door but he stopped me and let himself in, I was annoyed but I figured he wouldn't be long  
He started telling me about the party while I was washing dishes in the kitchen and he brought up a dress code he had established and asked me what I was planning on wearing  
I decided to be honest and say I wasn't going, I told him that based off my personal moral standard him and his girlfriend are not people I want to talk to  
When I said this he exploded and called me a moody teenage brat, I did my best to keep my composure but I did exchange some insults with him and called his girlfriend cheap

WIBTA if I told my sister I will kick her out if she continues to take my stuff?,"This is going to be a mess so I apologise beforehand. 

Context: My sister (23) and I (26F) live in an apartment together now. In total, we've been living together for about 5 years. Last year she was living with her boyfriend, but due to whatever reasons, she moved back with me. When she lived with him, she still had a key to the apartment and most of her stuff was still here, making me unable to use the room or the space. She didn't pay any sort of rent, even though I told her it isn't fair and that she should at least pay for something since she's using space. 

Now she moved back, she quit her previous job without any sort of savings and she told me she can't contribute to the household bills due to it. She is at this new job for about 3 weeks now, which is great! 

I was okay and understanding with the fact money is tight due to her quitting, she's my younger sister after all. I can't lie however and must say that at least I expected her to keep the place clean. As in, clean after yourself, leave the things where you found them... And most importantly, not to take stuff that doesn't belong to her, which is my biggest gripe and the cause of my main frustration.

This has been an ongoing issue with her for as long as I can remember. The conversation is always the same. Can you please not take my stuff, especially without my permission? 'Yes, of course, sorry.' A couple of weeks pass by and guess what... The same thing happens again. And I am parroting the same thing again to get the same treatment.

Yet again, I could not find a piece of clothing (some sports leggings) that belongs to me. She did not say anything about it and the only way she could have gotten access to it is by entering my room when I'm not home. I purposely made it difficult to find, yet she still found it, which means she took her time rummaging through my stuff.

Because I always know where I put my stuff, I knew she took it. So today, as she left for work, I went ahead and did something I don't usually do. I went through her stuff in her room and... I found my leggings, dirty on top of everything.

I am quite livid... I feel like I am putting up with a lot of her antics and this has reached a critical point for me. I intend to confront her about it when she comes back from work and flat out tell her that if she takes anything from me ever again, I will pack her stuff and tell her to move out.

I understand this might sound petty, especially for people that are a-ok with sharing clothes etc but that was never me, it was always a boundary. Would I be the a-hole if I told her that I would kick her out?

TLDR: adult sister is taking my belongings without my permission despite asking her not to numerous times.

INFO: I'm not renting, I am a homeowner in theory. In practice, this apartment was paid in full by our parents when we moved to the capital with our studies. The contract is in my name. They supported us with bills until we got some proper full time jobs after our studies. So right now all that is to be paid are bills, pretty much. I paid for bills in full for almost 2 years.",Not the A-hole
AITA for blocking my parents from visiting my younger son unless they agree to treat my younger and older son equally?,"I had adopted my older son [7M] about 4 years ago after practically being the only ""dad"" he had around for another 2 years before that. Wife's ex was a POS who left her pregnant and struggling.  For all intents and purposes he is my son, and well he knows about his sperm donor but in his own words, ""that man is nasty, I can't believe he could ever be my father."" 


My parents were less than thrilled that I married a woman who had a child, but (at least I thought) they had adjusted in a short while, and when I adopted him, they also jumped into the role of grandparents. And things were pretty normal for about 3-4 years. 


Wife and I had our second child this year, and at the time of announcing the pregnancy, my mom made an underhanded comment to me in person ""I'm glad you finally saw sense and decided to have your own child."" I rebuked her quite hard and stated that I'm not going to tolerate any favoritism towards their biological grandchild in front of me, or my children. That she is free to think whatever she wants but she cannot state it to me, or my wife, or my children ever. 


Well, my parents didn't comply. It started with stuff like forgetting to get my older son a gift when they came to visit, to when outright a while back when we went out for a meal during their Christmas visit, parents stated IN FRONT OF MY OLDER SON, that my wife should pay the tab for her son. To avoid creating a scene right there, I went and paid the entire tab and paid for a cab to take them home, as I didn't want them to be in the same car as me and my wife. 


After we all got back home, I told them that they are free to use their room till their flight day but they should not expect any kind of service from my wife (she handles most of the food) and that they cannot see either of my children. It got me quite an outrage from my extended family, and for the time being I'm myself being low contact with them because the restaurant incident had pissed me off. They also attempted to pick my child up from daycare but I gave strict instructions to not hand our baby to anybody but my wife or me, so it worked out and they left within 3 days. 


My brother is on mom-dad's side. I got comments from the trio where they said ""We should've NEVER let you marry her,"" as if it was upto them at all. Being the younger son truly sucks. Anyways, I am currently low contact will all family, and have laid out 3 strict conditions to allow visits again: ""1. A proper apology to my wife, 2. A proper apology to my elder son and 3. NEVER showing any kind of open favoritism again, this includes either buying gifts for them both while visiting or don't buy gifts at all, never making my elder kid feel like they aren't his grandparents, etc."" 


Extended family and my brother make me feel like the a-hole for, in their words ""putting a kid who is not even his child before his parents."" So AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for treating my little sister the same way she treats me?,"So to start things off my household has always been peaceful besides the few arguments here and there ( we usually talk it out and apologies or made to apologies if someone goes to far, on purpose  or by accident by our dad) My household contains me, my little sister, my little brother and our father. My siblings used to live with our mother about a year ago but wanted to live with us due to certain issues. My father, sister and I all have jobs.

Now....for a few months my dad and i have been trying to get my younger siblings to help us out with house chores, bins, gardening, washing and wiping up etc. So far since my dad works all week and tries to get somethings done on weekend while still trying to have down time, my little brother does schoolwork, the bin and wipe up, my sister works whenever she is offered a shift and nothing else. I currently cant work due to car being out of order. Now I've always been taught to never be lazy and not to leave a todays job for tomorrow and not to be a slacker. So since I've been home a lot, I've been doing everything.....and when i say everything, I mean everything. From simple chores to driving my sister to work on weekends (with dad's car)  and to the point I've been doing their laundry for my dad and sister. And I'll admit that I am someone that doesn't like asking for help (and yes i know that can be unhealthy, I am working on it)

Hence me asking for help as of late. Dad asked if i could tackle the weeding out the back since we are getting a new fence put up soon and he will take care of everything else. I said sure and went and asked my siblings for help when i noticed it was a bit. now this is when things went south. My brother and I ended up doing the entire garden ourselves and my sister sat in her room reading doing nothing. Reminder, she does nothing around the house even before when i was working, only pays bills. So i had enough, I immediately stopped making her dinners or lunches when she wasn't working, i stopped doing her laundry for her, I stopped giving her art advice (its my job, so she asks me all the time) told her to figure it out on her own. and every time she asks for help, advice, meals. All i say is figure it out yourself or straight up ""no"" i even make sure to put aside the dishes she uses so that it her washing up to do. (I understand I might be a little petty for this

My dad says I'm being too mean to my sister and that I've gotten my point across so should stop but I really don't think I have since she hasn't done anything and just ""promised"" to do more things from now on.

Actions speak louder then words.

I also get my car back next week and don't plan on driving her to work or anywhere when she asks me. Am I the a-hole for this?

AITA for cancelling my son's birthday party because my Mother-In-Law left poop on my toothbrush,"My mother-in-law watches my three kids.  They are age 5, 3 and 7 months.  My mother-in-law usually watches them and drops them off from school. The kids are battling a stomach virus so everyone was home on Monday. 

The little one had a poop explosion so my mother-in-law washed her butt in our bathroom sink.  However, she did not clean up after and there was poop all around the sink, on the toothpaste, on the toothbrushes and the little cups that the kids use when brushing their teeth.  I have pictures if you guys really want to see.

This has happened before but it's the first time we said anything. When my wife called her mom to be more careful because it's absolutely disgusting and gross.  My wife is Hispanic so her tone can definitely be aggressive, especially to a gringo like myself, but her mom seemed to understand the frustration. However, once her sisters (both in their 30s and single for good reason) caught wind that my wife 'belittled' their mother all hell broke loose.  The sisters began defending the mother, calling out how dirty/messy our house is, calling my wife fat and basically just saying how lucky we are to have the MIL in our life and it's no big deal. In fact, were the a-holes for being upset about this. 

I guess the sisters got to my mother-in-law because then MIL came back and started parroting the same talking points about how messy our house is, how ungrateful my wife is and how my MIL cleans our house and cooks for the kids all of the time. My 5 year old son was also at her house this weekend and had an accident where he hershey squirted on the bed cuz he's sick That was also thrown in our face multiple times. They also referred to watching our kids as FAVORS which is weird because they always ask to take them. 

My mother-in-law says she won't come ever again to watch the kids. She no showed today so I had to call out today to watch the baby which is fine.  However, I don't like how the MIL is affecting my job and career with her pettiness as I had some important stuff scheduled today. Keep in mind, we pay her $300 (cash) a week to watch the kids.  Now I'm going to pay about $150 more per month for someone to watch the kids which is no big deal really.

However, my son's birthday is tomorrow. They had a big ol party planned at my mother-in-laws for Saturday. However, I have told everyone that we will not be attending the party and we have barred her family from seeing, giving gifts or even speaking to the kids for the time being.

AITA for telling off my coworker for calling me “Big Booty”,"I(15m) have been working at this resort since last summer and my coworker(17f) G has only joined the company recently within the last two months. 

The general workplace culture is light hearted picking on each other, everyone treats each other like friends and it’s in general just chill. That’s what makes me think I could possibly be the A-hole because I could just be being over sensitive/dramatic about it. 

Our work uniforms are just like khakis and a blue button up, and I have a larger backside so it sticks out in the pants and is very obvious. G ever since she started working in the building has called me names like “Big Booty” or “Juicy Booty” in good fun at first. I told her it made me uncomfortable after the 3rd time she had called me those names and she blew it off saying “Well you do have a juicy booty” or something along those lines it was a while ago

She kept doing it and I told her multiple times that like “hey i would prefer if you didn’t do that” just in a kind polite way so that i’m not causing a bunch of unnecessary drama. 

So today I was already in a bad mood and she said my name while talking to another coworker so I asked her what she needed and she said “Oh we were just talking about your big butt” and I told her in a bit of an aggressive way, not threatening like just more than was probably necessary, to “Stop making comments about my body bitch” 

My other coworkers said that she was just complimenting me and that i’m lucky that I have a “big butt” and should stop complaining

So AITA, I feel like i should’ve handled the situation better and want to apologize to her for raising my voice",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I uninvited my Mother's friends from my wedding that she is paying for?,"I (34m) am marrying my fiance (28f) later this year. 
We got engaged 3 years ago a week before COVID lockdown hit. Due to everything that happened back then and other issues, we have been unable to start making definitive plans.

We were expecting to have to pay for 99% of the wedding ourselves.

Earlier this year my mother reached out to us and told us that she wanted to contribute $20k to the wedding and any of that we didn't use would be ours to keep.

Originally my mother told us that we could use the 20k any way we wanted (even if we wanted to have a courthouse wedding and just pocket the money) the only ""strings"" so to speak were that if we had wedding and reception she got to invite 3 of her close friends and their spouses (a total of 6 guests). We thought this was more than fair.

The other part is that anything over the 20k would need to come out of our own pocket.

Things were fine until we started discussing the details.
My fiance meticulously calculated the budget for each part of the wedding (i.e., dress, venue, photographer, dj etc) and my mother had something negative to say about every choice. Eventually she conceded and just signed the checks.

After all was said and done, we would be walking away with about 4k.

Our guest list had about 100 people on it, when we were discussing logistics with the venue we told them we had around 100 people. My mother interjected saying 100-125. We thought she was just overestimating.

Then a week ago my mother sent the ""updated"" guest list, and her 6 invites has ballooned to over 26 additional guests. Inviting that many extra people would tank the wedding budget, especially since my mother has also been pressuring us to get certain upgrades that spike the price per person.


My fiance was in tears at the end of the conversation, she's already had to keep her own toxic mother from inviting extra people and we've cut several of our own guests to stay within the budget. So my mom using up the excess money on her friends and neighbors seemed entitled, especially after she kept encouraging us to go cheap so we had more money left over.

My parents are currently on a trip out of state, but the plan is to meet with them once they return and put my foot down on this. 
The way I see it there are 2 options:
1. She see sticks to her original 6 guests
Or 2: She adds the cost of all these extra people to the total budget.

I know we are not entitled to her money, but it just irks me that she now wants more control than we agreed to and this is quickly becoming more about throwing a party for her friends than about my fiance and I getting married. I would not have accepted the money had I known this would happen, but now things have been bought and deposits made.

Just to clarify we have not sent out any save the dates yet, and do not plan to until this matter with the guest list is resolved. So no one is being ""uninvited"" after the fact.

Would I be the A-Hole if I tell my mom she can't invite whoever she wants just because she's paying?",Not the A-hole
AITA For taking full credit on a project me and my friend were working on? making her have to redo it 2 days before due.," 

**Near the end of February we were assigned to a project, and you could choose whether or not you wanted to partner up with someone. Well I didn't want to partner with anybody but after my teacher was done talking my friend asked to partner with me, now i'm not dumb and knew she just wanted to partner up and have me do basically everything and she does next to nothing. So I said no, but my friend couldn't take no for an answer and after asking a few more times she finally just sat down beside me and I had no choice but to partner with her because she had already grabbed a paper and was trying to write down plans with me for our project. Since this class we were in was art we had to make something out of cardboard and list major structures in our art , and ""we"" decided on a tiny town representing life so we had a hospital,house, graveyard, school, etc... Now I made her promise to actually work on the project since she's never given any help on the ones we've done before and she ""promised"" that she would. so, nearing the end of our project deadline she hadn't built anything while I've spent hours making houses, adding details and making sure our town looked the way it was intended to. I was the one who spent their time drawing out plans and taking measurements so that our town would look nice. and on Thursday the week before the project was due i had a choir concert. I would be spending all day doing so and wouldn't be at school that day and so I told my friend that she needed to build a building in our town or else I would be taking all the credit for the project. She called me a bitch and agreed to do it so I was happy that maybe finally she was doing something, but sadly I had to wait till Monday to see what she did because of a power outage at our school. When I came in on Monday I saw no new build and only a few pieces of cardboard that she claims was ""decor"" and she didn't even glue them on. i was so mad but i couldn't say it to her face because she was absent that day so I texted her that I would be emailing the teacher later and taking full credit for this project and she wasn't happy with that. so i had to now spend the class period making a whole new building because she couldn't. She begged and begged me through text to not get the teacher involved and to not take full credit for the project. but i didn't listen to her because i was so done with her doing this to me. After I emailed the teacher, I told her and she blocked me on our group chat. The next day the teacher pulled her outside to talk and she ended up having to make a whole new project 2 days before it was due and she didn't have the supplies like I did at home. She stopped talking to me and apparently told our friends about how much of bitch I was,and got them to take her side, and they all ended up helping her with her project too. My friends tell me I should apologize to her and that I'm in the wrong for taking full credit for the project. so, am I the a-hole  here?**",Not the A-hole
AITA for wanting to press charges to my classmates?,"2 months ago, my father unexpectedly passed away. This months have been really hard for me and especially when i am at school and i try to focus. Today i recieved a follow request on Instagram from a user called ""deadfather_(my name)"". I immediately show it to my mother and we filled a report to the police who will find the person who did it. I am 100% sure that it is a classmate of mine since the other people who know about my dad's passing are 50 years old friends of my parents who can't even use social media. My mother told me that when the police  finds the person who did it, she is just going to ""scare them off"" using the cops or someone else and then drop the charges so they will  understand that they are powerless and wont try to do something similar again. I disagree. Throughout my childhood i have been bullied so many times and have changed 4 school because of it. Its about time someone pays for what they have done and i will not feel guilty if they have to pay a fine or go on a juvenile detention center. My mother was shocked and told me it is not fair because they are underage and immature. Am I the a-hole for standing by my opinion even though it's harsh ?


EDIT: The report we filled was not only about my harassment but about harassing a decreased person. Also I am not in the US and the police officers told us that if we take this on court the person who did it will face great consequences. Thats why  I am feeling such guilt.",Not the A-hole
AITA for wanting my brother to stop inviting his friends in our room,"About a year ago, my grandma came to live with us due to her medical condition, and my parents decided to give her my bedroom. As a result, my brother (20M) and I (17F) had to share his room, which we both were not too happy about, but we understood the reasons behind the decision.

During the months that I have been sharing a room with my brother, I have had to put up with a lot ie. him playing loud music through speakers in the room, even at night, which caused me to have a meltdown because I just couldn't sleep...Nowadays, he settles for watching YouTube videos loudly while I'm trying to sleep,but I guess it's better than the speakers.

His side of the room is always messy, I normally wouldn't care but he tends to leave his things on my bed, forcing me to constantly move them. I used to think the worse of it all was when he left his sweaty clothes on the floor, which stunk up the whole room, but recently, he unlocked a new one that can't look past.

This past month, my brother has been coming back from the gym with his friends, and he has taken to invite them in our room. I'm not talking about one or two friends. No, it's 6, 7 and sometimes 8. The number seems to be growing more and more each week.

They're his gym buddies so they come in sweaty, smelly, and very very loud. So loud. They seat on my bed, eat in it and they touch my things. I feel so crowded everytime they come, I've started to retreat to my parents' bedroom as a way to keep my sanity in check.

I fear it might become an everyday occurence so I decided to talk to my parents about it a few days ago. Hoping they would see where I'm coming from and talk to my brother. They didn't. When I talked to my parents about it, they got mad at me, said I was being inconsiderate, that my brother had the right to invite whoever he wanted over because it was also his room. My dad even added, that given it was initially my brother's room, he had the right to do wathever he desired in it more than I did. They suggested that I come to their bedroom if I felt uncomfortable or annoyed when the guys were present but they wouldn't ask my brother to stop bringing his friends in and they asked me to stop looking to start an argument with my brother.

Now I'm still thinking about what they told me and I don't believe that I was being inconsiderate; I just wanted peace in a space that should be as much mine as it is his. And I think my dad was being unfair since it wasn't my decision to give up my room in the first place but theirs.

I feel like my parents, especially my dad, have always given my brother a pass for everything, resulting in him growing up spoiled and with no regard for anyone around him. I've tried to call them out on it, but they always accuse me of being the one who is spoiled and dramatic.

Now, I'm conflicted about my initial feelings and I'm starting to question if I was truly the A-hole in this situation.",Not the A-hole
AITA for getting upset and setting boundaries when my sister decide to surprise visit me?,"I(23F) live in a completely different city from my little sister (21F). I also have ADHD which makes it hard for me to do tasks such as keeping a house clean majority of the time. I have had issues keeping my personal spaces clean growing up as I only got diagnosed in recent years and I am only now finding ways to be more organised and clean. I have been cleaning my house slowly for the past week and half slow as it is hard for me to beat my executive dysfunction caused by my disability and also because I have a 13 week old puppy that had been causing messes that I’ve had to stop and clean before cleaning up my own mess. Now to the topic at hand, my sister decided to visit but without notice she had jokingly mentioned to my other sister whom I live with that she was going to surprise me so she could see how much of a mess my house was (basically looking for a reason to judge and insult me). My Mum overheard this and messaged me so I knew she was visiting. Next day comes and some appointments I had got rescheduled so I felt I should notify my little sister about it. She got mad that Mum told me and then lied saying she was going to visit our Nana who lives in the opposite direction instead. I thinking I have the day to myself now goes to my appointments and only cleans small things like moving dirty dishes to the sink and tidying the bathroom. Who shows up not even half an hour later but my little sister. She immediately starts saying how gross dirty and cluttered my house is and then when I get annoyed says she is here to see my puppy who she hasn’t met yet as I only got him a month and a half ago. She then even tries to give advice on how to clean my house like out a show on while cleaning or put a timer on. Both I had tried over the years trying to figure out a way to clean that would work for me and also things that wouldn’t work for someone with ADHD as tvs make me hyper focused on the screen and ignore everything around me and people with my disability tend to have time blindness meaning a timer wouldn’t work as I would either work too slow which would cause more guilt and not get a lot done or a get a lot done and stop cleaning any further thinking my job is done for the day.
I later messaged her asking her in future to notify me of any future visits ahead of time and to not surprise visit me and lie when I ask and also how hurtful her comments were and the fact that she need to surprise me like I’m some sort of criminal that needed to be caught in the act of being a dysfunctional mentally handicapped human being. She got defensive and said she just wasn’t going to visit me in future and saying she could only handle me in small doses because of how annoying to her I am ( all her issues with me stem from my symptoms of my disability).

"AITA for saying ""oh my god"" at my workplace?","A week ago, my co-teachers and I were all talking about different stuff, and while we were kidding around we started affectionately teasing each other and joking about our different religious beliefs. Long story short, one of my coworkers said ""god willing"", another coworker copied him humorously, they started teasing back and forth about copying each other, and my coworker said she could say god willing as much as she wanted cause she's Catholic (she meant this as a joke and we all took it as a joke). So me being me, I said to them, that they didn't have to worry about me saying god willing because I'm Atheist. The three of us had a good chuckle over what I said.

A different co-teacher turns to me and says, ""But you say oh my god"". I didn't have an immediate response to that, I just paused. She wasn't kidding around, she clearly meant it seriously. After a moment I said to her, ""Lot's of people say oh my god.""

She kept pressing it, asking me if it meant anything to me when I say it, and I said it really didn't mean much at all, and was just a phrase to say in the moment. My coworker who's Catholic backed up what I said by saying it was just something to say from time to time and had no specific meaning.

Now one of the older teachers in the room who wasn't even talking to us up to this point, started repeatedly saying to me ""You believe in something"", and after refusing to get into it with her, I left the room. The teacher who'd asked me about saying oh my god, came out into the hallway and said to me ""You shouldn't be saying oh my god if you're Atheist cause that can offend people"". I didn't respond to her, and she was going the opposite way down the hall at that point anyway, so I went back to my classroom and went home to enjoy my weekend.

Come Monday morning, she didn't say a word to me when she entered the classroom. Later on she asked me if she offended me, and I told her she didn't because that's the truth, she didn't. I told her that I don't mind if people ask me questions about myself or my thoughts on things, and I personally feel people can have whatever views they want to have and it has no bearing on me whatsoever. She can be who she is religiously or otherwise and it's fine with me. She claimed to understand but her tone with me all last week was really short. I have asked her more than once if she's all right, but she just says ""Fine"". She'll have very elaborate conversations with other people but won't talk to me at all, and in the past we've been much friendlier. Everyone else is talking to me fine, nothing seems to have changed.

I'm thinking I might be the a-hole here because I never responded to what she said, and I think she is upset about it but either doesn't want to or doesn't know how to say so. This is honestly the first time as a teacher that I've had a discussion about religious affiliation get weird, cause everywhere else I've ever worked nobody has really cared this much about someone else's belief system.",Not the A-hole
AITA For Not Taking Care Of My Older Sibling/Making my Parents Pay Me," Hello so for context I’m 16F and I have three brothers, two younger and one older(not going to say their age).

Both of my parents work, the only day they don’t work is in Sunday, so I have to take care of my siblings because of that. Recently though, my older brother is being sexist and making me cook and clean for him, because I’m a woman who’s only there to cook, clean, and have children. He knows how to cook and has done it before and he hasn’t passed a recent accident with the stove. I started paying my parents for me to take care of an adult that does nothing besides being on a computer all day. I have told some of my friends about this and they said that I’m not the a-hole. Then I talked to his friends and they said that I am the woman and that’s what I’m supposed to do. I honestly don’t know at this point, he used to clean and cook for himself but he stopped doing it when he changed friend groups. I feel like his new friends contribute to his new personality, but I can’t confirm it. He doesn’t have a job, he is just there. I’m also the emergency contact for all of my brothers and I get frequent calls for my brothers about things that they did, but that doesn’t bother me.

AITA for making my neighbor move a car out of my assigned space at 1am?,"So, I live in a building where we have assigned parking spots. They give you a sticker with a number on it (I'm #80) and you park in the spot with that number. Pretty simple. So, I always have guaranteed parking, unless they're doing some sort of maintenance on the lot.

A bit ago they were redoing the surrounding streets and had to have all the people who live in the area and don't have a parking permit for a space move to other areas, which is obviously inconvenient in a congested urban area, but in theory has no effect on me.

I came home late one night at about 1am from a friend's house and there was a car in my spot. Now, the building has a giant sign up to let people know the lot is under contract with a tow company. I was about to call but noticed the car had a note in the window. Something like, ""DON'T HAVE TOWED! CALL XXX-XXX-XXXX!""

I called and a few minutes later one of my neighbors who would also have an assigned spot, came out. He politely explained that there were no spots on the street, so he offered his girlfriend mine. Which means he parked in his space and then was gentlemanly enough to offer something of someone else's to her.

I let him know it is my spot, so he'd have to move. We had a brief argument about the late hour and how hard it would be for her to find a spot on the street. Not seeing how either of them having trouble finding parking on the street was a ***me*** problem I insisted he move, and he went to get the keys and got out of my spot.

I ran into him in the hallway a few days later, at which point he looked at me and said, ""FUCK YOU!"" I don't think we're going to be friends.

Am I the A-hole for asking him to get out of my spot even if it was 1am and all of the surrounding roads were under construction?",Not the A-hole
AITA Who does not want to help pay for her cousin's bridal shower?,"My cousin (35F) is getting married in Nigeria pretty soon. I (38F) came to America to live with her family when I was 6; needless to say, her parents were abusive. My cousin and I were never close and were mean to each other; she would call me ""immigrant"" and taunt me by saying, ""E.T. phone home"" because I had to call my family back in Nigeria. We constantly fought while I was living with her family.

For my wedding and as a guest, she was late for the wedding and left relatively early during the reception. No gifts. No card. Nothing. I did not care, even though my husband commented years later. I do not get happy birthday texts from her, but I get spammed with text messages reminding me that hers is coming soon.

She cannot have the wedding in the US because her fiance does not have the paperwork, so we all have to go to Nigeria for her wedding... and the price is not pocket-friendly. There is a clothing requirement, so the family has to buy the fabric she selected and find a seamstress/tailor to make our clothes for us (Nigerian custom)...also not pocket-friendly. She expected my siblings to figure out how to pay for the fabric even though they do not have the means. My sister ultimately said she would not go if they were forced to buy the fabric because they had more pressing things to spend the money on. I paid for it anyway, even though my sister told me not to. My sister wanted to bring a plus one, but my cousin said they would need to pay to get it (buy the fabric). She wants the family to have the same fabric.

I got a text early this week that she is having a bridal shower at the end of the month, and I was invited, but unfortunately, I cannot go. This morning, I received a text from one of the bridesmaids saying she had permission from my cousin to ask several other people out of those invited to the bridal shower ""how we would be supporting the shower regarding the budget."" I was immediately annoyed.

Am I the a-hole who is ready to send the text that I do not want to be part of the bridal shower planning committee?",Not the A-hole
AITA: For my brother and I distancing from our pregnant sister?,"Recently I hosted a baby shower for my sister F33 and throughout the day of she kept complaining about the smallest things like the music and desert table. Being the first grandchild in the family I F22 wanted to make it special. Saving for about 6 months I was able to provide a nice babyshower, but with her rude comments and facial expressions of disgust and irritation it was hard to feel that she appreciated our family’s collective efforts. Her pregnancy is unique, she has uterine fibroids and when we found out she was pregnant the whole family were pleasantly surprised. With this said she has a delicate pregnancy and we try to avoid getting her emotional due to the fact she may loose the baby. Thoughout the day of the baby shower I sucked up most of her rude comments and even got to the point where i isolated myself in the house-just for my own mental wellbeing. Meanwhile my brother was outside with her and the baby daddy along with his friend. My brother asked the baby daddy to make sure my sister does r take any work calls (because they always call her on her days off) and to enjoy her day. Not too long after she was stuck to her phone and answering calls and my brother said ‘you had one job to have her off her phone’ to then the baby daddy replying ‘just shut the fuck up why are you on your phone and she can’t?) keep in mind never has any of my sisters ex yelled at us or gotten mad this was a different side of her baby daddy we never expected. And of course my sister did not say anything. After that my brother and i kept inside. My sister messaged us after the party to thank us but we didn’t reply. She called my dad the next morning crying about how we didn’t reply back and received a lecture about being extra special to my sister due to her pregnancy. The baby daddy apologized to my brother but he hasn’t replied back, but my sister hasn’t apologized or reached out since then. Are my brother and I the a-hole for distancing ourselves from my pregnant sister?

"AITA For convincing my brother to not give our school bully a job, despite the fact that this bully may need the money to support his family?","I’m sixteen and a high school junior. There is a kid in my year (I’ll refer to him as “Ezra”) who is a notorious bully. He’s known for acting friendly in front of teachers and other authority figures, but showing his true colors whenever adults aren’t watching. Since he hasn’t bothered me or anyone I know personally, I tried to give Ezra the benefit of the doubt, that the stories of him being a bully were just rumors or misunderstandings. But then I got seated near him in US History, and he **constantly** brags to his friend about bullying people. Things like how he purposely destroyed a kid’s vase in ceramics and he hacked into a girl’s Instagram account to get people to make fun of her.

Now is a good time to mention that my brother is a few years older, and he owns a corner store/mini bakery. Since the store is right next to my school, I go straight there after school and my brother drives us both home. On Friday, I had to stay late at school for softball and saw Ezra leaving the store just as I got there. I asked my brother about it on the drive home since the store was supposed to be closed, and he told me that he needs an extra cashier and just interviewed Ezra for the job. I immediately told my brother that that was the same Ezra from school. My brother told me that he would find a different person to be a cashier because I’ve told him before about Ezra and he said he can’t trust someone like that.

I told some friends that I was relieved my brother didn’t hire Ezra. Most of them were also relieved, but two of them came to me privately and said I did the wrong thing. One said I was being biased and unprofessional because Ezra may be a jerk at school but since he wants to work at the school, he could be a good employee and I would have no idea. But I pointed out that there’s no proof Ezra wouldn’t be a jerk at the store too, and only pretend to be honest when my brother’s watching. Plus, it’s better for the store, because people know Ezra’s a bully and it could hurt business if people stop coming to the store to avoid him.

My other friend told me that since Ezra has a single parent and at least two other siblings, it’s possible Ezra needs the money to support his family. I don’t know if Ezra’s family is struggling financially. But if he genuinely needs the money, he has options like walking dogs or doing yard work. Plus, Ezra potentially having an bad home life doesn’t excuse his bullying. But I read a (now deleted) post on here a few hours ago about someone with a similar experience/situation, and all the comments called that user the A-Hole. So now I’m worried that my two friends were right and that I was also the A-Hole in my situation. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for getting mad on my parents because of my newly spayed cat,"TLDR: Dad brought my spayed cat to have follow-up check up (after the 14-day recovery time) for the spay incision site, escaped from zipper type carrier bag that isn't completely closed while going back home. Escaped around outside my neighborhood at least 1km.

I have this pure black spayed cat, very sweet, that I took care of for 14 days for the spay recovery. She used to be a feral cat when I decided to take care of her last year.

It's been hard for me to let go of this event. I knew that the wound is healing just fine but I don't know why vet wants me to go back after 14 days for check up so I had to tell my parents that if they can bring my cat there for the check up since I have this crunch time at work for days. They used one of the cages I have which is the zipper type carrier bag. Few hours later, dad came home with empty cage, casually tells me that my cat escaped from it. At first he blamed the vet for not keeping the cage closed correctly and he said he tried to look for my cat but he can't go into the houses and lots because they might blame him with the stolen chickens or be labeled as a thief. And of course I got very mad since I've been taking care of her since last year. Why is he telling me that could happen to him when all he needs to do is shout my cat's name or ask around the area and obviously NOT jump inside a random area? Because of that, both of my parents felt like ganging up on me as if it is just a small problem and told me I should be ashamed of myself as if I am the one being illogical. He also vaguely tells me where my cat went. How am I supposed to find her with that vague info when he falls asleep for more than 4 hrs in the afternoon (and it'll be night soon) right after the dispute.

Now I don't know what to do. Maybe hope for someone just call me with my number written on her collar, but she used to be a feral cat, it'll be hard to touch her and even I look around it still be hard because I will never know if she is still in the area or ran somewhere far.

Maybe IMTA, I could've just trusted my instinct that she's doing fine, and no need for the follow up check up. Now the only one that brings happiness is gone, I'm on the very edge, all the treatment they have been giving me is definitely enough.

Edit: I contacted the vet, and yes dad brought him there. Vet  also told me that the spay wounds/stitches are healing fine, just like what I expected since she was confined to a room as she was recovering for the ""maximum"" time (14 days) of the healing process. She's obviously doing just fine, checking the site everyday so healthy to be exact.

Edit: Removed some stuffs from my main post that aren't necessary to the conversation. Since the day she got lost, I have placed her litterbox and food bowl in my front porch.

Edit: Oh come on she's not considered to be an ""ill"" pet. How can she be ill and be allowed by VET to have a spay surgery?? To get the facts straight for you, that follow up check up is given to me on the same day of her surgery cuz obv they only need to check the ""incision site"".

If you're, or anyone, wondering why I didn't get the time. Of course I used all that ""14 days"" as an excuse in the work to ""observe closely"" on her even tho I was told by vet to only observe closely for ""48 HRS"". Usually every month I can only get 2.5 days off, but I was allowed to have 14 days off alright? and after that time, they needed me in the work because of crunch time, get it?, so I have no excuse anymore. couple days passed to really maximize the 14-day recovery time, so I asked my dad cuz of course I still trust my dad (cuz he's still my ""dad"") on bringing her to the vet since ""that escape problem"" had never occurred before. And it seems like my dad felt bad, so he tells me that he is still trying to look for her around the area and I do so myself. 

For now, I'll have no more input since both me and my family are sorting this thing out of who is the a-hole and doing the solutions together to find my missing cat.",Not the A-hole
AITA For Doing Nothing on Valentine's Day,"My wife is my lobster. We met 17 years ago and married two years later, we have two incredible and feral teenage daughters.

I'm the romantic in our marriage. Our 10 year anniversary, I surprised her by flying her brides maids back to our town and held a vow renewal in the same place we got married, with the same photographer, officiant, flowers etc.  

In the beginning, I would make flip book stories and wire art for her from stuff at work.  After we earned more I would start sending her away to visit her girlfriends and jewelry etc  I even surprised her with a Christmas trip to visit her best friend in England where she got to see her great grandmother for the first time in 30, years on her 100th birthday weeks before she passed away.

I'm a hopeless romantic.  Raising two daughters and worshipping t.  It's always been important to me to show them how a partner deserves to be treated.  To never expect or settle for less than their worth.  

My wife not so much, she loves me.  I know.  She just doesn't do romance .She's never done anything for Valentine's Day or anniversaries and even forgot my birthday once.  It never got to me. My daughter suggested i take a break from things and just do nothing for Valentine's Day since ""mom always said we don't need to be told when and how to love our partner"" 

So I got her a signed and personalized book from her favourite author and a hand crafted leather bookmark with her initials.  Well, she found out I'd no real plans and kind of blew up a bit.  Told me it was crappy to not do anything.

I still got flowers, the book; bookmark and resos to her favourite restaurant. but for her to be mad is seriously out of right field.

Am I the A-Hole here?

TLDR; Wife is mad I'm not going all out on V-Day even though she doesn't do romance or special days.

Edit* ok to head some things off.  My wife is incredibly attentive and giving.  Just not overtly romantic and is terrible at gift giving.  Doesn't mean she doesn't try.  She's also not ""spoiled"" sorry if I gave that impression, she's always super grateful and I love thinking about how to make her happy and doing little things for her.  That's not spoiling  her, it's consideration to and for her happiness.  

Our 14 year old suggested a quiet night when I was struggling for ideas as the last 3 months have been insanely stressful with work, renos etc and my wife's best friend seconded it so I'm soliciting marital advice from our 14 year old.  

This is also the first time she's asked if I'd made plans and told her no.  First time in 17 years so it probably came across as shocking to her and I'm worried I've possibly given her the wrong impression about not caring or that hers is possibly just an expectation response.

WIBTA for telling my friend I can no longer watch her dog while she’s gone?,"I (19M) have a friend (20F) who I consider someone very close to me. In spite of that, I feel like sometimes she asks too much of me and expects me to go along with whatever it is every time. She has a 1-year-old dog that is very destructive and high-maintenance. Whenever she has to leave him for several hours, she’ll ask me to watch him, which I didn’t mind doing at first. But, as of recently, she would be gone longer than she said she would be. Keep in mind, I don’t have a car, so I would have to wait for her to return to take me home, or Uber, which is expensive in the area. Last time, I had to dogsit while she went to an amusement park the whole day. Let’s just say it wasn’t pleasant; the dog kept making messes and needing constant attention. I was exhausted when I got home that night and I had work and uni the next day. She offered to buy me dinner but I said there was no need.

Yesterday, she asked me to dogsit again later this week. I told her I didn’t know if I would be able to as I was caught up with homework and exams coming up. She said I wouldn’t have to watch the dog for long, just check on him and make sure he eats and uses the bathroom. I asked if any of her three roommates would be home to do it. She said she’s not on good terms with them right now and “feels bad asking.” I haven’t responded yet. I honestly don’t know what to say, I could shortly check on the dog but I feel like as long as I continue doing so I’ll never be able to stand up for myself and I’ll just be expected every time to do it.

AITA for refusing to help my sister?,"My sister is someone I love dearly. I wished for her, I named her, and she's my built-in bff, but she's a difficult person to be around for long periods of time. For the past few years, she's been making mistakes that have affected the family in that, due to the *""Family always comes first. Family is always there.""* mindset that has been etched into our beings, the family has had to press pause on personal plans on **multiple occasions** to help her fix her mistakes. This means we care for her kids (who we will *never* want to let down and she knows it) while she scrambles to fix things. If you have ever had to take care of kids in any way, you know that it isn't easy and takes up a lot of time.

Last year, my sister and her kids faced a tragedy that continues to anger and shock us today. The anniversary of this tragedy is coming up and my sister is making poor choices and mistakes that she has not learned from (or won't?) and we have been by her side through it all. I'm the eldest of 4 in a Mexican-American home, which means I'm automatically the right-hand and am expected to help when family calls regardless of how I feel about the situation. My sister's *many* mistakes? My arms are tired of catching her every time she falls. 

I'm entering a new chapter in my life. One that has been long overdue that will determine my future in my career and in my relationship. I worked hard to get to this point and have faced my own obstacles to get to where I am today. My sister's latest decision comes at the wrong time for all of us. She has chosen to get cosmetic surgery and has asked me to ""be a mother"" to her 2 oldest children for about a month while she recovers and my mom will be taking care of her and her youngest kid. This doesn't seem a big deal. It's only a month, right? But how many ""it's only this time"" will there be? I thought the last time was going to be the last time and this is putting a small strain on my relationship and my plans because a lot can happen in a month. 

So I said no and now I'm told, specifically by my mom who put it in our heads that we should always answer a family call, that I don't love my sister and I'm never there for my family and why can't I just help out this one time? What about the kids? Don't I love the kids? Like I haven't been helping my family and set my plans aside at all since I was, what, 5? 12? 18?

Am I the a-hole for not wanting to help my sister while she's recovering from her surgery because I think it's the wrong time and she should wait for the youngest to be older and able to care for himself Mexican-style?",Not the A-hole
WIBTA for not wanting to send my “stepmother” a Mother’s Day card?,"Firstly, apologies for any spelling errors. English is my first language but I’m on mobile and spelling errors are inevitable sometimes. For context, I’m 27F and my dad’s wife is 61, while Dad is 63. I’m Canadian btw, if that matters.

Anyway, onto the story.

A bit of backstory is needed for this to make a bit of sense. My “stepmother” (we'll call her Dad’s Wife for the rest of the story because she is no mother to me; that’s also why I put the word stepmother in quotation marks) and I do not have a great relationship. We rarely talk, but when we do, it’s like I have to pick and choose what I say so as to not offend her or otherwise set her off. My spine has been well buffed in recent years.

For the past nine years I’ve been living with my sister (40, let’s call her Sis for simplicity’s sake). Sis is awesome, I love her, and she doesn’t put up with Dad’s Wife’s crap. She’s got an adamantium spine and zero tolerance for Dad’s Wife’s bull crap. That’s rubbed off on me in more recent years as I’ve almost stopped putting up with Dad’s Wife’s crap too. I only text her maybe four times a year (her birthday, Mother’s Day, Christmas and to thank her for wishing me a happy birthday).

But recently, Dad’s Wife pushed the wrong button. It didn’t end in a blow up fight or anything but she did try to push me to do something I didn’t want to do (sending a picture of my room, which was admittedly not very clean at the time but I was actively cleaning it, which I told her). I used to do that in college but it’s been ten years since then.

The conversation went something like this (paraphrasing):

Dad’s Wife: Ok let’s test that. 
Dad’s Wife: Send a picture of your room.
Me: No.
[Side note: thank you, Reddit for teaching me that “No” is a complete sentence.]
Dad’s Wife: Why not?
Me: I’m cleaning it right now.
Dad’s Wife: Did you have some encouragement from you know who? (she means Sis, not Voldemort lol)
Dad’s Wife: If you won’t send a pic it must be really bad.
Me: I just don’t want to.
Me: Is that not enough? (I know it sounds bad but I was almost at my limit.)
Dad’s Wife: No.
Dad’s Wife: I know you better than you think.
Dad’s Wife: Saying that you don’t want to and “is that not enough” is rude and defensive. I was just checking in.

On at least one other occasion (namely last year on my dad’s birthday, which I never forget about, by the way), she berated me for not sending a card when I had been told by him directly that he didn’t need a card, or a present or anything.

There are other instances of similar behaviour but apparently she’s gotten help in the past. I have no idea how true that is.

More on the whole card thing: I like to make handmade cards and give them to people. I’ll do it for friends and family or even just for fun. It’s a hobby I’ve done for the past few-ish years.

Now to my actual question: would I be the a-hole if I didn’t send my dad’s wife a Mother’s Day card?",Not the A-hole

I replied "" I was under the impression I went there for the education, not the sports."" This did not make her happy and she told me (in these exact words) "" I paid a lot of money for you to go there so I figured you would care about how they were doing in basketball. But if you don't care then I will root for the other team"" I basically sent her the laugh emoji back which was probably crappy on my part, but seriously what the heck? Maybe I was the a-hole for how I responded to her, but I don't think it's crappy on my part to not care about how my alma mater is doing in sports.

WIBTA for being reclusive against my friend husband,So I'm living with a couple one of whom is my best friend. I've been here for a couple of years. They took me in as I was struggling before and haven't really got out of it. Recently her husband has been treating her like she's trash and gets mad if she's says something to him. He also talks about me behind my back as he is very selfish. He brags about everything he accomplishes and gets mad if someone does something not for him or benefits him.

He also has to know where his wife is 24/7 even going to her job on his days off. It's getting to be ridiculous. It's got to the point where she is now ignoring everything around her if he's there including her dogs because he wants her full attention.

AITA - Feel like an ATM,"AITA - Been watching your podcast and never thought I would be posting. Me, 49 female, does okay. Husband 57, also does. Solidly middle class. I grew up with my mother, 72, and brother 40. We were dirt poor. Mom is now retired, brother incarcerated. I broke away from family, got two masters degrees and started my own business. Married a hard working man who loves and supports me. 

 Mom was beggaring herself to send money, both legally and not, to incarcerated brother. Went to check on her last summer and she didn't even have water service. Fixed everything broken, got services back on, and contacted the warden of my brothers facility. My mother is now banned from sending him any money and they watch him closely. I provide a commissary allowance for him now, and also a supplementary income for my mother. Its a bite out of our budget but it felt ethically like the right choice for Mom's sake.

 Now, Grandma, 94, is declining. She's always been healthy and independent until 10 days ago.  Grandma is in a facility and 14 hours drive from Mom. I am on the other side of the continent, by choice, as Mom was not a good/nice mom and always favored brother. I have offered to fly Mom to Grandma to say goodbyes in person, despite Grandma saying to leave her alone. Mom refused because of the level of physical assistance she requires and she can't afford to be there without my money.

My mother just called me with a plan. Fly to her, pick her up and drive her the 14 hours to Grandma. Provide lodging, food, and gas, I would work remote for the week, and then drive her the 14 hours home, before flying myself back home. The bare minimum cost of this is steep. I can do it if I don't pay my taxes, or if I pull money from a shared account I have with my husband. My husband is against this. I don't want to do it. I already talked to Grandma and we said all the things. We aren't a close family, other than Mom and brother. But Mom is laying on the guilt, and now brother is sending LONG guilt ridden and mildly threatening emails. They both are saying I am being selfish in not providing this when they know I have money set aside for various travels. 

 They are correct. Husband and I keep a mutual travel account and we both put money in monthly. We have been saving for my 50th birthday, in a couple of months, for nearly 2 years now. My mother's answer is I will still be alive and can go another time. Grandma might be dying. My husband has pointed out that my family, while they have helped me some during the years I was a single mom, going to school and working, before that, they were very abusive and treat me like an ATM. 

Bottom line is I don't want to do it. I do want my mother to like me, and honestly, I don't want her to hurt. I do want to go celebrate my 50th with my husband, and enjoy life. Am I the a-hole for declining this demand from my mother and my brother?",Not the A-hole
AITA for ruining my wife and MIL's (and family's) relationship because MIL was being overly flirty towards me?,"**Update #1 :** Woke up to a text this morning from FIL wanting to grab lunch today. Just me and him. I’m going probably against my better judgment.

**Update #2 :** So sorry for the super late post. A LOT has happened in the past 2 months, and I have been caught up in the whirlwind of what all's been going on. The lunch with my FIL went differently than I was expecting. Essentially he told me MIL has had symptoms of Alzheimer's/Dementia for a couple of years and they hadn't told anyone in the family (and apparently that can cause ""deviant sexual behavior."" He also suspects that she is manic depressive and has been since my wife was born. He apologized for her behavior, and said that they're trying to hold it all together but since he was diagnosed, it's been hard managing the two of those things together and they don't know how to. He asked me to not tell my wife any of this (which I did). He essentially asked me to take one for the team, and I refused. I told him that I understand how difficult this must be for him, but I absolutely cannot lie and take blame for something this reprehensible. He said that he understood and wouldn't expect any less. He told me that he'd misjudged me when my wife and I first started dating (they didn't speak with she or I for a year a half) and apologized for his behavior. He said that in all his life he's never had to confront his problem with racism and that he was working on himself. I accepted his apology and we shook hands and parted ways. Since then, he's been in the hospital twice for week+ long stints (he's currently in the hospital now). We think the cancer has metastasized to his lungs as his oxygen had dropped into the mid-70s this hospital visit. I know that he'd planned on telling the family the truth, but I don't know if he'd gotten around to it because of health issues. All in all, we're hoping for a recovery from this horrible disease. If there's anything anyone needed an update about that I've missed, please reach out. Like I said, it's been a long two months and I've just now gotten around to be online. Thank you all for your patience and understanding.

Sorry for how long this post is!!

So this story starts a little over a year ago when my FIL (70) was diagnosed with cancer. By the time they found it, it had metastasized into neighboring organs and eventually into his spine. During the time when it was first discovered, MIL(58) was under extreme mental duress and would show up at our house, sometimes in the middle of the night crying. My wife (30) at the time was very pregnant and so, with her permission, I (29) would console MIL (hug, assure everything was going to be fine, etc).

We went on a vacation as an entire family, and what we thought was going to be a kind of quiet experience was more of a celebratory one. The treatment was working, the cancer had stopped progressing, and he was in better shape than he should have been.

On this vacation, however, my wife and I had a little extra time one morning and so we lounged out on the balcony of the suite we all had stayed in. To be perfectly frank, I had morning wood and was wearing tight shorts, so you can get the picture. MIL came out onto the balcony as we were stirring and I caught her staring at my crotch. We made eye contact and she looked away, and I greeted her quickly to make it not awkward. The moment passed and everything seemed okay.

Except ever since then, she makes a point of lingering in hugs and brushing her breasts against me when she asks to hold our child (which is every time I'm in the room with them). So, I tried to make a point of not being in the room with her when I'm with my child or coming up with an excuse to not pass them off.

So it all came to a head this past Thanksgiving when we met at their house. There was a moment when I was walking towards the kitchen and she came down the hallway towards me. The hallway is tight at their house and slowly moved past me with her rear poked out into my crotch. That was the last straw. I'd debated up until that point on telling my wife because everything until then felt as though it could be hearsay and MIL would just say it was all in my head. So the following week I sat my wife down and told her everything that'd happened from until Thanksgiving and she was furious. She agreed with me, though, that it could all just be a misunderstanding and wanted to see how MIL interacted with me in the next couple of weeks to see for herself if anything was off.

She watched and I could see in her eyes how much she was stewing inside when we brought our child over to their house and her mom immediately went to take them out of my arms and pressed herself against me in the process. I made eye contact with my wife and she blew up.

Long story short, the family is pissed at *me* for ""starting"" it all and are calling me the a-hole because the family had finally gotten into a place of being at peace and FIL was doing better etc etc. I didn't think of it really in those terms, just how uncomfortable I felt with the situation and maybe I am. But I thought I'd post here and see what you all thought.

"AITA for putting money in a ""private"" account?","I (40 f) have been married to my husband (44 m) for 5 years. We have a 1 year old together. I make low 6 figures annually. He makes under 30k, working part-time nights and watches our child during the day 4 days a week. Grandparents watch our child the other day a week. Bi-weekly I have 20% of my check going to a retirement savings account, 15% in a standard 401k and 5% in a Roth IRA. I've maxed out what I can for my employer contribution, but I could lower the % and still have it maxed. My concern is I'm 40 and only have 1 year of my pay in the accounts. I pay for all of our health insurance, medical, dental, and vision, plus some additional life insurance and pet insurance. I make the maximum HSA contribution I can for a family of 3 at about $250/check (bi-weekly). The HSA has paid for every medical expense we have had, except IVF. This is all pre-tax money. Taxes take about 1/3 of my pay. $300 after taxes goes into my personal checking. I use this for some bills I had before we got together, like my Micrsoft subscription, and also to buy coffee for myself (no, I'm not buying $300 of coffee a month, there are bills being paid here too). The remainder of my check goes into our joint checking. The remainder is 2.5x the amount of our mortgage and we pay for other joint expenses from this account. All of his money goes in this account, and mostly pays for groceries. We do generally have more than $5k in the account just to be safe if something happens. 

He is upset that I have a 401k, Roth IRA, and separate checking account from him. He thinks I'm hiding money away. I have changed contribution levels to be lower, and also adjusted bills so more are coming out of joint checking and more of my pay goes into joint checking.

AITA for wanting to report a house in my neighborhood for their driveway and grey water?,"I (19 y/o female) live at home with my family while going to college. I don't have a license or a car yet since both are in the process, so I take the bus and walk to school and work. When walking to my bus stop, I have to walk by this house that has an almost complete dirt driveway that is constantly muddy and wet, no matter the season. I never understood why or how so I just ignored it for the most part since it was not my property or business. That was until a really bad ice storm hit my area and I almost slipped and fell on my way to my bus stop. I was even more outraged when days later, I was walking by and say what looked like a PCP pipe coming from their basement with what I can only assume was grey water from their washing machine. Although I could be wrong, this would explain why for the past few summers when the water pooled up in their driveway, it grew algea, turned completely green, and completely REAKED of something foul! Normally I wouldn't care but whenever it rains, the water overflows from their dirt driveway and fills the sidewalk aswell, which is a problem not only during the warm months as it freezes over during the winter. I don't want to be the a-hole for not minding my business and letting the landlord fix but what do you guys think?? For a bit of context, I live in michgan and am not too clear on grey water laws and I'm 95% sure they only rent this house and couldn't care less.",Not the A-hole
AITA for standing up for my fiance?,"I’m not English, so I apologize in advance for the mistakes that I make in the post.

I’m 24f and my boyfriend (Mark, 26m) of two years proposed to me this February. I was so happy because I come from a very traditional family so I’m quite a family-oriented person and I’ve always wanted to create a family of my own. But we had a rough start with Mark, he was married before me (no kids), it was an issue for me in the beginning of our relationship, because I felt that a person can marry just once (that was a bit toxic of me), so we argued constantly and then broke up for some time. The separation was pretty dirty, we told each other lots of nasty things to hurt the feelings.  He started talking to other girls, I started seeing some guys too, but we couldn’t be without each other, so we started dating again. After breakup we began appreciating our relationship more, now we talk over our complains instead of yelling aggressively, we’ve become a strong family with a healthy relationship. 

The problem is that I have two close friends, Gina (24f) and Julie (24f), and after breakup with Mark I told them about every issue in our relationship. Every quarrel, every complaint that I had for my ex (at that time), all the details of our breakup – everything was discussed with them, so they pretty much hated Mark, because I did.  But when I told them that he wants to marry me, they were shocked (which I absolutely understand), I assured them that all was fine and I’m happy. Julie said something like “If you’re happy, I’m happy too. It’s the most important thing. Only you know everything about your relationship so I don’t have the right to judge or make assumptions”. But Gina was pissed, she didn’t like it at all and said “It’s your life. Ruin it if you want to”. 

I was upset, but completely understood her feelings, if someone hurt my friend, I would hate them too. Time passed and we continued meeting up with the girls from time to time, but Gina couldn’t stop making comments about Mark. There were phrases like: “He’s so ugly, I hope your kids don’t look like him at all” or “You should think of non-allergic menu for your wedding. I’m allergic to your boyfriend” or “He’s so stupid, you’re much smarter than him” or ""I don't want to marry and have children, it's so stupid"". It was really unpleasant for me, because he is my family, so I stood up for him. I told her that I don’t like them calling him names or insulting him in any other way, so they should stop, because it was my husband, my choice. She said “We’ll call him names in our private chat then, right, Julie?”. So I just left, I felt so bitter, because I supported Gina when her boyfriend cheated on her, and she forgave him and accepted him back. Am I the A-hole for reacting like this or is Gina right?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not showing up to my friends birthday party after being invited?,"My friend (Elli) was threw her 18th birthday party 2 weeks ago. She told us about the party through a message in a group chat a week prior to the party. I was going through a depressive episode at that time and I didn’t open any of the group messages. My friends knew this so they constantly came over in person to talk to me. 

Fast forward to the day of the party and my phone was blowing up. I was at work so I had to wait until my break to check my phone. One of my friends (Abby) claimed I was a horrible person because I ignored their calls/texts telling me that the party was today. I told her I had no idea that Elli was throwing a party today and I had texted her happy birthday before I went to work.

Abby and Elli are both mad at me because I didn’t come. They are both saying I’m the A-hole because I wouldn’t leave work to come to her party. Some of my other friends are taking my side because they knew I was not looking at the group messages. Am I the asshole?

Edit: Whenever my friends would come and see me they never said a word about Elli’s party, so I assumed she was going to go on a mini vacation with her parents because that was what she’s always done for her birthday.",Not the A-hole
AITA for being awkward around my guy best friend after he confessed to me?,"I (18F) and my guy friend (18M) have been friends since we were 6 y/o. Two years ago he confessed that he likes me and I told him that I don't see him that way. I also moved away to another country when I was 10 y/o so I don't know him very well as more of an adult. He didn't take things very well, he told me he wanted space because he couldn't just be friends and he was also mad that I wasn't going back to visit anytime soon. 

We didn't speak for 2 years after that and then I came back to visit. He came to meet me together with another guy friend of mine. I ended up forgetting him and talking to the other guy, leaving him out unintentionally. I tried to talk to him about life and school to start a conversation, but he gave me the cold shoulder.

Another time he came back when all of our friends were going out and I followed him to his room. He showed me gifts he was supposed to give me for Valentine's day. One being a watch that I wanted a long time ago but was kinda expensive. I ended up not taking it cause I didn't know if he still wanted me to. We sat down and talked, then it got quiet and he suddenly tried to kiss me, but his mom walked in. 

After leaving the country, 3 month later he texted me and apologized for being a jerk and acting the way he did. He also said that he was sorry that we didn't spend much time together. I told him it was okay but I was sad we didn't get to spend much time together cause he kinda messed it up. During that conversation, I wanted to also apologize for at least not taking the initiative to reach out to him during those 2 years, but I didn't want to ruin that current nice conversation that we were having. Now I'm questioning if I should have apologized for that and if I'm the A-hole for not apologizing or if it's just him who needed to.",Not the A-hole
AITA for asking my boyfriend for help around the house while I’m pregnant??,"I (29F) am 8 months pregnant with my first child after having two miscarriages back in 2020. I work full time and typically have one day off a week for appointments and things I haven’t been able to do while working. My boyfriend (27) also works full time but usually gets 2-3 days off a week. Now that would be helpful but when he doesn’t have to work (and even days he gets home from work) all he does is play on his Xbox. From 5-6am until 10-11pm and only getting up to make food or go to the bathroom. Now I’m not that kind of girlfriend where I would want him to give up his Xbox forever but I’ve asked him to moderate his gaming time and to not leave me alone in the back room all day and to try to build a relationship with his child before he’s here (voice recognition) Days I leave for work and he’s home I’ll ask him to do 1-2 simple things around the house for me (dishes, vacuum, start a load of laundry, or just pick up his mess from the night before) and he tells me he’ll do it and everything but by the time I get home from work the house looks worse than when I left it. I can tell all he’s done is play his games all day because there is more of a mess around wherever he’s been sitting. When I ask why he didn’t do anything I asked he gets mad and starts yelling at me that he doesn’t want to spend his days off doing chores and cleaning. I let him get away with it but now that I’m 8 months pregnant it’s getting hard for me to do certain things and those are the things I ask him to do. For the last month and a half I’ve had to change and scoop our cat’s litter box because he just can’t seem to find the time to do it. I’m getting so frustrated. Even when he does help out he gets mad about everything. If he’s doing dishes and he has to scrub a dish a little longer than usual he get so mad he’ll start throwing the dish. He’ll slam doors and just yells about everything. I try to fit in as much cleaning as I can on my one day off just so I don’t have to ask him for help but it’s a lot to keep up with it was easier before I was pregnant but now I just get so tired so easily that I’m falling behind on housework. I get not wanting to spend your days off cleaning but I don’t either and he has the nerve to tell me I don’t do anything around the house. I’m hurt and kind of heart broken but not sure if I’m the A-hole or not for asking him to help out after letting him get away with not helping before the pregnancy.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not inviting my cousin to my wedding?,"Hello Reddit, I’m 23F and I’m getting married this May to my long-term boyfriend 27M.  We’ve been waiting to get married for about a year since we’ve been saving up our finances to move out and now is the perfect time to start the process of getting married. I’m very excited! 

We have told our intermediate families so far and they are all ecstatic for us and support us 100%. However, there is just one problem. I have a cousin 25F who has bullied me my entire life. I do not want said cousin at my wedding. Growing up, she made my life a living hell. She never missed a chance to make fun of me and she used to physically bully me as well. I remember times she would make up scenarios and would tell me people from school called me ugly, fat and a slut just to make me upset and feel insecure about myself. At one point she even admitted she was jealous of me. 

These days I feel like we’re only civil because our moms are very close. Her mom is my mom’s sister. This peace helps our family “stick together” and there has been no major incidents since then. To this day, she still makes snide remarks or backhanded comments to me. 

I’ve come to realize that putting up with that toxic behavior is unhealthy and this is my wedding day. I deserve to feel happy. I decided that I don’t want to invite her to something that is supposed to be one of the happiest days of my life. She doesn’t deserve to be apart of my happiness. I told my mother this and she was upset. 

She thinks if I invite my aunts family and exclude said cousin, my aunt will be very upset and it will cause a whole family fight. My mom also said it will trigger her anxieties and make her feel uncomfortable at my own wedding. I told her if my aunt doesn’t want to come because my cousin is uninvited, I would have no hard feelings towards her and I completely understand. This wasn’t enough for my mom and she was still upset at my response. She doesn’t think it’s worth not inviting my cousin for “one day” and that it would cause a “lifetime of conflict”. My fiancé thinks I’m in the right and he personally doesn’t want her at the wedding because of how she treated me in the past. He said it’s our day and we can choose who we want at our wedding. I still feel like I might be the a-hole for potentially causing drama just because of not wanting to invite my cousin.

AITA for taking away students chairs?,"I am a 19 year old male student who is a art teachers aide in a school that I attend. This school has students from pre-k to high school. Being a teachers aide mostly involves me helping the teacher with projects and making sure little kids behave. Most of my time spent is just walking in circles making sure the kids sit properly. This is because this year my school replaces all of our chairs with new ones that are honestly quite terrible. The back support on these chairs are super low and the legs on each side are all making it look like a U. If you lean back in these chairs even a little bit they have a tendency to fall backwards. I have almost fallen myself in these chairs on multiple occasions.

Because of this I was told by the teacher how to go about disciplining kids that don't listen and lean back in their chairs. I will just walk up and tell the students to please sit properly. But it turns out about a month ago a little girl complained to her dad and big brother which also happened to me my friend and work partner. His dad told my friend to confront me at work which he did very aggressively explaining to me that if I step on the chair again that it will be his dad talking to me next time and not him and his words he told me to ""just give her special treatment"". I tried to explain that most of what I do is teachers instructions on what to do minus stepping on the chairs. to clarify i would step on the connected part of the chair when they were leaning back to push it down to the floor. I understand that stepping on the chairs was possibly taking it a bit far and agreed to never do it again. I have since stopped stepping on the chairs to avoid future confrontation but I still take away their chairs. This was over four weeks ago and I was once again confronted by my friend about disciplining his little sister more aggressive than the last time while receiving indirect threats of violence from him.

He told me I am not a disciplinary and I can't be disciplining kids. I tried explaining to him once again that I have stopped stepping on chairs and I have just been following the teachers instructions. I have brought this matter up to my teacher including telling her about stepping on the chairs. She directed me to just tell them to talk with her if they have a issue which is exactly what I did. Since then I have blocked my friend on all social media platforms and phone numbers. I have also asked the teacher present at the time for a written letter explaining I did not physically attack my friends little sister making her fall. This is the story that I heard he told my boss who later asked for the full story since he knows how his family is.

AITA for not wanting to babysit my sister and her friends this weekend?,"&#x200B;

(I am using a throwaway because I don't want this in my main account)

Hi everyone,  I'm an 19-year-old guy who has a 11-year-old sister. My parents both work full-time and they usually ask me to babysit my sister on weekends. I've been doing this for a while now and I don't mind it most of the time, but this weekend I have plans with my girlfriend since she will be away with her family on valentine's day.

Here's the problem: my parents are asking me to cancel my plans and stay home to babysit my sister who is also having some friends over, yes I knew I was going to have this problem when I told my girlfriend that we can do stuff for the next couple days, but my parents usually don't mind me being busy and will usually ask one of our neighbors to care care of her, so none of this would be an issue if if I hadn't learned last night that her friends were also coming over, so I need to make them food and whatever else, we couldn't possibly ask anyone else to do that (and yes the girls have come over before so I know how to deal with them, their parents trust me as well.)

I understand that my parents are working the weekend, but I  need a break from my responsibilities to enjoy my time. I've been working harddd to graduate and get into college lately and I just need a weekend off. I've been looking forward to this for a while now and I don't want to give it up.  I've tried to talk to my parents about this and I've told them that I don't want to give up my plans but they don't care. They say that I'm the only one who can take care of my sister and that I need to be more responsible since I don't pay rent, don't have a job, had to redo my senior year of hs (that's a whole other story) and have been living for free.

I understand their point of view, but I feel like I've been taking care of my sister a lot lately and I just need a break.  I've also suggested that they ask one of their friends or family members to help out this weekend, but they don't want to impose on anyone else. I don't know what to do. I feel guilty for not wanting to babysit my sister, but I also feel like I deserve some time to myself. Am I the a-hole in this situation?",Not the A-hole
AITA for Throwing Away the Free Items my Neighbor Left on the Street?,"My neighbor, Laura (45, F), moved next door to my family and me (39, F) 4 years ago. We were friends at first.
  
Looking at homes, I am on the left, she's on the right. In the middle, nxt to the street curb is a drainage grate. My driveway is nxt to the grate and I park right by it. Her driveway is up a bit so, she doesn't see the drainage grate when she goes to her car.
 
When her child(5, M) outgrew toys she would leave them on the drainage grate in between our houses with a ""free"" sign. As do many people. It wasn't an issue at first. 

Laura and I decided to put up a community food pantry on the grate between our houses. People drove up and grabbed non-perishable food items. One morning, I found broken toys left at the pantry.  Our rule was donations of food only. It was a sit-on car with a missing wheel and a piano with some missing keys. There were sharp edges that could have hurt a child so I threw the toys in my trash can. 

Frustrated, I called Laura and said, ""Somebody left a bunch of junk at the food pantry."" ""Junk?!"" She exclaimed, "" Those toys were not junk they were perfectly good and maybe somebody wanted them."" I told her I didn't know she had put them there and that we should just stick to food so nobody else puts toys. I apologized for calling the toys she was getting rid of ""junk"". 

About a week later, Laura was adamant we take down the pantry. It was giving her panic attacks, people coming by our houses at all hours. We removed it the next day.
 
Things she left on the street for free were there for weeks and weeks. Nobody wanted these toys. She would add more periodically. I would gently ask her about it in conversation. 

I did a dump run at my house. I asked if she wanted me to bring the toys to the dump, they had been there 6 weeks. She got angry, said I needed to stop bugging her about the toys. She said ""Once I bring the items to the street. They are out of my mind and they need to be out of yours too."" And ""what she does on her property is her business."" 
 
Later, I was in my driveway. A lady drove by, looking at one of the toys. A play kitchen. She asked me ""Are you getting rid of this?"" I told her ""It's not mine. It's the neighbors, and yes its free."" The lady looked and said ""oh it seems to be broken"" she left the toy. I loaded the kitchen toy up that night along with the other 4 items and dumped them. 

She texted me screenshots of me on her ring camera. She threatened that if I touch her stuff again she will call the cops. I couldn't believe she would threaten me like that. I told her I felt sorry for her attachment to things and advised she get help to figure out why she can't just throw things away. We have not talked since that day. 

Some of my friends said I am the A-hole because the stuff was not on my property. I don't think I was because it made the street trashy and the toys were not even decent quality. A couple of days, sure, but more than a month is excessive. Am I the A-Hole?",Not the A-hole
AITA FOR CONFRONTING MY BFF FOR BEING ENTITLED?,"I(22) have two best friends, Alli(21) and Jessy(22), but we're just going to talk about Alli. I and Jessy have already been best friends since 5th grade when we met Alli. Jessy asked her if she wanted to hang out with us, which she agreed to, and she's been hanging out with us ever since. But then Jessy and I noticed something about Alli when the three of us hung out to catch up with each other, telling stories, and every single time Alli would just butt in and just talk about herself and tell the same story again and again, each time with different versions. She also likes self-pity and playing victim, and there was one time we invited Alli to go to the mall, and she said she was sick, but we saw her in the mall that day.

&#x200B;

And when we went out to eat, as usual, Alli said she had no money, and because I got a part-time job, I offered to pay for her food, so I asked, ""What do you want to eat?"" and she answered, ""I'm fine with whatever; I mean, you're going to pay for it; just choose anything."" I said, ""Are you sure?"" ""What if you don't like it?"" She said that it was fine, so I ordered the food. When the food came to our table, she just looked sad and said she couldn't eat the food I chose and paid for because it wasn't the food she wanted. I was confused because I clearly asked her what she wanted upon ordering, and now she's acting like I didn't.

&#x200B;

I always knew she was entitled, but something happened that got me to end my friendship with her. It was after exam week, and our parents arranged a weekend trip for us. We (Jessy and I) invited Alli, but she said she wouldn't come because she and her other friends would throw a party the same day of the trip. Saturday came, and Alli showed up unannounced with her bag and all. I asked why she was there, but she didn't answer; instead, she was checking out how great and pretty the resort was, then proceeded to ask where her room was. I told her that my mom booked a room with two beds that Jessy and I share, and everything our parents paid for is just for two people since she wouldn't come, but she could just get one. Alli got mad and said, ""I wasted my time here!"" I came here, and what? pay for my room?"" and she goes on about how her other friends won't do this to her, etc. That's when I realized that she expects us to pay for everything like we are her credit card. It hurts me that she only hung out with us for money, I confronted her, telling her to get lost and we don't need such a person in our lives. Security escorted her out because she was throwing things around, including displays in the lobby. Jessy and I are still best friends, and we never talked about Alli after that.

&#x200B;

I may be the a-hole cuz when my parents heard bout what happened They told me that I should've just confronted her in private instead of causing a scene and I should just forgive her for the sake of our ""friendship"". So I need your opinion, AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my father to F Off," 

This is a long story but I will try to sum it up as much as I can.

On Christmas of 2014, my father told my mom he didn't love her anymore after 38 years of marriage. It was a confusing few months after. My dad left the house a month later and stayed with my brother for a little while before leaving entirely. 

There was a lot of fights and crying and confusion for the next year. My father slowly started withdrawing from my brothers and I. And every time I tried talking to him he'd ignore it. I even sent a 13 page long letter that he claimed never reached him. Finally, after their divorce finalized, he sent an invitation to his wedding to my two oldest brothers and blocked me on facebook in the same week.

It has been 7 years since I talked to him (last time being the day before I turned 21) and he never tried to reach out until now. In October he sent a text that basically said ""I got your number from your brother"" and my Grandmother wanted all of her grandchildren at her birthday this year and I needed to go. There was no mention of the 7 years of silence, nothing to indicate that he even acknowledged the amount of time that had passed. I thought about just ignoring it but after thinking about it I sent him a text that said breaking his silence this way was a shitty thing to do and then said he could F\* off.

When I didn't get an answer for a while, I figured he wouldn't care. But then I received a message from his new wife calling me an a\*\*hole and waxing poetic about how amazing my father is and if I had wanted to talk to him I could have contacted him at any time. Very soon after, he sent a similar message with a screenshot of my text attached and telling me I was being a child.

I blocked the woman's number without a response and then explained in small words that telling someone to come to a birthday party is not the best way to end a 7 year silence as well as a reminder that I had been the last person to contact him before he decided I wasn't worth the effort. I also told him to tell his wife that she should not contact me again (though the sarcasm might have been strong as I reminded him he taught me not to talk to strangers). He sent a very long message that basically called me an a-hole and immature and told me if I was going to therapy I would know that I should be a better person or something. He chastised me for not wanting to talk to his wife and then reminded me how he didn't want negativity in his life and I shouldn't be so rude and reactive. I sent him one last voice message where I told him everything I'd been wishing I could have said 7 years ago but despite cutting him off once and for all but I can't get the words out of my head.

I'm not sure if this even makes sense but if I wrote everything that happened I'd be here for a year. Am I the a\*\*hole for telling my dad to f\*\*\* off instead of answering his first text after 7 years of silence?",Not the A-hole

Prior to me deciding that I would like to leave university, I had set up a couple of job offers that would help me sustain myself financially so I would have something to go on once I leave.  

My family which consists of my parents and 2 older siblings consider this to be a very bad decision as they think that getting a university degree is utterly important to move forward in life. Ever since I have told them about my decision, they have made their point of view extremely clear about and my parents have even told me that they would cut me off if I go against their wishes. However, I told them that I could get an online degree while I worked full time for a company. That too is unacceptable to them.

AITA for wanting more safety in an around the house?,"Little background here for this story.

The fence needs to be done to prevent anyone to fall down approximately 1 meter.

While we don't have a big budget, she still buys all kinds of stuff while she knows i want to get things done and not putting some money aside won't work in the way she is spending our money.

WIBTA if I tell my MIL she can’t watch my baby this weekend?,"Hello Reddit, me again 

I (24f) am due to go out this weekend with my partner (28m)- it’s my birthday weekend and we’re at a wedding as well so the initial plan was to have my 5 month old stay with my in laws for the weekend. 

They always love having him and they genuinely get so upset when they can’t see him. 

My dad can’t help out as much because he’s got two young children under 5 of his own so he sometimes struggles but has offered a couple of times. 

Anyway skip to today and norovirus is going about my in-laws house. It started with my fiancés youngest brother on Thursday, then his second brother last night and now his mother doesn’t feel quite right and he recons it’s only a matter of time before his parents both get it. 

They’re saying they should all be okay to take him this Friday but I’m a little apprehensive and would prefer if he stayed at my dads as he has offered. This is because my son is still on the back end of bronchitis (he was in hospital for it only 2 weeks ago) and the last thing I want to do is even risk him getting norovirus whilst he’s still recovering. I’m being told that I’m too clingy and acting as a helicopter parent because they said they’ll all be okay by Friday but I’m more worried about germs still lingering. 

They’re saying they’d be really upset if they don’t have him, that they’ve been really looking forward for it and they had plans and I feel really guilty and I’m not sure if I would be the a-hole if I refuse to let them look after my son.

**Edit to add** I’ve had a few people tell me I shouldn’t even be going out 

I firstly want to say if I felt my son was too unwell to go anywhere then of course I’d stay home with him. But I am his mother so I make that call about whether or not he’s too unwell. He’s just got a cough still and has recovered from the worst, but the doctors told us the cough can linger for a couple of months. 

I am absolutely going out because it’s my 25th birthday as well as my best friends wedding and I’ve not really done anything I’ve wanted to do for months. I’ve asked for your opinion on refusing my MIL, I haven’t asked for unwarranted opinions on whether I should be going out at all OR if my dad is responsible. My dad is very responsible and I would never impose on him unless he has offered. I should add he’s desperate to spend time with his grandson as he has never ever spent the day with him alone. He’s raised 2 kids into adulthood and 2 children currently, he’s the extremely responsible.

**Edit 2** 

I know not to leave my son with people who are sick, I was more worried about lingering germs. I trust my in laws would be fine by Friday but I know norovirus can live on surfaces for up to 2 weeks. We’ll be seeing them at Christmas anyway so there’s no harm in waiting the extra 2.5 weeks. I just wanted to know if I would be the a-hole as I was guilted and told I’m a helicopter parent and essentially paranoid about small germs. 

To add once more, **my son’s doctor gave him the all clear to resume normal activities** so unless you’re his doctor and have seen him in person, then giving me advice on his health is going to fall on deaf ears… or blind eyes in reddits case 

**he has a lingering cough, that is it. If I felt he wasn’t well enough to go to my dads then I’d keep him at home with his dad who is in the picture because if you’re going to reprimand me for having a day off, why does his dad get off scott free?**

Telling me I’m a terrible mother because my son is going to be in the loving and wonderful hands of my father and step mother is bizarre.",Not the A-hole
AITA for taking the last Bluey plushie for myself?,"For some background I (28 F) have childhood trauma which caused me to grow up quickly and not experience childhood. Recently for the past few weeks I have gotten into the show Bluey, my comfort show. 

This morning I had went to a local store and there was a giant Bluey plushie, it was the last one in the box. I went up to it and grabbed it, putting it in my cart. I then heard a kid start crying near me and I turned around to see the kid like right next to me pointing at the Bluey plushie in my cart. The woman came up to me with her crying kid and asked if she could maybe have the last plushie because her son has been wanting one for forever. I told her no because I had also been wanting one for a while now, I began to walk away and when I was out of earsite (or so the woman thought) she began muttering about how I was a b*tch for taking the last one especially because I was a grown adult.  I told my friends about this and they said I am the a-hole for taking the last one from a kid when I'm an adult. So AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my mom and sister to pay our bills if they agree my wife should be able to be a stay at home?,"My (28M) wife (31F) has recently started to express interest in being a SAHW to prep for being a SAHM. We don't have kids and haven't been trying, and before getting married, we talked about kids and work/home arrangement and we agreed that we’d both work prior to and once we had kids, and agreed we'd take turns with the 'stay at home' portion for the first year or two after potential kids were born then both back to work.

Now she wants to do away with that and wants to be a stay-at-home wife until we have kids and then be a stay-at-home mom. I don't want that, I never wanted that, and I made that clear from the start when we got serious. I enjoy my job a lot but my salary can’t sustain a family and I don't want to go back to school and change careers like she wants me to to make it happen. I don't want to take up a second job either knowing I'd still be doing half the housework and childcare (not that that's a bad thing) whereas both my mom and her parents are local she'd have plenty of help during the day and able to get downtime.

We had dinner at my mother's a couple days ago with my sister and her kids. While we were there my wife goes:

""Your son's being mean, he won't let me be a stay-at-home mom.""

First my family took this as she's pregnant and got excited so I had to tell them that wasn't it. She just wants to be a stay at home. It turned into this three-on-one conversation about how I should let her stay home if that's what she really wants and I should be taking care of her and finding a way to make this happen for her. Finally I go:

""Would you two help her with the house whenever she needs it?""

""Of course! That's what family is for! Especially when you start having kids we'll help!""

""Cool. Keep that same energy and help me pay all our bills and every other expense to upkeep our current quality of life if you feel so strongly she should get to stay home.""

They did not like that and told me I was being overdramatic. My mom called me stubborn and told me to find corners to cut to afford everything on my salary and drop things like streaming services, some of my hobbies, go from two cars to one, etc. We left and my wife wasn't too happy on the way home. She says I was out of line for saying that to my mom and sister especially since she thinks I was serious. Was I the a-hole for telling my mom and sister to pay our bills if they wanted me to go along with it?

E: Please stop with the vasectomy messages. They aren't 100% reversible, success rate goes down each year post procedure and I DO want kids someday. I am mindful that a babytrap is always possible.

E2: Holy crap this blew up. Thanks everyone for all of your responses. I do know to be careful of oopsie babies right now so abstinence instead of just condoms for now. For those of you insisting I reconsider- no, look I'm glad the Stay-at-home/one income works for you all and you enjoy it, but it's not for me. I'm well aware 1 income means being financially tight, but its more than that- I don't want the stress of making sure I'm making enough on my own with 2 jobs, and also doing my part in the house and being a parent. I'd much rather get to spend time with my kids when I have them, not be a stranger that falls asleep at dinner and spends a bit of time like my father was. Since this post was more about my mom and sister, (I know all about the issues my wife is presenting atm and my options) I'm going to tell them to lay off. Either they do, or I just drop contact with them but I won't be giving them an ultimatum about it. ",Not the A-hole
AITA for how I handled inappropriate comments that were directed at me and my friend,"Hi, sorry for the format I’m on mobile. This just happened last night and I was wondering was I in the wrong? So I currently attend a 4 year college and me and my friend, we can call her Amy, where walking to go help my other friend (sam) get her piercing out and on the way to her dorm her “friend” she talks to (AH) proceeded to say we looked like “ladies on the corner”. I let that one slide and remained calm and kept walking to Sam’s dorm. After we arrived she invited AH over once he got there everything was fine at first but after a while he kept bringing up inappropriate things like calling us ladies on the corner again, calling us fat, and told Amy she was built like a door and looked funny. A little backstory on Amy she had and still has very bad insecurities issues and has suffered from an eating disorder. After sometime of this and apparently no one else hearing him say this stuff except me and Amy I noticed Amy looked uncomfortable so I told her let’s bounce. Once we got back into our dorm Amy broke down crying cause what he said really brought back very harsh insecurities that she has dealt with all her life. I didn’t really care what he said about me but Amy and I are childhood friends and seeing her cry like that really made me upset. So here’s where I might be the a-hole instead of texting him I called Sam and went off. I told her how disgusting it was that he would say something so degrading but claims he is a Man with Morals and how due to his behavior it can cause Amy to start starving herself again. After that he basically claimed he didn’t know about the disorder and she just kept giving him excuses and he gave me and Amy this lame apology that started with “yo”. So to wrap this up I didn’t respond to him and told Sam if he is around we are not and there is basically a drift in our friendship. So AITA for causing the drift or should I have done something different?
Also the reason I didn’t speak up in her room was because it was quite hours and I didn’t wanna risk her getting fined for yelling so I just walked off.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not wanting to be around my mom?,"I’m going to add some TWs: fat shaming, body shaming. If you are sensitive to such topics, you better skip this post.

Hello everyone! First time posting on Reddit, since I mostly just lurk here and read posts.

I (20F) live with my mother. I’m her only child and my dad is not in the picture. She’s a great mother and I’ve reached a lot in life thanks to her, but the problem is that she can be a bit too harsh and straightforward for my liking.

My mom never talked down about my looks, until a couple of months ago, when we found out that I gained 12 kilos in weight. This pissed her off real bad.

She constantly tells me that I need to lose weight, sometimes calls me a fat cow, makes fun of me and mocks me. She’ll go out of her way to tell me that “these pants make your huge ass look even bigger” or “why aren’t you wearing ___? Too fat for that?”. She will outright tell me that I’m not attractive to men, then the next day she will tell me that I’m pretty. 

This isn’t the complete list of what she does, it would take too long to describe everything. I have to add that everyone in our family is pretty chubby or even overweight, so was my mom. She started working out with a personal trainer and has been doing so for about a year now. I’m extremely proud of her and I see that she’s making progress, but I can’t help but feel that her workouts make her so full of herself. 

Another thing she does is compare me to herself when she was my age. I don’t think I should mention that my self-esteem is lower that ever right now because of all this.

My old clothes don’t fit me and I mostly wear sportswear now, which pisses my mom off even more. She says that I stopped caring about my looks and that this is unacceptable for a young girl like me. But what she can’t seem to understand is that when my self-esteem is so low, I don’t feel like caring about myself at all.

So, naturally, I try to spend as little time with her as possible. Life feels like hell right now, because she’s on a sick leave (nothing serious so she can take care of herself) and hence is constantly at home. I went to my boyfriend’s place and have been staying there for almost a week now. Tonight I’m supposed to go home, but I dread to even think of it.

So, am I the a-hole for not wanting to go home to her?",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I didn't let my brother move in with me?,"I (25f) and my bf (25m) live in a 2 bdrm apartment with our best friend (22m) and it's been going great. We all pitch in and keep everything running smoothly for the most part. However that changed this month. 

My brother (26m) and his gf (18f) were homeless up until the first when I finally caved and let them stay with me until we move back home (30 mins away) in a few months. I do charge them rent, $250 a month for both of them to originally use the living room as we all usually stay in our rooms, but they've been staying in my roommates room and he seems fine with it no big deal. (I'm pretty sure they're having ""sleepovers"" in there) 

So my main issue is when we move back to my hometown rent will be almost twice that if not more and I don't even like my brother (in fact I hate him for a lot of reasons) so I'm not going to cover for him if he's not dependable. And so far in the one month he hasn't been. He doesn't cook for himself or clean if anything is getting done its his his gf doing everything or I have to pick up the slack. He also gets mad at me for not sharing anything I cook even though when I gave him rules for staying one was I'm not sharing unless I say I'm sharing, I don't have the money to feed 5 people every day. 

 To top it all off he always has an attitude with me over the dumbest things. He picks fights and complains about his medical issues constantly (none diagnosised even though he's been to specialists, they say hes a hypochondriac) and to be honest the only reason let them move in because his gf is only 18 and I didn't feel like she deserved to be homeless because of his mistakes. Hes burned every bridge including our parents. Sowould I be the a-hole if I didn't let him move in with us when we move back to town?",Not the A-hole
AITA for repeating myself to a customer?,"So this happened yesterday. For some background I (31F) work at a phone store. I am also Eurocentric in terms of my appearance. My family is mostly from Central America, I look white, I know it. Anyway… a customer comes in and I go to try to help her. She is an older black woman. She wants help putting on a screen protector for her phone that she did not purchase from us. Ok, we do that a lot, however when we do it we usually tell the customers that if for some reason we mess up we cannot replace the item. I explained this to the customer and she began to get defensive with me. This is where I might be the A-hole I did repeat the same statement 2 other times and trying to hold back my irritation because she had accused me of wanting to “mess up on purpose,” so that she would have to purchase one from us. She then says she doesn’t want my help and goes to my co-worker (also a black woman) and my co-worker told her the same thing. After the customer let my co-worker put the screen protector on I asked if the customer said that I was racist and she said that, that’s how she (the customer) felt. I did feel bad if I came off a little strong, but that afternoon I wasn’t in the best headspace and after she had accused me of trying to mess up I was admittedly annoyed. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA or is it my boss?,"Today, my boss eavesdropped on a convo me and my coworker had about our boss.

Context: me and my coworker are managers of a spa. She does general management, and I am in inventory and retail. Our boss appointed us because she wants to be able to step away from the business and focus on other things. Every month, me, my coworker, and boss have a meeting about sales, discounts, skill development, etc. One of the months, my boss asked what we thought she should work on, and we said communication because they are bad and lack A LOT of details. The spa is also open 7 days a week and open pretty late so many of us don't get to spend much time with our loved ones. And if we do want to plan time off, it has to be requested a month in advance. Fast forward, nothing is really changing with her. Even though we are managers, we must run everything thru our boss first.

Yesterday and today, the weather was bad and many of our clients were rescheduling. The other manager wanted to close because the roads were bad and didn't want the closing employee who lives on the other side of town to drive to service a few people and drive home in even worse weather. But our boss said no because she lives on the other side of town too. However, she ended up changing her mind and we closed.

Today, was the same thing except she had the receptionist rescheduling people without telling anyone and employees still showed up just to go back home. My coworker/manager calls me to tell me all the events that going on with work. She just explains to me that she wishes our boss would be more considerate because we also have life outside of work. I respond with I totally agree because I know this is not where I want to be long term and our boss should understand that this is her dream/goal not ours so she shouldn't force us to have the same exact goal as hers. I also told her maybe we can talk about it at our next meeting. Well, our boss heard this over the camera in our spa and pulled up on my coworker and came in hot because she thought we were talking badly about her.

My coworker explained to our boss that everything she heard was everything we wanted to bring up at our next meeting and we just want her to understand that many of the girls there were feeling like our boss was not being understanding of our outside lives. Now, my coworker feels like an a-hole for upsetting our boss.

Therefore,

Are we (the employees) the a-hole for being upset or our boss who we feel is not considerate?

EDIT: 

It's been a rough week at work: One girl just quit because our boss just denied her request to take off Sundays, another gal is on vacay, and I'm out sick.

Now that I've become a manager, I see a lot of turnovers because this job is demanding and idk how to bring it up to our boss that maybe she should consider cutting our opening hours or closing on a Sunday. That way some of us who have families can have some balance. ",Not the A-hole
WIBTA for putting up a 5-6 ft fence,"I just moved back into my house (house fire a year ago) and let my dogs out into the yard. I have neighbors who have a little porch lean to thing in the back of their house that butts up to my yard. They have a makeshift wall that's approximately 4.5 to 5 feet tall that separates our properties. When they come out my dogs run up and jump up at the opening on top and just today, not even 24 hrs of being back, they yelled at my wife and I to handle our dogs. Mind you that the dogs didn't get over the wall just jump and bark. 

The neighbors decided to yell at my wife about the issue and it upset me. They want me to put a wire like fence 3 ft from their hovel to stop my dogs from jumping at the space. I don't want to lose any of my property a d was honestly frustrated over the whole ordeal. 

This is where I'm probably the a-hole, I was digging a post-hole and was going to install a six foot wood fence in front of the space so my dogs won't be able to see them and they won't be bothered by my dogs, however it will obstruct most of the natural light that goes into their space. So, am I the A-hole if I choose to just install the fence and null out the problem?



Edit: 

The issue alone isn't that my dogs bark and are loud, it's about my dogs jumping and peeking a head over and a paw, just to fall back down all while barking.

I should also mention this riles up the neighbors dog as well.

Update:

I installed a little 5ft wire fence 4 feet from the wall they have. After about 3 days it was bent and a hazard to my doggos. So I went to the store with the orange and white, and bought the materials to install the fence. It's up and man they are angry! My dogs still react to the fence, jump a little and bark but that's it, the fence is still standing with no signs of stress. 

However, the neighbor just doesn't like the dogs ""charging"" the fence and basically just wants me to ""man handle"" them and put them away whenever they are out. That's not feasible to me and not fair to my dogs. The neighbors threatened complaints and I gave the go ahead on it so we will see what happens from now on.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not helping my FH build a fence,"me and my fh bought a house a few months ago. i have horses and the place my horses were being kept was having their power&water cut off so we put up a small pen so we could bring them home. we were ready to fence them in a larger pasture and he asked me to help. i said i would and got up at 6am to get out and help him. we had to move some building material out of the way before we could start. 
i helped him move a couple pieces when he stopped and starred at a pile of siding. he said that he wasnt a fan of the siding (the building material was for a chicken coop) and wanted to use the pile of pallet we had as siding instead. 
*i am a major DIYer and i like doing things cheap as possible and with the price of lumber and all the stuff we have to build for our animals i was SO happy to be given a trailer load of free high quality pallets

i guess i pulled a face (my face talks more than i do, i know thats a problem, i am working on it) so he asked if i had a better idea. i said that i felt like using the pallets for siding defeated the purpose of having them for building stuff.

he got mad and started yelling ""F* me then, how long do i have to work my a$$ off for you before you appreciate something, all i get from you is ridicule""
i very calmly told him that he asked my opinion, i gave it and that i was not ridiculing him. that if he wanted me to be a ""yes man"" and just agree with him than he needs to make that clear. 
i picked up the floor section of the building and started to pull it. it was a whole 10x10 floor with frame and floor joists, so not light at all. he picked up the other half and started shoving against it ""helping"" me move it. he went so fast i almost fell back with it  on top of me. i was mad at that point and told him that he was the one that was not appreciative and he needed to stop being an a-hole. he told me to take my dramatic a$$ back in the house and then yelled f-u and said he had nothing to appreciate. 

so i went inside and didnt help him for the rest of the day and finished the fence by myself the next day. 

so am i the a-hole for not helping??",Not the A-hole

  The next day was Tuesday I walked into school and started talking to the guy I liked, he was openly gay so people would say teasing things to us whenever we were together... my best friend would always laugh at these jokes knowing I was uncomfortable by them. At lunch, I was talking to some guys at my table about a game I just bought and my best friend brought up the conversation about the boy I liked saying "" He is so zesty "" pointing at him and shaking his head I told him to stop but he didn't he proceeded to call him slurs which I didn't like so I left the table and stopped talking to him he texted me when I got home saying how it was a joke and I should stop bitching about it but I didn't respond, I blocked him on every social media and I stopped going for basketball practice its been 3 months and I haven't talked to him yet.

AITA for calling my brother a selfish ass hole for taking my mom's phone all the time?,"I (19F) and my brother (20M) have been arguing recently because I keep calling him selfish for always taking our mom's phone. Our step dad recently bought her a new expensive phone that's much much better than ours (we have the same model) and it can run all the games he Wants to play that aren't supported on our phone.


He kept bugging our mom to let him borrow her phone for a ""few minutes"" and would end up playing games for HOURS. It has gotten to the point he has her phone basically all day and when he doesn't it's when he gets it to like 10% battery and she can't use it because it needs to charge.

My mom works a full time job and takes care of all the house work herself and always refuses my help so I can focus on my studies and because we live in an Asian household so ""males aren't supposed to do housework"" so my brother doesn't help out either. So the few hours she does have to relax she can't use her phone because of him and she's too nice to say no to him.

It's been a few weeks since this has been going on and I've been telling him nicely to leave her phone be but he never listens so I've started to be mean. I constantly call him selfish and an ass hole whenever I see him on her phone and sh*t on him for it. He says that he's not selfish because our mom is okay with it and that *I'm* the one whose the a hole because I'm ""causing problems for no reason"" and that I'm ""just jealous because he can use her phone and I didn't think to ask her first""

So I showed my brother all of these comments and he basically ignored every single one calling him the a hole and focused on the two that took his side 😅 and went on about how this proved that **I'm** the a hole not him and that I need to get out of his business.

AITA for being upset at my friends for abandoning me?,"English is not my first language. I(18F) was going to what's called a ""student party"" in my country which is a party meant for people in their last year of High School. Before the party, I and some other friends met up at a bar to get some drinks before the party. To remain anonymous I will call my friends Johanna, Anna, and three of me and Anna's coworkers, all of whom are 18-20y. For background, Anna and I have been friends for 12 years and best friends for 3 of those. Johanna and I are classmates and good friends. At the bar we had shots and beers and everyone was a bit tipsy, however I obviously was the most gone. I remember little after leaving the bar so the timeline is a bit messy. This has been retold to me by Johanna: after leaving the bar I could barely walk, Johanna took me to McDonald´s to get some food while the others just wanted to go party and leave me, Anna tried to get me to drink vodka while Johanna tried to get me to drink water, outside the studentparty I was denied entry and since the others knew I would likely get denied they had walked ahead of me and said they didn´t know me. Only Johanna stayed with me and eventually somehow I found myself in the subway alone and puked on the floor of the train I was in(disgusting, super sorry for the subway employees). Apparently only Johanna wanted to get me a cab but she only had 7 dollars on her, nobody else felt like paying for a Taxi or Uber(which I would have payed back) or a ticket to see that I got on the right train, Anna had used my ticket which I paid for to get to the bar so she had avoided paying before.

I got on a train going the other direction from the train I was supposed to take and got to the end station which is not the best train station to end up for a teenage girl. An older man and a lady took care of me, and then the police took me home. My parents were appropriately disappointed in me but the police said I´d been compliant and polite which lightened the blow.

Johanna had been super worried for me and she was on the way over to the station I was at but I was already in the police car. She also did feel super bad for what happened and we´re on good terms. Anna had been tracking my phone however made no attempts throughout the night to get me home safe, not even calling me. 

I know I am the a-hole for getting too drunk but I also feel like we had a deal as friends to take care of eachother in situations like these, especially as young girls in a vulnerable situation. I should have known better and I am disappointed in myself but so am I in their actions. (Believe me, I am mortified over how I acted). Anna, who was nowhere near as drunk as I was, put clubbing over her friend of 12 years safety. I have taken care of her before, held her hair as she was puking, had her vomit on my shoes and put my friends safety first.

So AITA for being upset?

Moral of the story is: If one person is too drunk, we get them home safe and then the party goes on. AND DRINK RESPONSIBLY!",Not the A-hole
AITA for buying myself McDonald's?,"This is my first time posting!

 So I (15f) got 200 dollars for Christmas. I hadn't spent it yet since me and my friends made plans to go to McDonald's after school once we got off of Winter break. The rest I planned on using for basic needs. 
Yesterday I had bought me and my friend McDonald's since I owed her back for buying me McDonald's. I had planned on asking my mom (35f) to take me to the store during the weekend to buy the daily needs for me. 

I had got home and started on my homework and started eating as well. My mom and my sister got home a little while later and came up to my room. My mom said her hellos and noticed the bag of McDonald's in a joking tone she asked ""Where's our McDonald's?"" I hadn't taken in consideration of them since it was just me and friends things. I explained to her I didn't get her any. She seemed upset by that and told me I needed to apologize to my sister (8f) for not thinking of her. My sister has money and she planned on saving it I think. I assumed she'd probably buy herself some food when she wanted to and let my mom know.

I felt like that was ridiculous but didn't say anything. My sister didn't even pay attention to my McDonald's. She said her hellos and went to play Roblox. She did not care at all or so I thought anyways.

My mom kept telling me I needed to apologize to my sister and her for not thinking of them. There's food in the freezer and fridge. So I didn't think of it as a big deal. I kinda brushed it off and just played Roblox with my sister once I finished my homework and my mom left back for work.

Today morning I had told my Nana what happened yesterday. Turns out she ended up telling mom and how she hurt my feelings. I wasn't hurt at all just found it ridiculous to apologize for buying myself food. I get a fee messages from my mom stating I'm an a-hole and selfish. How I betrayed her by talking to my Nana behind her back. She claimed she's gonna take my phone/electronics once she gets home and show me how tough life is and that things can't always be handed to me and she's tired of me acting the way I am. She says once she feels like not being selfish anymore she'll give me my electronics back. Which might be awhile.

So, tell me Reddit

Am I the asshole for not apologizing to my sister and mom and be considerate of what they're gonna eat while I enjoy some McDonald's?

Update: Okay so not much happened but I definitely have my devices. When my mom came last night I had asked to talk to her. We had talked for a bit and she explained she wanted me to open up to her and that she was just angry at the time and stressed out. Which granted I understand her for being stressed since her job is pretty tough and stuff. Anyways me and her talked and she told me she wasn't taking my electronics. 

I do appreciate the person who help me see her point of view on things. And I do appreciate people letting me know if I was the a-hole or not. Much appreciated from everyone! I do not plan on updating this anytime soon though! Have a nice day!",Not the A-hole
WIBTA for wanting dessert at Christmas?,"Okay, a little bit of context. I grew up in a well off family. I'm not saying we were beverly hills rich, but we have money and don't have to worry about budgeting, etc. I grew up with my Father (49M), Mother (50F), and younger brother (16M). I have struggled with eating issues, horrible anxiety, and PTSD from a relationship gone wrong, but that is another story.

Onto this story.

Christmas is coming up and usually we'd wake up in the morning, my Mom would have pillsbury cinnamon rolls ready on the table, we'd go into our living room, watch some christmas movie and open gifts together. Well, my father has banned basically any fun this year. He is a total health freak.

((List of things that aren't allowed in the house: Sugar, Chips (Potato, tortilla, veggie, any), Regular Soda, Cookies, Brownies, sweetener (like for tea and coffee, or only Truvia if allowed), most breads (Only basic breads are allowed, usually no bagels unless begged for them, not cinnamon swirl bread). The list goes on.))

Anyways, my Mom and I had to have our whole menu for Christmas ""approved"" by him. The one thing I wanted at Christmas, since I'm vegetarian and can basically only eat potatoes and brussel sprouts because of our menu), is a Pecan Pie. It's literally the one thing I asked for. When I asked for it on the menu, my Dad flipped. He started yelling about sugar consumption, and diabetes and that ""I won't have that crap in my house"". He said a word worst than crap, but I won't write it here. My Mom just looked around and said, ""Okay. That's fine."" I was angry.

I'm 21 years old, and I know that I'm not a child anymore, but our christmas has changed so quickly and without my brother and I being happy about it. My Mom wanted to get us stocking stuffers, usually it would be one of those christmas M&M tins or a chocolate santa. NOPE. Not this year. ""No candy. I'll throw it away."" My Dad said.

My Dad also said that we don't need any gifts this year really. ""You know Santa doesn't exist anymore, so you're lucky I'm even letting you celebrate this holiday anymore."" What?! Like, is Christmas going to disappear from my house completely in the next couple years! My Mom looked heartbroken when he said that.

My father yells about this stuff all the time. ""No This!"" or ""No that!"" or ""Get that crap out of my house or you'll pay."" Even if I bring a single Hershey's kiss into the house, I'm berated for being a ""pig"".

&#x200B;

So, I've decided to take dessert into my own hands and buy a pecan pie and hide it. I'll bring it out on Christmas, at the end of our meal. However, Would I be the A-hole for doing this?

&#x200B;

UPDATE:

I'm not going to bring the pie, especially since i do still live with my parents and I'm currently stuck with them since I only work part time (on weekends) and I am a full time student.",Not enough info
AITA for wanting to kick out my friends from our social media platforms?,"Okay so about 9 months ago I decided to start a bunch of accounts across multiple social media apps in which my friends and I would create content. I pitched the I idea to my friends and they didn’t seem to care for it all too much. I still went on to create the accounts anyways and began making videos. I started posing some of the videos I had made and they began receive tons of positive feedback. Reaching a combined following of nearly a million people across all platforms.

Once my friends saw the early success they joined in. We shared the account between the 4 of us, and all money we made was split evenly. While the accounts were technically shared by all of us it feels a lot more like I’m the only one who does anything. My friends offer little too no ideas for content, they refuse to be in almost every video, and any time I ask them to help in anyway they say they’ll just do it later; which they never do.

The moment I really started wanting to kick them out was when I was trying to make a video and my friends told me that they don’t feel like making videos. I got really pissed and told them how it’s so annoying that they wanna be part of the accounts and platforms but refuse to do anything for them, and that it felt like they were taking advantage of me. 

They just brushed me off and went on like nothing happened. They also often delete lots of my most popular videos, and when I confront them they say they did it because the video wasn’t good. At this point I want to remove them completely from all the accounts, as they literally do nothing but collect money that the accounts make. but I feel like it’s kind of a backstabbing thing to do.

So am I the A-hole for wanting to kick them out? And what should I do?",Not the A-hole
AITA for wanting my favorite flavor of cake for my birthday?,"I'm turning 22 in a few days and I have been asked what cake I would like. I wasn't expecting any cake because I'm an adult now and I have a 1 month old son, so I haven't put much thought into it. But I naturally answered that I wanted a red velvet cake because it was my absolute favorite and I don't get to eat it but like once in 5 years because I just don't think about it much. I don't eat sweets much (not counting pregnancy) so I was thinking, why not? 

Then I was given a lecture that I'm not the only one eating cake so I should get a flavor that everyone can enjoy. I understood this so I said why not get a vanilla or chocolate cake for everyone and then I can get a small 1st birthday type red velvet for me then. 

Then I was given a lecture about appearing selfish to the guests. And when I didn't want to back down and give up the red velvet cake I was accused of being an A-hole. 


I don't feel like I'm the A-hole here but I want to find out the truth. If I am the A-hole then I'll apologize and surrender the flavor I want and just have cake by myself a few days later or something.


Edit: the people asking then lecturing me is a tag team of 4 women who are not related to me. It's my boyfriend's bothers wife, her mom, her sister, and their friend.


Edit: (UPDATE) it's been 3 hours since I asked you guys AITA and according to the 200+ comments and advice I've gotten I can now say I'm NTA. Now I feel kinda sad that I wasn't able to recognize for myself that I wasn't the A-hole. I made this post to help me because I had such anxiety over it and felt horrible. My bf finally got home from work and when I told him he was livid. He called his brother to have a personal talk with him about his inlaws. I didn't want to cause any more drama but hopefully the little talk will help me not be treated like that in the future. 

Also to answer some of you guys questions and also to clarify. 

I can't uninvite them Because I didn't plan the party. I was just gonna spend my day watching tv and helping my newborn with his tummy time to strengthen his neck. My Bf's brothers inlaws were the ones that wanted to be ""nice"" and throw me a party since I never had one before. So I kinda felt like the A-hole because I didn't want to be rude to the people who were ""nice"" enough to throw me a party. 

Also I live with my bf and son in the basement of his brother and wife's house due to financial issues. So I'm forced to see her and her family very often. But we hope to be moved out by Christmas this year. 

THANK YOU ALL FOR THE JUDGMENT AND ADVICE! ❤️❤️❤️ Someone said I should just get my own big red velvet cake and eat it Infront of them while they had their ""boring"" cake 😂😂 I kinda want to do this but I also don't want to cause more drama. 

My birthday is August 19th so I might come back with an edit and let y'all know what I actually end up doing. Thank you guys!

Edit UPDATE BIRTHDAY 08-19-2022: 
so I ended up cancelling the party. I know they wanted to throw it for me but I just didn't feel like doing anything. I was already kinda upset in general about past birthdays and family forgetting me (close family like sisters and stuff) so I just stayed up till 5am watching the Goodfellas because I haven't seen it. Then I slept till 7 to feed my baby then slept till 12. Then I hung out with bf watching YouTube and eating left over pizza. Then he took me out to dinner with his brother, his daughter, his other brother, and her gf (she is my friend. It's not the one being mean over cake). The waitress became my friend, and then I drove home (I really wanted to drive..) everyone at dinner came over and then just as I was about to go to bed, everyone began to sing and a red velvet cake with my name on it came dancing out (bf was dancing lol) I wasn't expecting cake Because at that point I didn't care anymore. After cake I went to bed and that was the end of it ❤️ I had a blast. And the AH apparently got some karma, because she and the others got sick and wasn't in attendance. 

Thank you everyone for letting me know about whether or not I was the AH. Also thank you for all the recipes and advice!!! Also HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THOSE WHO HAVE THIS BIRTHDAY WITH ME!!!!",Not the A-hole
AITA- I hate her pictures,"My boyfriend wants to get couple photoshoot of us taken by his friend. He confirmed with her before letting me see any of her work, and it turns out I really do not like her editing style...  I asked if he would be comfortable asking her for unedited photos, or more natural looking photos, and he said that she really prides herself in her photography/editing skills. I really want us to get these photos done, because it means a lot to him, but I also really don't want to end up with photos that I hate. Would I be the A-hole if I were to talk to her when we get the photos done (or before) about not doing what she typically does? I see her work as a little childish, oversaturated, and I don't like that the backgrounds are all super blured out, while the people are the only thing in focus.

WIBTA for having a small wedding?,"Hello the internet! My fiancé and I are getting married in fall 2024 sometime. Context info: we were long distance for a while, we lived across the country from each other. Immediate family on both our sides is limited, we both have about the same amount of people on both sides. Him and I are both more introverted and have certain wishes for our wedding. (Ex. outdoor mountain setting similar to our first date, small guest list closer to eloping than a full blown wedding, tasteful but not too costly, etc..) We are paying for ALL of it. Neither of our families are contributing anything. We would like to keep it this way, as my family specifically likes to do the gaslighting thing where ""oh we have a portion of money in this, we should get a say in how it goes,"" blah blah blah -- after the money has been spent.

SO I get our guest list under fifty. 

I've wanted to elope for years. We are getting married shortly after I graduate from college, and he's not made of money either. Basically, we do not have the disposable income to have 100+ people at this wedding. And now, family I haven't seen/spoken to in years or flat out don't have a relationship with ""can't wait to receive their invitation."" And here I am like....who said you were invited? 

MY MOM. She believes that ""weddings are not about the couple, but about the unification of families."" While she isn't wrong, SHE ISN'T PAYING FOR ANY OF IT. 

Mom: You need to invite so and so, and your wedding CAN'T be child free because that's just a slap in the face to the couple. You can't invite this person without inviting his whole family. You can't just invite a few people from church, if you want to invite a few, you need to do ALL or nothing... but if you don't invite anyone from church, what's wrong with you?

I want to say, ""oh, you want those people there? Are you willing to pay the extra money to have more people at the limited space venue, or for their dinner? Would you pay for their accommodations if they whined about having to pay?""

I anticipate that this would get a rather spicy response from her and my dad. Accusing me (and my fiancé by extension) of disrespect, entitlement, selfishness, you name it. If it were up to my fiancé and I, we would have a small wedding, micro wedding even, reception with the same people, go on our honeymoon and come back and have a huge reception/potluck with everyone and their uncle who wants to be there. My family's response to this?

""Ugh.. you young people. You want to do none of the work and get all the gifts and praise. How can you expect someone to give you gifts if they aren't invited to the actual ceremony? That's so selfish, but that's just the problem with your generation. We must have done such a poor job in raising you to have you think that you can treat people this way,"" etc.

We didn't expect gifts.

AITA for not helping my sisters?,"My (half) sisters have always been a little bit shady and I have been estranged from them for several years.

3 years ago I found out through ancestry DNA that I had a different father than they did and one of them sweet talked their way into getting access to my account under the pretenses of copying the extensive family tree that I had built but instead she used that access to steal my information and take it to the attorney that was handling a wrongful death suit for their father and the man who was listed on the birth certificate, cutting me out of the settlement and they each got an extra $10k for selling me out.

The funny thing is, I married well and had no intention of committing fraud for a little bit of money that I didn't really need anyway and would have done the right thing because I have personal integrity. It galled me to no end that they would lie to me, steal my information and throw me under the bus for money that wasn't even life changing, for their own financial gain. I cut them all off because of that situation, knowing that I couldn't trust them again. They didn't notice because they were busy spending their windfall instead of saving some for a rainy day... The concept of family didn't mean anything to them at all.

Fast forward less than 2 years and their settlement money is gone, having been spent foolishly on old vehicles that don't run ( and her husband is too old and sick to ever fix them), a horse that never gets ridden and investing in cryptocurrency that went belly up.

My oldest half sibling with the junk cars has already been orbiting a new social media account that I made only a few weeks ago and I heard through a relative that another sister is ready to be tossed out of her apartment come the end of January for not being able to pay her rent since the tenant renting one of her bedrooms moved out.
I'm in the financial position where I could help with paying her back rent for her but I honestly don't feel any sort of way about it and I don't want to help someone who took advantage of me and didn't even feel bad about it. Not my problem.

AITA for telling my professor that they are unkind and unapproachable as a response to them saying I was victimizing myself after the loss of a friend/classmate?,"I will be sparing certain details as this is a throwaway, and I do not want to be doxxed.

I am in a university program and recently lost my closest friend and classmate. The loss of my friend was extremely shocking as I was in the hospital for a week, and they passed the day after I was released. Most of my professors have been understanding and have tried to help me as they did not want me to drop out. In my time here, I have been a 4.0 student. I am technically on a leave of absence right now as I am quite unstable at the moment (grief and health issues) and find it difficult to attend class. I have made an alternate schedule to complete my studies.

A classmate told me they were given extra credit at some point. When I inquired with the professor about it, they told me I chose to not attend class, so I would not be able to make it up. This was odd to me due to the circumstances and the fact that I was not given the option to complete an alternate assignment. I would also like to point out that I am on a leave of absence but am still completing the same work as my classmates. The professor began to speak to me in a rough manner, so I said, ""I feel like this is a bit unfair considering the fact that I am taking a leave of absence due to grief and health issues. I am not missing class because I want to but rather because I have to."" The professor accused me of victimizing myself and started speaking in such a volatile manner that I honestly just broke down. I told them that I felt like they were unkind and that other classmates and I had issues approaching them because of their rough demeanor. I tried to excuse myself from their office but the professor essentially yelled that I sit down to talk to them and told me that it was insulting that I made untrue claims about them. At this point, they back peddled and claimed that they would have eventually offered me another assignment, but I had not been patient enough to hear them say this. This is absolutely untrue. I asked about an alternate assignment and they shut me down within the first 30 seconds of our conversation. I am not sure why they chose to lie about this when they had even emailed me saying the same thing. At this point, I could feel a panic attack coming on so I said, ""I apologize and am genuinely sorry for everything, but I need to leave because I am afraid I will have a panic attack right now."" I only said this because they were still demanding that I sit down and talk to them. After saying this and grabbing the door handle, they went in for a hug and said, ""you don't have to hug back."" This caught me off-guard. I ended up having a panic attack for two hours after this encounter, and it was honestly very difficult.

The hug made me wonder if I misunderstood their intentions. Maybe that was their version of tough love? So am I the a-hole for calling them unkind and unapproachable?

And no, this is not the first bad encounter I have had with this professor.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not getting rid of my cat for someone,"

I have a cat that I rescued from an abusive household and my SIL and brother (who moved in with us because of covid) wanted me to get rid of it because my SIL has a phobia of furry things. I brought this cat home at a difficult time in my life and it helped me a lot. There were times when I'd think ""who will take care of my cat if I leave?"" and that was rly the only thing that helped me some days. I didn't want to give my cat to a shelter so I tried asking friends to host him for a while. Some had allergies, some landlords refused. it was taking longer than expected. In the meantime, we put a child gate to block the staircase so my cat wouldn't go down. My SIL requested the basement (bedroom, washroom, living room, only thing missing is kitchen) be given to her, so that she has more privacy (if it weren't for covid causing a financial strain, they wouldn't have moved with us). My parents agreed as long as everyone was happy. my cat never went down. When she came up, I'd take my cat to a room and chill there or go for a walk. that way, there was no interaction between them. However, my cat would bolt out sometimes when you opened the door to get in the room. those were rare but still scared her. Someone would tend to her and remove the cat from her environment immediately. She didn't think what we were doing was enough, so she kept requesting I get rid of it. 

While I was  looking for host families, I didn't wanna give it to shelters, especially because of his abusive past. In the meantime, I told her therapy can help with phobias and benefit her in general (she once quit a job because the boss wouldn't lock up his dog that roamed the office upon her request). She refused to go to therapy because ""she had seen the doctor enough"" because of health issues that led to hospitalizations, meds, etc. I understood that but she still didn't wanna do anything to help. she just wanted him out. It was hurtful because I was trying my best and they kept asking to get rid of my ""stupid cat"" as they thought it was more important than her for me. It rly wasn't. She was not helping me find solutions and often told me things like ""it's the least you can do for me"",""I know ppl who get rid of their 8 yo cats, you can do it too"".

I eventually moved out with my cat and we talked. She told me she wanted a new start, without any resentment. I agreed! I wanted nothing more than to get along (it was creating distance between my brother and I). Fast forward 6 months, I find out she's been shit talking about me saying I mistreated her, and that she was locked up in a room because of the cat. I was so sad. I cried a lot! this only shows there's still resentment and I can't help but wonder if we will ever recover from this. I don't think I did anything wrong I offered to help with therapy and she didn't wanna hear it. She didnt care to understand my side.

AITA for cursing my friend with whom I've been friends with for 5 years?,"I, female 16 have been friends with a girl (let's call her Amy) female 16 as well for almost 5 years. We met in 5th grade when she was getting badly verbally abused by our classmates because of the scars on her face due to an infection. At the time I was the only one to stand up for her and she was greatful for it. I never took credit for what I had done. All I wanted was for my now former friend to be able to be confident in herself and be able to stand up for herself. As asked, I taught her ways to handle any given situation as best as I could. I always made sure to be patient with her because I knew that unlike the rest her mentality was that of a child. She would always come to me ranting and I honestly never minded that. She would nitpick every little thing but I never took it too personally. That was until a few months ago. She suddenly started to become more and more ill-behaved. We were put in different classes so I wasn't always physically present to stop bad influence for her. I got continuous upsetting complaints that Amy had been hanging out with the 'bad type' of people who were intentionally teaching her bad words and bad things. Like wanting to smoke, cursing unnecessarily. I've been in our school for almost 13 years now and I've been my classmate's funniest plaything. I have several rumors to myself which i never cared for until they were fed to Amy to make her turn against me. One day I went to Amy's class to return a book I borrowed from a friend. And my guy friend in that class wanted a high-five so i gave him that. Amy looked at me disgusted and said I should learn how to be 'civilized' and a 'proper person' as if she wouldn't always act clingy towards me before the lockdown. This continued for many days until one day she blamed me saying i was the biggest reason why she was being harrassed. And that I'm disgusting, attention seeker and just outright pathetic. She said I was the worst person ever and that I always take Amy as immature. That genuinely hurt. All I did was try to help her. Even after the lockdown she'd come to my class when she came to school just to say hi to me and hug me. And that same person today called me disgusting. I honestly snapped at that point because not even a day before i was called a wh0re, disgusting lesbian and an attention seeker by my bestie with whom I've been friends with for over 12 years. So i started to curse at her. But I still felt bad because i know she was being badly influenced by others. So am I the a-hole here?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not letting my mom's bf sleep on my bed,"So my mom's bf came to our house once again to chat with my grandparents. Since it was raining heavily the man couldn't go home. My mom introduced her bf just a few days ago as he started to sleep in the living room with the guest matress frequently. The rest of my family approves of him but I don't due to the trauma my ex father caused me when he left us.

My mom came into my room and told me that the man would temporarily sleep on my bed while i have to squeeze myself with my mom and sister in a single bed in their room because the man said he couldn't sleep at all on the mattress even though I have slept a TON of times on that mattress and Still had a great sleep... OBVIOUSLY i said no because it was like letting a stranger sleep on ur bed and it disgusted me (i havent been exposed well to men who are in their late 40s except for my uncles ever since my father left me). Note to this story that the house is owned by my grandma and that my grandma knew NOTHING about my mom letting the man sleep on my bed. 

My mom kept giving me a glare and told me to lend it just for a night but i still refused. My sister then budged in and made everything worse as she said that my mom will not allow me to go out of the house even if its for school project purposes if i do not lend my bed. Ofcourse i didnt submit myself to that as i continued to refuse and stayed on my bed. My bed is the only thing that keeps me from the stupid outside world as well I also get possesive of what's mine. Im fine with friends and acquaintances but complete strangers is what despise.

At the end of the night my mom's bf still sleeps on the ground not in the living room but in the room of my mom and my sister's room. Still i have my bed the only comfort zone I have and 2 months of being grounded.

AITA for using my money won in a lawsuit on my college funds/expenses?,"Context: I (20F) am going to school at a university (this is important for context). My mom has not ever really supported the fact I wanted to go to a bigger school as she went to community college. About 2 years ago I was in a car accident and I decided to sue the person responsible for the accident (damages were over $10K, medical bills over $30k). My vehicle was beyond repair and insurance only offered me $1,500 after it was all said and done. I tried everything and I am left with severe neck and back pain. I also have trouble with strength in my arms and legs. The driver drove drunk and hit me going at an unreasonable amount of speed. It lead to my car flipping over multiple times and needing surgery after. 

Recently we went to court and although I only asked for $55K in court, the judge required him and his insurance company to pay $150K to me for damages, medical, and as personal relief as well. I just got the first part of the check on Monday and my mom insisted I give her the entire check ($25K) so she can have some spending money. After I told her no and told her I would be using it for college expenses as I still have three years left, she told me I am not responsible enough to handle it. I explained I am meeting with an accountant on Friday and we are going to open up an account specifically for this and I won’t touch the money unless I absolutely need to. She still didn’t like that and called me the a-hole for not giving her the check. Her biggest reason after I talked to my grandma was “I gave her life. I’m entitled to something”. I am really considering cutting contact with my mom if she continues to behave this way but I am wanting to better my future. So AITA for this?

Edit: Wow. Thank you all so much for the advice. I am blown away by this community I’m not gonna lie. You all have really helped me see what I thought I was in the wrong for. I did end up calling both an accountant and financial advisor and we have a game plan set for where money will be going. I also decided I am going to start a will in the event something were to happen to me. I have that attorney appointment next week. I am gonna be nice and give my mom something out of that but if she goes before me, I can easily have it fixed. On the other hand, my fiancé and I both had a sit down conversation with my mom. We not only showed her some of the comments on this post but explained to her the necessity of me still having an education and job after I get the last few checks. I am going to school to work in business/healthcare management so who knows…. In 10 years I could be a board member of a hospital or running my own hospital lol. Mom did finally see where she was in the wrong and apologized but that isn’t going to fix everything right now. I still don’t trust her but time will tell how she feels. Thank you all again for helping me because honestly I really felt like at some point I’d have to give her my money. So seriously everyone thank you!

Update: Hey y’all, it’s been a few months so I wanted to let you guys know my progress. My money is currently secure in a savings account that only I can access. It’s with a bank I do not typically bank with and no one but my MIL knows the name of the bank. She has been really supportive and helpful through this process. I have been making major progress in physical therapy and should be done by summer of next year. I also joined a sorority at my college and while I know probably not the best money move, the benefits outweighed the cons for me. My mom and I are also both going through intense individual and family therapy to help with our issues that have stemmed back for years before the settlement. So we are working things out but right now, I am not living with her nor am I financially supporting her. My fiancé (as of October) just found out we were pregnant and will be telling his mom on Christmas. We are very excited for what seems to be a bright future ahead of us. My financial advisor has also helped set up my account to where a small portion was put into a stock that is doing really well at the moment and I plan to sell it before the recession.

AITA for blaming my classmate for taking over the table space and only caring about himself?,"To start this off, neither me nor Olivia thought we were the a-holes originally, but lately, we were second-guessing ourselves and wanted an outside opinion.

I share my history class with two friends, Olivia and Gemma. The teacher, Mrs. Rouse, was nice enough to give the students the freedom to sit next to our friends, and since she (exceptionally) allowed three people at our table, it's not surprising that I chose to sit next to Gemma and Olivia.

Later in the year, Gemma became closer to someone else who was also in the same class, and asked the teacher to move to their table. Since there was an empty spot, a guy named Pal (someone I and Olivia didn't necessarily get along with) replaced Gemma. From the get-go, Pal started fights, this included how we divided the space. Me, Olivia, and Pal shared a rectangular table, with two seats on the length of the table and Olivia sitting on the width section which made it hard to equally divide the space considering how there isn't enough room to fit three seats on the same side of the table me and Pal sat on.

Since Pal wanted ""equal space"", he divided the table in HALF using duck tape while we were gone (while we had a sub). He gave half of the table to himself, and gave me and Olivia the other half of the table, which was really unfair and gave me and Olivia very little space to ourselves.

Once we saw the tape, we immediately started arguing because I and Olivia only had HALF the space he had (To give you an idea about how much space we had, Olivia and me didn't have enough space to place an average-sized school-provided Chromebook and notebook at the same time).

Once we started arguing, he said that it was ""technically"" not his fault because there were not supposed to be three people on a table and that this was fair because it ""wasn't his fault"" that he was here (We never said it was). After he said this, we told him that he agreed to switch with Gemma and come here so it was not our fault either. We also said that there were no arguments about space before he moved here.

We also said that the specific reason there are three people on this table was because there was not enough tables to fit two people on them equally so we couldn't get two people on this table even if we wanted to (mind you, he was offered if he wanted to move once we brought the teacher into this, and he declined).

After arguing about this and him pushing our stuff behind the tape boarder he created, we called over the substitute to handle it. Once she arrived, she understood our situation and asked Pal to move, still, he fought every step of the way and said ""It's not technically my fault"" maybe four times during the event. Because the substitute was not assertive enough, she only got him to move the tape TWO inches to the right, with him giving us the side eye after the sub walked away (We still have no space).

I and Olivia are still mad about this because there is not much we can do. But we also contemplated if we made the right choices throughout this. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not letting my family come watch my karate tournaments?,"My (37M) sister (38F)asked to come watch me compete at my karate tournament. I told her I don’t want her or friends come watch because it’ll make me nervous. 

She’s mad that I’m okay with spectators and my gym mates come watch, but honestly they don’t make me nervous. 

Now she’s upset and says she needs time to cool and won’t talk to me. My family doesn’t really care much, it’s just her…

I’ve looked it up. People in tournaments get extra nervous when family comes to watch. 

Am I being the a-hole here?

AITA for lecturing my older brother after he told his boss I was pregnant?,"While I(27F) was on the phone with my older brother (31M), my brother revealed to me that his boss pulled him aside at work last night, asking him why he had been looking so nervous all shift. (He's a school janitor) 

For a little backstory: I used to work where he currently does, although before he started there and in a different position (monitor), but his boss was once my boss as well and we weren't exactly besties. 

He info dumped to her pretty much everything going on in his personal life that was making him nervous in general before revealing the real WORK RELATED reason why he was so anxious. 
The info dump included me moving halfway across the country and that I am pregnant and when I was due!

I had to calm myself before stating how much I did NOT appreciate him telling his boss, my former boss, about my personal life and how he had no business telling his boss about his own personal life either. That she might even take advantage of it some day and use it against him.
 ""Plus, again, why are you telling your boss about your personal life anyway? Why did she feel the need to ask you what you were anxious about? That is none of her business! You should have stated as such and left it at that. Or even just stated the work related reason, and then left it at that. She doesn't need to know about my life!""

Well, according to my mother, who heard the conversation as the phone was on speaker, I was too hard on him and now he's worried. 

I said.   ""Well, it's just something you shouldn't do. I got written up for 'showing off my engagement ring' to the students at the school, when all I did was WEAR MY ENGAGEMENT RING TO WORK'. So if I was in trouble something as simple as that, what makes you think it's safe to info dump your personal life to your boss?"" 

She said, ""ok, Spookybeagle, just move on. You're making him upset.""

It's been bugging me all day now. So... yeah, was I the a-hole here?

Update: I apologized to my brother for how harsh I was. I explained calmly how uncomfortable it had made me when I he spoke to his boss about me. He said he understood and we have moved on. Thank you for all the responses from both sides and points of view. 

I don't want to just blame hormones, but I have been extremely touchy and emotional lately as I am in my 3rd trimester, so that may or may not have had something to do with how I responded to him. 
Again, thank you for the comments.",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to gift my friend's kids for Christmas?,"I'm still in moderate touch with a school friend but not to the level where I share too much about me. She came to where I lived over a decade ago while I was just out of my pneumonia. Honestly, I wanted to hang up when she called. I told her I was sick but her response was ""take your medicine so that we can hang out"".

We had generally a good time, even better than I thought.I was moved to send her kids some gifts the following Christmas. She never even ask about my kids, which is fine, but I'm talking about being reciprocate. She has 6 kids. Tbh, I wasn't expecting a gift for my kids nor was she obligated. 
However, she got the gifts and didn't even tell me that she'd received them. Didn't even say thank you. 
Instead, she sent me a huge laundry list of things I could do for her, so I refused. We lost touch for years.

She's now getting in touch again, but I'm not enthusiastic. She's in a very bad financial situation and asked me if I could send her presents so her kids can open something for Christmas. I said no. I'm on a budget and I need to take care of myself. She burst into tears. Her husband's best friend found me on LinkedIn and sent me about 15 messages before I blocked him. He accused me of ruining her hopes and of being cruel and selfish. I feel like I maybe the a-hole because all she wanted was some presents a didn't ask for money. AITA?

AITA for lying about my weight,"I've been anorexic for a long time now. My family has never really shown much support. I'm supposed to be in recovery now, trying to get my period back. My parents are continually making caustic comments whenever I'm trying to eat, such as ""wow, you're going to eat all that?"" or ""I thought you only feed on air"". Additionally, whenever I'd end up losing weight, my mother would threaten to throw away all my books, cancel my chemistry course etc. She used to do weekly weight checks. All under extreme duress. When I'd refuse, she'd just yell and insult me until I gave in. At one point she demanded I gain 5 kg in one week, or else she'll send me to therapy and force me to take hormones. We had a long talk about how it makes me feel scared to be in my own house. It ended with her allowing me to check my own weight, as long as I report it to her right after. I try really, really hard. Sometimes I eat until my stomach is so full it feels like it's going to explode. I try to eat sweets, but it's hard, mentally. She forces me to eat those. Sometimes I only pretend that I do, but in reality I just hide them somewhere in my drawer. I have to push myself to gain back weight that I lost along with my whole life. My friends left me. My family nearly hates me. I will not be cured with the snap of a finger. It's not as easy as just shoving food into my mouth. In spite of all my efforts, I'm not gaining any weight. I cannot tell my mother, I am utterly terrified of her reaction. I lie that I'm gaining. Two days ago she told me she wanted to see it for herself. I said no. She got terribly angry and told me not to talk to her anymore. After that I cried for about an hour. She came into my room and, despite her previous remark, we had quite the cathartic talk about eating disorders. She's calmed down since then. I was supposed to check my weight again yesterday. I lost a kilo, but I lied that I gained a half. She said she trusts me and is glad that I'm getting better. That broke me. I feel like I'm in much more of an impasse now. I don't want to tell her the truth and break that temporary trust, or possibly trigger her rage. I feel terrible guilt, but then again I don't have any good options. Am I the a-hole for faking my own recovery and tricking my parents into thinking I'm getting better?

Edit: I have discussed therapy with my mother before. My physician suggested family therapy when my mom went to her, alone, without my knowledge, and described my situation most inaccurately, because that was easier than having me come with her and share my experience. I know about this because she apprised me of this pseudo-appointment a few days later. She told me that I was ruining the family, as our lives were supposedly centered around dealing with my disorder. Also that I'd screw my father over, because he'd have to leave his workplace to attend the sessions. All my fault, basically. I say this to give you a brief idea of why exactly I do not have a choice to safely seek professional help. I'd have to go through my mother first, and she wouldn't let me take private sessions.",Not the A-hole
AITA for standing up to my assistant manager,"Hi All, this is my first post so I’m hoping it goes well,

So to get into it me (25f) and the assistant manger (m30ish) at the pub I work in in England have been clashing at work and I now wonder if I’m being a arse  or not.

To give more context I’m a supervisor and service couch it’s my job to try to improve customer experience etc, He’ll come in and proceed to talk down to me and expects me to just say yes when I don’t do that I will question things if I think they can be done better.

Today when I finish my shift and clock out he decided he wanted a chat with me where he complained that I always “argued” with him when in my opinion if we’re they only two managers on shift I’ll tell him my ideas to try to make it smoother, point one being he complained that I didn’t count out starter forks for him weeks ago because I said I didn’t think there were enough there were, I did not think there were because the last time I counted them there were only 20, I’d spent 2 months helping another pub and did not know we’d got new ones and at the time I was looking after the whole restaurant (30 tables) and the pass so wasn’t really paying attention. He also does not like the fact that I won’t always say yes to him (see where I mentioned my job role) I don’t because sometimes it’s unreasonable for example walking at at 23:30 when we’re closed and everything is cleaned down ready to leave dropping the bomb that we need to moved like 10 tables etc around in the function room which the tables are heavy and stored in an awkward place when he could have told us 2 to 4 hours ago. 

I’m sorry for the longish rant, personally to me he talks to me like I’ve never worked at our pub I started before him and I’m not the only one who’s annoyed by him, he will also disappear for ages at a time on shift when we’re busy or need help he’s just gone one our joke questions now is “where is blank” we all know there’s no point asking as he doesn’t say anything but I digress my point is am I the a-hole for what I did today which was I did not do as much as I normally do I didn’t close the garden (we have a huge garden) or the pass (kitchen front of house) or the restaurant(relay it etc) or made sure all the cutlery was done before I finished at 22:30 which I normally do aside from other things because I wanted to prove a point (the team were on my side, I told them I was doing this) about what I do which he them decided to wait until I was out of the door to have a “chat” he decided to complain about pervious point I’ve mentioned and would not listen when I tried to talk saying “no no no” you get it, last thing he also threatened to get my hours reduced now I don’t think that will happen coz got a good boss man it is a worry thou. So am I the a-hole? I’m happy to answers questions just don’t want to go on and on haha and will up date.

AITA for thinking I shouldn't have to pay half the gas money for a trip when I saved my sister $300 by letting her stay in my room with me?,"My sister and I were going to the same destination for a family gathering. I had my room (which I chose to pay with my credit card rewards points). My sister and her significant other was getting their own room. A few days before we were to leave my sister's significant other decided not to go so my sister asked me if she could stay in my room with me so she didn't have to get a room for just herself. I said OK since it would save her right at $300 for the 2 night stay. She asked me how much she had to pay me for her part of the room since she was staying with me and I told her she didn't have to pay me anything but if she wanted to she can buy me dinner for one of the nights. Which she never did. Originally I was going to drive my vehicle and she and her significant other was going to drive their vehicle. Turns out since it was now just the two of us, we ended up car pooling as well in her car. Now she's saying that I should pay her half of the gas money it took for the trip.

AITA for getting my ex friend kicked out of our friend group due to my service dog?,"Hi everyone, 

Update: from what everyone has said I am clearly NTA. Thank you all for your concern and well wishes. Ana and her family have been blocked and I will no longer be in contact with her. 

It was also brought up to me by another user that their was a similar post posted a few weeks ago from a hosts perspective. This is NOT the same post. My situation happened really recently (allot more recent than whatever the previous post was) I’m shocked to hear this has happened befor, but yeah it’s 💯 not related to ours haha


Finally I’ve had a few comments about my dog being “certified” that I want to clarify. I am not from the US so I’m unsure what your guys process is like, but all I mean is that Bailey has gone through the required testing, training and registration to ensure she is legally aloud to be classified as a service animal :) 


I just want to start by saying I’m pretty sure I’m not the A-hole. But my friend and her family are pretty certain that I am. Please bear with me, I’m just wanting some clarity over this situation to make sure I’m not crazy.

I (24 f) have epilepsy. I have a service dog (fully certified) who is trained to help me with my seizures. I have been diagnosed since a child, and I have had my current dog Bailey for 4 years now and she is the bestest girl around. (Before Bailey I had a previous service dog who we had to retire due to age… but having a service animal is by no means new for me). With her being a service dog she is obviously always with me. 

I have a core friend group who hangs out quite often. My one friend; let’s call her Anna) (also 24f) always makes really weird and almost passive aggressive comments about me and Bailey? Ex; dogs shouldn’t come to restaurants, I’m inconveniencing people, etc. she doesn’t get that I legitimately need her for my own safety. It’s not just for show.

My seizures are really regular; for context I actually get two different kinds. My “small ones” are petit Mal seizures. This essentially just looks like I’m zoning out and staring into space. Quite often people who don’t know me wouldn’t even connect this. My “big ones” are my main concern; these are focal seizures where I fully lose consciousness. This can happen a couple times a day for me so it’s obviously really important that I manage it to the best of my abilities. 

Anyways. Our friend Anna wanted to host a games night/appy night type thing at her house. When we there she lost it on me. She told me it was increadibly disrespectful that I showed up with Bailey without asking for permission first. That I can’t just assume people will be happy with a dog always being around. That I should have just stayed home if I couldn’t handle being out for a few hours without Bailey. I tried apologizing and pointing out that I assumed she knew I was bringing her since I’ve never gone anywhere without her. That set her off more. The guys were finally able to calm her down but her “compromise” was I had to put Bailey in the backyard.

I was an idiot and said fine because I didn’t want to inconvenience anyone more or continue stirring the pot. Bailey went out side and I returned inside with my friends. 

I ended up having a seizure, blacking out and smashing my head on the floor. I had to go to the hospital because of how hard I hit my head. 

I guess my friend group absolutely handed Ana her ass calling her hateful, toxic, and a jealous witch. I guess she was trying to say that I passed out for the attention and I got my way like always. Long story short no one wants her around anymore.

Since this happened her, her sister and mom have been blowing up my phone, calling me the ass hole and demanding I fix this situation and it’s honestly getting to me.. so Reddit. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not having enough money to pay for my friends court fees?,"To give y’all some information I’m a 16 year old female and the girl I’m talking about is a 19 year old female and we’ll call her Ashley. Me, Ashley, and our guy friend (16 year old) we’ll call him Joe decided to ditch church one morning and drive down to this party around where Ashley lived. Ashley lived about an hour away in a different county and would drive down to the church almost every Sunday. Anyways as we’re at the party Joe brought up some skate park thing he heard of that was built in a school that was around the area and Ashley said “oh yea that’s a 2 minute walk down the road wanna go there?” And ofc he agrees and we head down there. We go to this abandoned looking school that apparently Ashley went to at one point and she even told us that it had been abandoned for years now and Joe said it too so I went with them. While we’re there I’m looking at all the broken windows and graffiti and like every teenager does I climbed through one of the broken windows and I look inside for a bit and while I’m inside Joe picks up a rock and smashes the window. We were so far we couldn’t hear the alarms going off so we just kept exploring and they couldn’t fit through the window so they asked me to open the door to let them in. Anyways end of story the cops showed up and since Ashley was an adult she got arrested or charged with trespassing and has to go to court but she can’t afford it. I forgot to mention that me, Ashley, and Joe are apart of a bigger group but the group didn’t go with us but she told them the whole story and they all started yelling only at me and called me a selfish asshole for not wanting to pay her court fee after I told them many times I didn’t have the money which is true because my parents are currently trying to get a divorce but this friends group is so toxic and they’re all brown because of the Filipino in them but since I’m half white and half Filipino my skin is white and they’ve always almost hated me for it saying I wasn’t Filipino enough even though I act just like them but after I told them I didn’t have enough money because of financial problems they continued to call me a selfish asshole and they only called me that out of the 3 people that went so am I the a-hole for not having the money to pay for my friends court fees?

EDIT: Yes I know what I did was stupid and wrong and I’m not saying what I did was right it was breaking in and entry (I did not vandalize anything the window was already broken when I got there) but I literally don’t have any money to pay this girl",Not the A-hole

I m14 got mad at my dad and sister (f17) for playing on my ps5 on my weekends while she doesn’t have school and can play at anytime between 11 pm to 4pm(17 hrs).

Let’s get into detail here,about a month ago my sister who let’s call jess(not her real name) got into playing apex legends as a hobby while playing on my ps5,I personally had no problem with this as it was either while I’m studying,at school or asleep and she made no noise,2 weeks pass by and my parents get me mw2 as an early Christmas present bc they knew I really wanted the game,I had about a  week left on my ps plus subscription before I needed to renew it here comes 2 days ago. Thursday came and, (I’m in a Arab country so Friday and Saturday are weekends) I wanted to hop on mw2 all going well but noticed I couldn’t play multiplayer as my ps plus ran out.but my parents refused to buy it since they bought me mw2,no problem I’d pay for it using my own money my parents agreed to buy it for me the next morning.it’s 11:30 pm and my dad tells me if I don’t let my sister play before 12:00 midnight they wouldn’t buy me ps plus.yet I had a complaint as I just finished my hw and studying sesh and wanted to relax and then came the big arguement.long story short,my dad and sis yelled at me.12 midnight came by and my dad was asleep and my sis kept yelling at me to play and I ignored her as I was in the middle of an ow ranked game since I needed to focus,a new round began and she left the room and didn’t come back.”GET UP OR ELSE” I heard my dad yell at 5 am and she told my dad that I didn’t let her play even though I told her to wait 10 minutes and she left the room and didn’t come back,not my fault is it? My dad screamed and told me that he wouldn’t be buying me ps plus and would be taking away my ps5 for a month and giving my sister it and my monitor for the time being.but my mom stepped in and said what is happening and after I explained she told me I’m right and my sis and dad were the a-holes,in addition she said girls aren’t supposed to be playing video games,she has to study for college next year and she has 5 days a week where I’m gone for 12 hours at school plus the time I’m studying and doing home work and it should be my call as I paid for the ps5 using my own money and now my dad is treating me like garbage and my sis is completely ignoring me.and now I feel like the a-hole but I don’t know.

"AITA 12 hour drive ""favor""","This morning as I was getting ready for work I received a Facebook Messenger message at like 6am. This is from a ""friend"" on Facebook, this is someone I went to church with for a few years about 10 years ago. We are friendly on Facebook liking and occasionally commenting on each others posts. But I haven't seen this women in person in 10 years. 

The message asked me if I could do her a favor, I said I would love to if I was able to. 

She tells me she is getting custody of her son today. 

She then proceeds to ask me if I still live in ""the state I live"". I said yes. She said that she needs a ride from her home town, to the town I live in, back to her home town, and she needs the ride today. 

She then asked if she could call me, and I said no I was almost at work and couldn't talk, but would keep messaging her.

I googled where she told me she lived. It is a 3 and a half hour drive to her town. This is the amount of time google said it would take, not taking into account: bathroom breaks, gas fillups, traffic or anything straight time 3 and a half hours. 

So what she needed me to do, was drive 3 and a half hours to get her, pick her up. Drive 3 and a half hours to get her son, and then drive her and her son back 3 and a half hours. THEN I would need to drive myself home the last 3 and a half hours. So it would be over a 12 hours day of just driving, and she said that she is short on cash, so she would not be able to chip in for gas or food or anything.  

I told her that I was very happy about her getting custody of her son, but that I had work today, and that there was no way that I could help her today. 

She then became upset and said. ""You told me you would do me a favor."" Which I went back to the message and I saw that I said, ""I would love to if I am able to."" 

And I told her I was sorry but that this is last minute and I have work and I couldn't miss an entire day, minutes before I was suppose to show up. 

I don't feel like I am the a-hole in this situation, but the way that she reacted to me telling her I couldn't help her makes me feel like I am...

WIBTA for telling my friend that it's weird she's asking me for money?,"So we're all scholarship students (F23) and are looking for a place to live. We just met a couple of months ago and got along pretty well so decided to move in together. Searching for a place has been tough and everything has been out of budget. We finally increased our budget and found a place that we all liked and tried booking it but were rejected. So now we have to book our second choice which has a lot of administration non-refundable fee that are really going to strain our pockets. 

Now some of us got a larger initial stipend (me) and some got a smaller one but our monthly income is the same. I'm paying much more than this girl because I'll have a bigger room and It's going to be tough on all our pockets.

When we decided we're going with this place she became upset and started doing a lot of calculations on my notepad. Then suddenly looked up and said can you pay my deposit for me. I was a bit shocked and told her that we have the same monthly income and even if the initial payment was more we've had the same savings since and it shouldn't affect. She then went on to claim how she can't use her savings (apparently she set it aside  for her brother who paid for her ticket but he hasn't asked her for the money and most probably won't in the future too). 

I feel a bit weird about how quickly she asked me for money. A mutual friend pointed out that while I said nothing wrong, it would have been better to ask more questions rather than pointing out how weird her behaviour is. The conversation ended with me telling her that I just think it's good to clearly communicate problems especially mutual financial funds and she said she really appreciated it and would try to not borrow money but if possible we should give it to her.

AITA for cussing my mother out?,"I have been working in a convenience store for 5 months now and have been saving up my money. During this holiday season I to buy myself a laptop. To add context, I was never given much as a child. No sports, no technology, basically only the necessary things like food and a bed that every kid should get so buying a laptop is a big deal for me as I've never owed one before. So with my hard earned money in hand I went to our local bestbuy and bought myself a laptop. All good right? Well, the second I reach my house I get the laptop ripped out of my hands by my mother. Reminder that she has never taken interest in anything I've done before. I proceeded to  get angry at her (probably not my best move) and take my laptop back out of her hands. I refused to return it to her as she yelled at me that I am not allowed to have one. I argued with her that she has never cared about what I have done up until this point and that I was spending my own money on something I wanted. But because I am her child under her roof, she can do whatever she wants with it and I have no right to own it. For context, I am a 17yo male who's 18th birthday is in 3 weeks.

WIBTA for discontinuing a story series a relative has come to consider a highlight of the holidays and their birthday when it's not a huge effort to write?,"**TL;DR Twice yearly I write custom short stories of about 3000 words of so for a close relative. I've been doing this 10 years and I've run out of ideas, motivation, and interest. I know my relative really loves these and it makes their birthday and Xmas (which are thankfully 6 months apart) and they don't have much else going on in their life? It's not a huge effort, WIBTA if I informed them post-Xmas story delivery that this is the last one?**

I am a hobby writer. 10+ years ago I was broke so for a close relative's bday I wrote a very short story that was a playful lighthearted them-insert. I enjoyed it and the relative was over the moon. 

The next few years I had a blast taking scenarios from this person's life and embroidering them, coming up with new angles and ideas, and putting a lot of heart and soul into them. 

However the past 5 years or so my relative has gotten painfully religious and has slowly wound down anything in their life outside of religion including reading secular books, watching secular tv, and so on. The hobbies and interests that made it easy to draw inspiration for the stories are gone and her point of view and tastes and tolerance has narrowed considerably to the point I feel I'm tap dancing around religion, especially in Xmas themed stories. I'm not religious and I don't endorse or support her religion so it's always a struggle to find a way to be respectful and hint or allude without appearing to give my stamp of approval and show interest. 

Adding to that, I'm writing commercially now and trying to build a back catalog with an eye towards pivoting out of the corp world at some point, so the well is a bit dry and the novelty of dashing off a 3000 word story in a few hours is VERY over. 

The only reason I don't just shut this down is that the relative makes a big fuss prior to the expected delivery and is on FB bragging as it gets closer and I know they've come to really hype it up and look forward to it. I lost my dad recently and it seems petty to not do something that makes a close relative so happy and doesn't require moving mountains. But still...

As I'm writing this I realize I got myself into this as a kid making a hand drawn fashion magazine for my sister and couldn't figure out how to wind it down so I pretended the company got bought out, heh.

Even if they had started dating in a ""normal"" way (like, not cheating) I'm not sure I would want to invite someone I met only a few months prior to the wedding day (I've been planning my wedding for longer than I've known this person!). Also knowing that this new girlfriend really hurt my ""ex-sister-in-law"" and the fact that she is the main reason she won't be there not there, would make me really mad and sad every time I saw her at the reception. I'm so mad at my brother too, cause what he did is awful. The only reason he is still in the wedding list is because I know my mother will start drama if I don't invite him.

I don't think I'm the a-hole, but my brother and my dad are calling me a bridezilla and my mother is telling me I'm ruining the day for her. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for changing my PSN password because I fell like my poor friends bank,"First of all I want to apologise for any misspellings I’m autistic with writing problems 

Last year I (m16) bought myself a ps5 took me a long time to get it but I managed to get one. I was the only one in the friend group with a ps5 so they expected me to get all the games they wanted to play, me being a new student and wanting to make friends that was exactly what I did. 

Half a year later one of my friends (m16) got a ps5 (I found that surprising because he can’t afford air conditioning in his house) we were both excited to play together so we each got a game and played together. Fast forward to last September I pre-ordered all star battle  R we both wanted to play so we came to his house and I got my psn as a guest and downloaded the game after the friend found out you can have two consoles with one account he got excited know he can play all of my games any time he wants I told him I feel uncomfortable but he kept begging me so I left it there 

Fast forward to last week there were no problems with the two consoles and we met in my house to play together and he just started asking me when I will continue buying him games while adding them to my wish list the day after at school I asked him to help pass a level at cuphead so he started calling me a little b and stuff like that so in response I said “this little b still buys your games” he immediately said “I can afford it but I’m too lazy to buy them” so when I came home I changed my psn password so won’t be able to reach my games 

Will I be the a-hole if keep it that way? 
On one hand he poor and can’t afford it and he’s also my best friend 
But on the other hand I feel used and why buying a console you know you can’t afford.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not getting my brother & SIL a Christmas present?,"I (37F) am the oldest of my 3 siblings (33F, 32M, 29F). My brother was basically the golden child bc he's the only boy, so he grew up to be an inconsiderate, selfish prick and his (30F) wife is no different.
Shes very passive-aggressive, manipulative & controlling. Mutual friends (who know SIL's ex) have warned me about her prior to my brother marrying her, letting me know she's the type to get competitive and manipulative with her SO's family members. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt but they turned out to be right.

Shes disrespected my family before (in passive aggressive ways). No one actually likes her but they just tolerate her for the sake of civility, but for some reason I don't have the same ""strength"" & patience to keep it up. It really seems like we can't even go 2 months without her being a b*tch somehow.

My brother and I have recently gotten into (another) argument bc I called out something shes done, she then decided to play victim and run to him, he then msgs me berating me with irrelevant insults. I truly feel he belittles me like that to prove something to her and it's disgusting. For some context; he says he doesn't care about me, he's told me I deserved the abuse I've endured as a kid etc. 

My family agrees SIL & Brother were in the wrong and told them so- but they also told me to be more tolerant and let things go. For now they've been having my brother & I over on separate days to avoid eachother, but I feel like they think this is just temporary. 
I really would like to go NC with bro & SIL for good as I really can't stand their personalities. The way he acts triggers some mental health issues for me and it woild give me a huge peace of mind to make it clear (to them & the rest of the family) that I want nothing to do with the 2 of them, ever.

My parents will likely host 2 Christmas dinners to keep us separate. I don't want to get SIL & Bro any Christmas presents bc I want to make it clear to not consider me as family moving forward.
It feels really petty and immature but I feel like that by doing so, it would make it clear to everyone that I want NO association with Bro & SIL for good. That will somehow give me some peace of mind in the future. Would I be the A-Hole if I didn't get them a present to prove a point?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not wanting to spend time with my divorced father?,"NOTE: Pardon if I make a lot of grammatical mistakes or such things - I’m writing this at 2am.

My (15F) parents (46F and 47M) have been divorced for almost 3 years now, but over the last year I have discovered a lot of things about my father that have made me see him in a totally different light (and not in a good way).

He has always been a very narcissistic and strong-mouthed(?) character, and it’s the same with his parents and his brother and etc. When my parents first divorced, I tried to look at the bright side of things and fell into my father’s manipulative traps of “your mother is the villain” and “her and I could have worked this out” yada yada, without even realizing it at first. But over the last year I’ve seen through his BS, and the way he talks to me and my mother and the way he talks about my family is unacceptable.

Matter of fact, he has been diagnosed by a CERTIFIED PSYCHOLOGIST that he has NPD (Narcissistic Personality Disorder) and sociopathic behavior. I’m not saying people with these disorders are bad or evil, but him and his actions specifically as a person and the way he thinks he’s entitled to everything and his god-complex clearly reflects this on him.

Essentially, he continuously calls me a liar, a hypocrite, ‘good at being manipulative’, and that I only use him for money. None of it is true, but I can admit I have been withdrawing attention and loving behavior from him simply because I’ve had enough and I can’t lie to myself anymore. AITA?

TLDR; My father has cruel behavior, and it gets under my skin; but I want to know if I am the a-hole for “not loving” him anymore or not wanting to spend time w him and being cold towards him, even if he is my father?",Not the A-hole
AITA for being cold?!?,"Hi! So… In my country we have huge problems with inflation. Electricity is 60% more expensive than a year ago. And so the heating. Here is the issue. Schools don’t have money, so we have instead of having normal 22° celsius (72° fahrenheit) we have around 16-17° celsius (around 62° fahrenheit) in class. We sit in winter jackets, some people have even blankets around them. The heating control is blocked, so we can’t move with it.
My problem is here: I have low blood pressure so I’m naturally even colder than other people. And let’s be honest they are also really cold. So today, I had my jacket on as always and my boots and not my “overshoes”. We are supposed to change our shoes, but for the last 2 weeks I didn’t cause I was so cold. Always when teacher asked me why I’m not wearing my school shoes I said I’m cold and they let it be. But today we had lesson with that one btch, who just can’t stand me. She hates me so much. And I never did anything wrong, I’m always the good girl who talks to teachers with respect. For example: I’m perfect in presentations and I still got the worst mark from the whole group. Absolutely unreasonably. Everybody said it was unfair but I just let it be. 

Today, we had lesson in attic class, where is even colder than in the rest of the classes. I ofc had my jacket and boots on. She told me, that I’m not supposed to wear boots in school, and to take them off. I said no. She told me again. And I said no. She told me again. I responded “I will start wearing my school shoes when this school starts the heating.” Well, after few minutes of arguing I took them off. I wanted to cry because of how cold I was. 

And as finale of the day, my class teacher (Every class has her main teacher who deals with their problems, absence, etc,… I don’t know if this is a thing in other countries, that’s why I’m explaining it) came and asked who had that “stupid argument” with that particular teacher. I, without shame, admited to it. I’m the apple of my class teachers eye, so she just said to don’t do it again.

So, I’m I the a-hole for being cold and refusing taking off my shoes?


Ps: I would definitively talk with our principal about the heating or teachers behaviour, but I’m in the senior year and doing the maturity exams and don’t want to “come into a cross” with them. If I would be junior, I would already have the letter written…",Not the A-hole
AITA for threatening to no longer pack my husband's lunches?,"My (f26) husband (m26) works long days. Pretty much 7AM-6PM, sometimes even later. (He is a utility locator, if that's helpful. And spring-summer is the busiest time.)

He sets his alarm for 5:30 AM. Every morning. Even on weekends because he is fearful of it not working when it needs to. No matter how many times I try to explain that you can set a schedule for it.

We don't actually get up right when the alarm goes off, we generally push snooze until it's 6 or 6:30. His workday starts whenever he gets in his company vehicle and drives to a ticket.


Why he sets it for 5:30 is a mystery. I am not a morning person, and he is the one who presses snooze.

I repeat, I am not a morning person. And lately, I have been having trouble sleeping. Yet my husband insists that I get up with him so I can make his work lunch. 
Well, today, I had a particularly hard time getting up. And while getting up, I was in a fog. So I moved slower than normal. I had decided to give him leftover pasta salad and make him a sandwich to go with it.
Whilst I was in the kitchen, he recieved 3 emergency calls. Which meant he had to leave before I could finish packing his lunch. I hadn't even pulled out the salad yet due to having trouble finding any deli meat for his sandwich. 
He began rushing me and telling me ""This is why I pester you to get up. Did you even start on my lunch?""
I said ""I was trying find-"" but he cut me off. 
""I guess no lunch for me then."" He snapped while pouring himself coffee in a travel mug.
I shushed him, which I guess was the wrong thing to do.
He started ranting at me about how it's always so difficult to get me up. 
I snapped and said ""Well maybe you should be a man and pack your own lunch from now on! That's what *family member who has the same job* does!""
Husband snaps back ""Well, I'm not him and you're not *his wife*!""

I said ""Glad that's clear, either way, expect me not get up at all next week and pack your own lunch from now on.""

In the midst of all this, I had packed him a container of the salad and a fork. At least it was something. 
He stormed out as soon as I had zipped his lunchbox for him. 

I know a lot of this was said in frustration, but I admit I do envy the family members who are in the same positions as us. The wife and I are both stay at home moms with toddlers, yet she's not expected to always pack her husband's lunch. He just grabs whatever's in the fridge or preps it at night so he can grab and go the next morning. I tried doing that for my husband and he complained about it not being fresh. 
I should point out the family member is in his late 30s, so I guess it's a matter of maturity. 

But I feel the need of outsider's opinions. 
Am I the a-hole here?

Update: I posted an update in the comments, but I am sure it has been buried by now.
We talked it out. We agreed it would be a good idea that IF I was to keep packing his lunches, I will do it at night from now on. 
I actually like packing his lunches, it's the getting up that early in the morning that is my main issue. 
He DOES appreciate me, and said so. I know everyone here has a perfect man who has never made mistakes nor snapped at you when feeling rushed. But I am happy my man isn't perfect because he would be boring. I'm not perfect either and can list many mistakes I have made. I know I have posted things here before about my husband. And the responses to those posts have helped us discuss the problems. You are only seeing small blurbs of out life. Not all of it. Remember that when people post about an issue in their relationships. 
Thank you for the comments, either way.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not laughing at an unfunny joke?,"Using a throwaway, but, my boyfriend texted me earlier with what I assumed was the beginning of a joke. I answered and said what and he went on to say something like “(my name) is gonna s*** my d***k” and I looked at the message and didn’t respond. I actually felt disgusted honestly with the joke he made. It wasn’t funny to me either. Now, I can take a joke, because we do joke around sometimes but there’s been times he’s made a joke and I think what I’m actually doing dating him. When we met up he laughed in my face after I told him I clearly didn’t like said joke and he texted me before I went into work and asked “are you still mad😂” Now, the reason I thought I might be the a-hole is because i’m now ignoring him and I responded to his text after a couple hours? But he recently texted me saying “it happened hours ago, i’m over it” but i’m not actually over it? I really felt disrespected and it seems he doesn’t care.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling some family members to stop being sensitive? *TW?*,"So, I traveled roughly 250 mi to pick up my aunt for she was helping with a family emergency and ended up being 2ish hours late to the meeting place. There was awful weather and traffic and I got really annoyed when they kept calling me every 30 min to ask where I was at. We agreed to put me on this family tracking app so whenever I make this trip again(because it will definitely happen again), I can focus on the road and they can feel better knowing I'm not dead in a ditch or something.

Anyways, this tracking app is where the drama started. I put in my info, yada yada, and it allows you to pick any name you want to be displayed. Mine was IKilledMufasa (it was a pun/inside joke. i thought it would be funny) and got a call about an hour later telling me to change my username. I asked why and they said because it was offensive and they cared about that movie alot. I got a little miffed since it was hypocritical of them to be 'sensitive' when they also told me a while back to ""stop being sensitive about your PTSD."" (That was not a fun panic attack situation.) I brought up the hypocrisy but was just told ""this is different."" Sure, whatever.

Anyways, I changed my username to my actual name but changed my profile picture to a pride flag (previously it was Jeff from Billy and Mandy). This side of the family is very alt right and thinks anything lgbt related should not be allowed in public (same sex couples cant be allowed to hold hands, pride flags can't be posted outside, the usual bigotry) so I thought it would be a nice FU/malicious compliance to have pride as my profile photo. I guess if the bear is already ticked off, why not poke it some more?
I mean, they're the ones who wanted me on this app. I didn't care either way.

Anyways, as expected, I got a call about being offensive again and promoting ""perversion"". I told them to stop being overly sensitive about things where they replied, ""If you want us to take your issues seriously, take ours seriously."" I still haven't changed my photo.

WIBTA For telling my boss I'm not working on new year's?,"Ok I'm a high school student and I got my first real job over the summer.  I'm working for my mom's friends who owns her own business, I started as an intern and became a real employee after summer.  Since school started I can't work as much so once or twice a week I would go to her house and answer voicemails, input data and others stuff like I would do over summer and this was fine because my mom knew her and we lived close by.  But lately she has been giving me more work than usual and not paying me extra for it.  For example while I was inputting data I had to also watch her kids, which did not bother me much because there kind and pretty well behaved but then she had me do more like laundry, and making her kids dinner and again I'd be fine with it if I got payed more to do it but I'm not.  She is only paying me for the voicemails and data and expects me to do all of the other stuff for free! My mom also works for her as a cleaner and she did the same thing to her by only paying her for the cleaning but having her do extra and add her on for more and more  hours without asking her.  But today I was leaving her house and she gave me the December calendar with me and my mom's work schedule on it and when I looked it over in the car ride home with my dad I saw that she put me down as working at her house from 9pm December 31st to 1pm January 1st.  She wants me to stay over night at her house and take care of her kids so she can go out!  Firstly I'm not comfortable staying over at her house and she didn't even ask me if that was ok plus it's a holiday!  I usually watch the ball drop with my little sister but I'm expected to not do that and watch it with some other lady's kid, No I don't want to do that at all!  My dad says she is using me and my mom and we should just cut all ties with her because she thinks she can pay us for our normal job and not for the extra we have to do.  I don't know what to do in this situation, I don't want to work on new year's but I feel like it would be rude to just tell her no, I'm thinking about just finding an excuse to get out of it like being out of town or sick so I have a reason to tell her I can't.

AITA For Calling Out My Dead Ex's Lack of Involvement With Our Children,"AITA for calling out my dead ex's lack of involvement with  our children?   


I was looking at posts made as a tribute to my ex on his facebook and noticed one from his mother where she posts that he loved his kids very much despite not being ALLOWED to see them. Obviously this upset me and I took a screenshot of the post she made and posted it with a long wall of text going into detail that he's only asked to see his children once in 4 years and then never followed through with it and that he always had the ability to see his children, he just didn't care enough to do so.   


Now I'm getting messages from a relative of mine telling me I'm the a-hole and should remove my post because ""it doesn't look good to beat up on a dead guy who can't defend himself"" and that ""his mom is just hurting because she lost a son"" which I understand that she's hurting but it doesn't justify spreading lies that he wasn't allowed to be in his kids lives.

AITA for refusing to rent to my pregnant friend,"I (32F) grew up in a low income household and was determined from an early age to start investing and owning real estate.  I graduated from pharmacy school with minimal debt and bought my first rental property. I currently own 4 rental properties with my fiancé. We both learned how to remodel and fix basic things to keep costs low. We use the rental property money to invest in stocks and looking into buying a 5th property. 

My best friend (32F) of 15 years has been married to her husband for 3 years and they have 1 child and 1 on the way. Their landlord has decided to evict them. He has given them 60 days to find a new place. They have asked if they could live in one of my rental properties.

The problem is they are not very clean people and that is one of the main reasons for their eviction. My friend has 4 cats and they pee EVERYWHERE. On their clothes, sofa and beds. They also tend to scratch the walls and  cabinets. She just says it’s just because they’re a*holes. Their current home is on the brink of being on a hoarders episode. Her husband spends his free time playing video games and does not try to help in cleaning or doing any “woman” chores. 

My friend has also asked if we could give her a discount on the rent since they are about to have their 2nd baby.  Both of them work but my friend’s job  will not pay her the whole time she is on maternity leave. 

I told her I could give her a temporary reduction on the rent but she would not be allowed to have the cats. She said they are like her children and could not get rid of them. She said that would be like asking to get rid of her human children and I am the a*hole for even suggesting it. I told her those were my stipulations. I have been fortunate that my tenants with pets are respectful and clean up religiously after them. 

She currently is not talking to me and telling our other friends that it’s my fault she is about homeless. A couple of friends have said I should make an exception but  I’ve put so much time and money into these homes. So am I the asshole for telling my friend she can’t move in with her cats?",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to quit the soccer team,"I, 16F love all sports, but soccer is one of my favourite. Our school wasn't able to have any sports teams for the last couple years due to the pandemic and I was really excited to be able to play sports again.

I really wanted to make the soccer so I was practicing for a while. I asked my friends if they wanted to practice but they refused. They said that they were busy so I just practiced by myself.

Tryouts for soccer happened a little while ago and me and my 4 friends tried out. Yesterday, the team was posted. We all rushed to the list and I started looking for my name and when I found it I was supper happy. You could tell by looking at me that I was really happy.

After, I tried to talk to my friends but they just kind of walked away. I met up with them at lunch but they just looked upset. I asked them what was wrong and they said that they didn't make the team. I said that I was really sorry. They asked about me and I was really hesitant to tell them I made the team.

The second I said it, their faces changed from sad to angry. They told me that it wasn't fair that I made the team, they said that I had an unfair advantage as I had trained before tryouts. I was taken aback and this is where I might be the a-hole. I said that it was their fault for not wanting to train and do other things like party but that they can't blame me for making the team when they were just slacking.

All my friends started crying and one of them said that if I really was their friend, I would quit the team because it hurt them too much to see me on the team when they didn't make it. At this point, I was a bit mad. I told them I don't care and that their request was absurd. I said that I understood that they were upset but that there was always next year and that if they wanted to make the team next year they should start training now.

They all said that they would have been good enough if any of the people who made the team didn't train. I muttered under my breath obviously not but one of them heard and me and started calling me a jerk, an a-hole and a b\*\*ch.

They told their friends that I was being rude for hurting their feelings. A lot of my friends were telling me that I was an a-hole for what I did.

AITA for snapping at my mom for “teasing” me about one of my friendships?,"So a few days ago I (28F) snapped at my mom (57F) after she repeatedly teased me about my ""secret love affair"". About 2 weeks ago, my car stopped working and I can't afford to have the local mechanic fix it. I live in a small town, and I work at a restaurant about 15 miles away in another small town. There's no public transportation, so I've had to ask people for rides. One of the people who has given me the most rides is one of my regular customers, Ryan (64M). He's a sweet old man, and I've known him for awhile now. My mom found out that he's been giving me rides, and she has been constantly teasing me about it.

Normally, I could handle a little teasing, but the subject made me very unconfortable. I'm Aro-Ace, meaning I don't experience romantic or sexual attraction. The thought of being in any kind of intimate relationship makes me very uncomfortable - a fact that she knows because I've told her this multiple times. I also have pretty bad anxiety and am a somewhat paranoid person. She's made comments about other friendships before (like ""I know you're just friends but he's *obviously* into you) that made me so paranoid about them that I started overthinking every interaction to make sure it wasn't romantic at all. I even ended a 2-year friendship because I got so panicked about the possibility of them being interested in me that I couldn't handle it.

I've since gotten therapy and am much better about relationships and not allowing my paranoia to get the best of me. But because of that incident, I told my mom to stop making comments about my relationships and to stop talking about relationships to me in general. She agreed, but still slips up occasionally. Ever since she found out about Ryan, she's been making these comments about our ""relationship"" - how much he must like me to be willing to drive me home/to work, ""wow you guys must be *close* •wink-wink-nudge-nudge•"", etc. I told her it wasn't like that. The straw that broke the camel's back was when I told her - for the fifth time - that it wasn't like that since I'm aro-ace, and she replied ""so he's like your sugar daddy, but without the sugar"" and giggled like a middle schooler.

I snapped at her and told her to shut the F up about Ryan already, I told her a million times not to talk about that stuff with me. She stopped giggling, looked at me all hurt and just left. She hasn't spoken to me since (it's been 2 days). I feel like I might be, if not *the* A-hole then at least *an* A-hole for snapping at her. I know she doesn't mean anything malicious, she just loves love and wants me to be happy; she just can't understand being able to be truly happy without a relationship. She always said she was happiest when she and my dad were together, so I think she just wants that for me and can't understand that I don't need some Big Love Story to be happy.

AITAH for being upset my SIL cut my 11 month old son's hair for the 1st time and hanging up on her apology,"Hello There - Am I the a-hole for hanging up on my sister in laws  'apology'? 

My husband (35M) and I (34F) have 3 sons (3 years, 11months x 2 - twins). We recently had birthdays and treated each other to hotel stays without the children. My family watched our boys for the stay I planned for him and his family watched the boys for the stay he planned for me. 

My MIL's house is often praised for being a sanctuary and safe place and I had zero worries about the boys staying there with his mom (73F) and 2 sisters (approx late 30s early 40s Fs) I know they love the boys very much. (Neither auntie has kids or have been married)

The problem is, when we picked up the boys, our smallest twin boy had his bangs cut. (And not very well).  I asked if they cut his hair and all was silent. One of the aunties then proclaimed it was her fault - no one else's and it wasn't a cut, it was just a little trim. But totally on her. (No apology.) 

I had a feeling she may have cut his hair because she had sent a photo of them looking out a window earlier that morning and his hair looked off. My husband was irritated with me for mentioning it at first, but then said he would have my back and understood my fear. We both told ourselves surely, they wouldn't do such a thing. One of the 3 adults would have said no, don't cut the baby's hair.....right? 

My husband is super worried about being cut off from his family and causing a scene so I just responded with ""I guess he just got his first hair cut at Gs"" (and again got reminded, it was just a trim).

Not wanting to 'cause a scene' I took the boys and changed their diapers and got them ready to go home. 

When we got home and the hair spray they had styled the boys with wore off, I could truly see the damage done....and I cried. I cried because of how terrible it looked and I cried because we were wanting to let their hair grow out and that decision was taken from us. We also wanted to keep locks of the first haircut, but that was lost as well. 

I cried alone in our bathroom because I didn't want to upset my husband or the kids, but I was and still am genuinely hurt and feel so disrespected. 

The next morning, my husband and I ended up getting into a fight and I told him how disrespectful it was for his family to have cut our son's hair, without permission, and without apology. He swears his sister apologized and then proceeded to talk to me about how rude my family is so I have no room to talk.....

Then he angerly called his sister and shoved his phone at me saying I needed to tell her how I felt. So I did. I told her I cried when we got home and I was just really hurt that she cut his hair.  

She then proceeded to tell me she was sorry but it wasn't malicious and I could cut her firstborns hair if it was that big a deal and told me I could be sad, but my feelings are unproductive.....

I thanked her and hung up. 

Hubby grabbed his phone back and stormed out the door.

AITAH?

UPDATE

SIL just called to apologize again because I told my husband she would not be watching our kids unsupervised (without me or him - his sisters and mom don't count as supervision) unless I get a genuine apology. 

She proceeded to tell me she is genuinely sorry BUT she thinks I am overreacting and doesn't understand why I'm so upset. She said she wouldn't have done it if she knew I was going to get so emotional and make such a big deal about it and she is not responsible for my feelings and doesn't want me to use her mistake as an excuse to drive a wedge between our family.  

She said she will never understand how I feel but is sorry.

She doesn't know what else I want from her and that she's sorry if she took a mom moment away from me or something.....but again, she will take responsibility for the action of trimming his hair, but will not take responsibility for my feelings. 

I told her she had no domain in my feelings, my home, or my marriage and that I know my son's hair will grow back and he will have more haircuts. I'm not trying to drive a wedge and I still love her and my son and that maybe, when she actually has a kid of her own, she will be able to empathize with me more about what transpired. Until then, I accept the apology. 

WIBTA if I sent her a link to this post for saying I am over reacting..... 😂

JK - won't be doing that - I think I just need to be the bigger person and just let it go....🥺💔🥲

UPDATE

My husband has since come and apologized and reassured me he is on my side here. (He posted on this post himself as well) 

I want to make sure I voice that I love my husband very much (with all my heart and soul) and I also love my in-laws. 

If I was a bigger, wiser, person, I probably could have just laughed this whole situation off and in hindsight, I don't at all like that he or his family may feel like I've damaged relationships irreparably.

My husband has very valid feelings and fears about being 'cut out' of his family for displaying emotions that they don't approve of or agree with. And while I know they will always love him, I do know from experience, we will be uninvited or just not told about 'family' events because they don't want to deal with the 'confrontation' or 'drama'. 

This is why I tried my best to not 'make a scene' when I first noticed the haircut. 

Ultimately, I was forced to confront my SIL before I had fully even processed my own emotions and I know it will be on me to smooth things out so my in laws can feel better about what happened. 

Thank you to all you anonymous users out there who helped me feel validated in a time I was feeling so alone. 🌹",Not the A-hole
AITA for not being overly excited that my SIL is pregnant,"Sorry this is a long one but i need some opinions outside of my family. 

So I (23 f) and my husband (23 m) got married in November. We are both happy and live in the house we bought before we got married. We are not currently trying to have a baby but we aren’t necessarily opposed to getting pregnant. We have been talking about it for about a year and we both agree that we dont want wait a super long time to start trying. Last month i had felt off and had super bad morning sickness. So i decided to take a pregnancy test and it was positive. I was super excited and so was my husband. I made a dr. Appointment and when i got the bloodwork back, it was determined that i had a chemical pregnancy. I had gotten myself so worked up that i was heartbroken. We decided not to tell our families because my mother is the kind of person that thinks you should be married for at least a year before trying to have kids. So I really didnt want to get into it. 

A few weeks later, we had to go to the bank to get my moms name off my bank account (its been that way since i was 17) and put my husbands name on it. My mom offered to pick us up since she would be driving past our house to get to the bank. We agreed and didnt think anything of it. On the car ride there, my mom started talking about our finances. She said that we spend too much money and need to start budgeting. She says this pretty much every time we see her but this time she was getting onto my husband saying that he needs to do a better job at supporting me and suggesting that he get a second job. (Side note, he just had started a new job after being let go from a job where he made $26/hr for reasons that were not his fault.) I decided that i was not going to put up with this and it soon turned into a screaming match between me and my mom. Once it calmed down, she said “i know about you OBGYN appointment. I hope you aren’t pregnant “. I immediately burst into tears and said “i was but now im not”. He response was “good. It breaks my heart to think ove you having a baby right now. You are too immature and not financially stable enough.” The rest of the car ride was silent. 

Now, this past weekend, by brother (25 m) and his wife (24 f) who have been married for almost 3 years, announced their pregnancy and my mom was beyond excited. She was screaming, jumping up and down saying “my first grandbaby!”. I acted the best I could and hugged them both and congratulated them. I excused myself to the bathroom when everyone was talking. No one was paying attention to me so i didnt think anything of it. I collected myself and went back to join the party. Everyone was still excited and happy i I assumed everything was fine. The next day, my mom calls me and proceeded to say how rude i was and that i made everyone uncomfortable and therefore stealing their spotlight. I didnt even know what to say so i just said im sorry and hung up. I havent said anything to anyone since but my mom is still texting me demanding I apologize to my brother and SIL. So am i the A-hole?

Edit:: my husband was at the announcement. According to him, no one even turned around to see I wasn’t there. They were all talking to each other. My mom is the only one who noticed so theres that.",Not the A-hole
AITA for throwing out a cake I have ordered?,"My fiance just had birthday and my mom asked if she should bake him a  cake. I told her that it is not a good idea because he is extremly picky eater. She insisted on baking it. I gave her a specific instruction to make sure it would be something he would actually eat. I told her to make a lemon flavoured cake with no butter cream because he hates butter with passion and not to make it overly sweet. And i specifically said no fondant, because it is just overly sweet and disgusting. We also found a refrence picture.
 
Few weeks went by and it was time of the birthday party. My mom proudly gave him the cake and i was horrified when i saw it. It looked nothing like it should have. It was also coverd in fondant and had a thick layer of butter cream. My moms explenation was that she had to use butter cream because the other cream was melting the fondant she wanted to put on top. Also the cake was plain and not lemon flavoured, but the cream had a coffee flavour. Excellent choise for someone who hates coffee. When my fiance asked what it is made of she lied about the butter cream and told us to remove the fondant if we do not like it. We told her she should keep the cake and eat it since she did not listen to the given instructions and we would most likely not eat it. She insisted we take the cake. So we did. We tries the cake and neither of us did like it, so we ended up throwing it away. 

Now my whole family says I am an A-hole for ordering a cake and not wanting it anymore. The say we are ungrateful because my mom spent lot of time and effort making it and we did not apriciate it. So am i/are we the A-holes?

AITA for not explaining to my 6 year old brother why we have different dads?,"Hi there, I was wondering if I am the A-hole in this situation...

I (14m) was riding with my brother (6m) when he began asking questions about our family. When I was conceived my birth mother was 16, she couldn't take care of me. And my parents, who were close family friends  received news that she was looking for loving parents for me. Obviously they took me in, but I have remained in close contact with my mother, who we will call A.B.M for Awesome Birth Mother.

Anyway, fast forward 14 years and I am riding in the car with my ""half brother"" (I don't like putting titles on things like that) when the question came up. ""So... my mom is your mom?"" he said, I replied saying ""Of course, we are brothers through and through"" ""Well in that case... Is my dad your dad?"" Both me and my grandmother (who was driving) paused. Then she replied ""well that is complicated, we will talk about it when you are older"" C.B (I will call my little bro that from now on... cause it stands for Cool Brother) Looked at me and gave me a puzzled look, then asked again ""Is my dad your dad?"" I just looked at him and smiled, ""It's complicated L.B... Can we discuss this when you are older?"" L.B just looked at me with a disappointed look, then looked back at his Nintendo Switch.

Later I told some of my friends and they complained saying that I should have just told him, or warned A.B.M that he had asked some questions. But I really don't want to bring it up to A.B.M since my father is NOT a subject she likes to talk about. I should also mention that when we got home my Grandpa warned me that this is a touchy subject and under NO circumstances was I to bring it up to C.B again! He even said that if things escalated they might have to temporarily cut contact with me... But than again... he is kind of a hot-head.

I feel like I may have damaged our relationship by with-holding info from him. I also feel I made the right  decision. I feel if I had told him at this age he might not see our mom the same way... So I have to ask... Am I the A-hole?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not washing 100% of the dishes?,"This is a dumb little thing and no one's divorcing anyone, but I just wanted a sense check if I’m being a d\*ck, please!

My (34F) partner and I (32F) work slightly different hours and try to split chores evenly, so for dishes we clean up after our own meals/snacks, and aim for ‘one cooks, one cleans’ for our dinners together. We’re not super strict about it, but we try to not let something sit for more than a day or so (unless its sticky/gross).

But I like to clean up just after dinner, and she likes to leave it until just before bed, so I usually end up doing the dishes most nights (hers, mine, whatever’s there). I have no issue with this, since I like to make tea after dinner so I just wash up while it’s brewing.

The exception is that about 70% of the time I don’t wash her mocka pot. She uses it every day before her early shift, and leaves it in the sink to clean later. I don’t like scooping the soggy coffee grounds out and scrubbing the parts with the special brush. So I do 95% of the dishes, and all she has to do is her mocka pot before bed.

Every now and then she complains that I don’t clean the mocka pot too. But my rationale is that I’ve done most of our dishes otherwise, so that’s still good, right? I understand it would be a nice thing to do if I cleaned it for her, and I’ve done it more often since she’s mentioned it, but am I the a-hole if I don’t?

I didn't think so, but we just had a Halloween party and used just about every pot, pan and plate we own. I chipped away at at the mountain of dishes after work each day for three days – hand washing and stacking as much as would fit on two drying racks, putting it all away the next morning, then doing another pile that night, along with our regular daily dishes. I probably dirtied more than my fair share because I did some baking for the party, but it was a lot.

All that was left were a few oven trays that weren’t super dirty or high-use so they were left til last. I took a break for a night, and the next night she started washing them without being asked, which was lovely, but she complained that I left her the bulky/annoying ones. I told her it honestly wasn’t intentional, that I just hadn't gotten to them yet, but I think she was connecting it to the mocka pot ‘situation’ and implied I’d done it deliberately to be stubborn. She said ‘when I start washing dishes I wash everything’. But she knew I had been washing and putting away all those dishes for three days and didn’t step in to help, so I think my approach of ‘do as much as I can with the energy I have’ is pretty fair.

In her defense, she has a physical job (customer service) with an early start and a longer commute, so she’s tired at the end of the day. I have an office job, which is why I try to do more when I can.

So am I the a-hole?

&#x200B;

UPDATE:

Thanks for the reassurance everyone. Most people seem to think it's fine if I leave the moka pot sometimes. That being said, I don't disagree with people who said it would still be nice to do it, and I should give my partner a chance to actually do the dishes herself when it's her turn.   


So I'll do that going forward, washing the pot when it's my turn and not volunteering myself unnecessarily if I don't have the energy.

AITA For Expecting my BF to be my date to a wedding ?,"One of my friends is getting married tomorrow. Me (F22) and my boyfriend (M24) have been dating for a year and a few months now. We live together and all that. So we share a lot of moments in life together. 

When I got the wedding invitation towards the end of August, I immediately mentioned it to my bf under the impression that he would be my date because you know we are in a relationship. My friend even put his name on the invitation, knowing that we were together. 

Immediately I got backlash. From it being too far ahead to see if he had the free time, to him not knowing my friend/ having met my friend, to not having anything to wear, all the way to worrying about financial issues. With about 2 months to spare I immediately tried to quell these thoughts by putting some things into action. 

I mentioned to my friend that he hadn’t met my boyfriend yet. And he immediately started inviting both of us out to different events like his “wedding shower” (a at home gathering), drinks and cigars around his fire pit in his backyard, and even canoeing with him and his fiancé. 

My boyfriends responses to all of these all boiled down to him just saying no. Citing socially awkward situations, and not knowing anyone at these functions. 

Aside from my friend I know no one either. I haven’t even met his fiancé aside from Instagram. I brought this up to my boyfriend and it didn’t really matter to him. He felt as thought I wasn’t being considerate of him because I was even entertaining these plans  trying to make him more comfortable.

Fast forward to just now. Less than 24 hours before the wedding. I asked him if he just wasn’t going to go and he got super angry at me. To the point where he just walked out of the room. 

Mind you up until this point I’ve figured out all the details of him coming. Offered to pay for his clothes and anything else. Friday I mention this to him and he tells me to just leave him alone. 

Now he’s telling me that I am the a-hole because I shouldn’t have just assumed he was going to be my date. Does that make me the A-hole?",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I refused to hear out my step-dad after I moved out?,"I (15 female) and both my sisters, (19, and 12) have recently moved out of my mom's house due to our stepdad. My older sister left first after an argument when he told her her opinion does not matter. (Tension had been building up before this as well) So after that, she left. A few weeks later, I also got into an argument with him as well, and when I said ok I’m leaving, he told me good, leave. Not long after my little sister followed and my mom then filed for divorce from him. But now, a few weeks later, my mom has agreed to a 6-month separation where he is going to counseling and trying to get better, and they’re hopeful that we’ll forgive my stepdad and they won’t have to divorce.  (Keep in mind my mom was on our side a few weeks ago and now still wants to be with him, he’s also been very manipulative towards my mom in the past). Now my mom is trying to tell us to hear him out and that he’s changed (in 3 weeks) and he’s going to keep changing more and I’ve told her no. He has done too much at this point and there’s nothing he can do to fix it. (He’s done a LOT, too much to say here, but a bit is he’s called us all assholes and said we were ruining their marriage, threatening to burn our stuff, and more). My sisters agree with me and none of us think we could ever forgive him, so would I be the a-hole if I didn’t hear him out? Even if he’s “changed”.

Edit: just so I’m a little more clear, the six-month separation they’re doing, they’re basically following through as if they were divorcing, with both going to counseling, alone and separate, and seeing if they want to keep trying or not at the end of six months. He also has given me and my older sister an apology, AFTER he found out my mom was filing for divorce (which makes me think he is just trying to save their marriage) and for mine he was blaming everything on stress and work. Also, he has burned my step-brother's things before so his threats weren’t empty.

UPDATE- they gave the separation a try and surprise surprise, he couldn't keep up his act. After about a month and a half, he started being weird and mean to her again so she talked to the lawyer and they're moving forward with the divorce. Thanks for all the reassurance and kind words. <3",Not the A-hole
AITA For sending pink envelopes?,"I sell Pokémon cards on eBay as a side job. I have been doing it way before; the rush on Pokémon cards was a big thing. When I mail out my cards, I like to send them in different colored envelopes to stand out. The colors are red, blue, pink, green, and yellow. They are randomly picked and using different colors helps me remember who has what order. I have never gotten a complaint before and thought it was a great idea. So, when your letter arrives it’s a fun experience instead of just getting a PWE. ( Plain White Envelope)   


I had an order for a card that was randomly put in a pink envelope and mailed off to the buyer. About a week or so later I get a message on eBay from the buyer asking me not to send him pink envelopes because pink is for girls, and he doesn’t want his neighbors to see him carry in a pink letter. About a week goes by and I add more items to my eBay and this person bought more things from me. About ten different cards. I don’t remember him from all the other orders, so one of his packages gets sent in a pink envelope. I had a lot of orders that week and a lot of people got pink envelopes along with different colors. I’m also sure another one of his orders was sent in a blue one.  


He messages me again, furious that I have sent him another pink envelope. He informed me that he would not buy from me again if the next envelope was pink. His message also included “I don’t want another pink letter only sending me color associated with the American flag, so only red and blues. If it’s on the gay flag, I don’t want it.” Weird because the pride flag is a rainbow, but I digress. He sent other things that he felt were associated with pink that he didn’t want to be associated with, but I think we all get the point.  


So about two weeks later he orders about twenty cards, which is over the weight limit for eBay standard card shipping, so I broke his order down into separate orders. Cards were bought in different orders of five, so it was easy to do. I had a buy three get two free.   


I decided I didn’t want this person to go without his pink envelopes any longer, so I sent him five separate pink letters for his cards. Now, where I think I was being the A-hole was while talking to my girlfriend, she defended him, saying “he could have been in the closet, and you exposed him to his family.” I tried to show her the messages where I don’t think that is the case. So she changed it to "" He doesn't want to be made fun of by his neighbors and now he will."" But now I feel bad that he did ask to not get them sent anymore, but I decided to be petty.

AITA for asking my roommate’s friend not to clean my kitchen?,"I (22f) live with 2 guys, let’s call them Nick and Schmidt (yes New Girl reference). 

Recently Schmidt went out of town and his and Nick’s high school friend Megan who went through a break up asked Schmidt if she could crash in his room as he is not gonna be staying there for a while. Schmidt asked Nick and I if Megan could be our guest till she finds her own place as she used to live with her bf. I felt bad and said sure she can. 

Nick was a little uncomfortable with the idea as Megan is known to gossip a lot and Nick doesn’t want his personal life to be a part of her gossips. But I convinced him and she moved in with us, as a guest, 2 weeks ago. 

Ever since she moved in she’s been weirdly obsessed with cleaning the kitchen. At first I didn’t mind, then she started rearranging the kitchen. So the guys don’t use the kitchen much and most of the kitchen is filled with my stuff. It’s a little messy but I categorize different things and arranged it. She started moving everything in my shelves around, like putting pot lids with coffee mugs, coffee powder with ramen packets , spices with pans etc. I told her politely, three times, not to touch my stuff as I am very particular about where things go. 

Now here’s where I might be the a-hole, today when I told her not clean the kitchen for the 4th time, and went inside my room, she sneaked back out of her room and started rearranging again, when I came out to get some water I saw her moving my stuff and I got mad and told her that she’s a guest and she should behave like one and not go around moving stuff in my kitchen. 

She called and complained to Schmidt who called me an a-hole for not understanding what she’s going through and I shouldn’t have talked to her like that. Nick is on my side and he said Megan has always had boundary issues and she never understands where to stop and I am in the right to call her out on her behavior, but Schmidt and Megan are really mad at me.

AITA for giving my little sister a nickname my stepmom doesn’t like?,"I know the tile seems stupid and I hope you agree but my stepmom is very mad.
I (15f) have a little sister McKenley (5) whose parents are my dad and my stepmom Ashlee. When picking McKenley’s name Ashlee threw out names like Brinkleigh, Addisyn, and Ainslee but McKenley was the only one they could agree out. I tried to get Ashlee to like my name ideas that matched my name, Wren.
But Ashlee once said, “ I wish your name was Wrenlee and not just Wren so  people knew you were a girl” I found that weird because Wren is commonly used as a girls name. My mom did not like that Ashlee said that about my name  and it confirmed for me that she would not like my ideas. When McKenley was born she made sure nobody called her anything but her name and we did. But overtime I created the nickname Kenzi for her because not only did you go with her name I thought it was really cute and it matched her. I try to keep it a secret for so long as possible because I knew Ashlee would be made but one day, Ashley, McKenley ,and I were sitting in the living room, when two year old McKenley started to run around  and I said “ Kenzi come back!” Ashlee looked at me and said “ Why did you call her Kenzi?” I said that “ Don’t worry I always call her McKenley I just mixed up names!” Ashlee brushed it off her shoulder. For context McKenley likes when I call her Kenzi because when I first started calling her that she said that it  easier to pronounce but now it has just stuck. When my dad caught on that I was calling her Kenzi her started calling her that too. But, he told my stepmom and because I was at my moms she sent me an angry text saying, “ Why would you call McKenley, Kenzi? If I wanted to my call her Kenzi I would have named her McKenzie but I didn’t so don’t call her that!” I wasn’t sure what to say and I thought it was stupid because it was just a nickname. I thought it couldn’t get worse but this august when Kenzi started kindergarten she came home with some art that she made that said “ Kenzi’s first day of school!” Ashlee was mad at both Kenzi and I for Kenzi telling her teacher that she wants to be called Kenzi and me for being an a-hole and giving her the idea of being called Kenzi. Ashlee is normally very nice so I’m not sure why she is so made about this. My dad is on my side saying that is also just a nickname but Ashlee still says that I am the a-hole. So I want to know, am I the a-hole?

WIBTA for scheduling family therapy without asking my dad?,"I (17 NB) am in a tough family situation. My parents are very homophobic and transphobic. My dad is also emotionally and psychologically abusive.

As an example, the other day, he and my mom got into a fight (I’m not sure what about). Later, me and my mom went out shopping, and my dad flipped out. We had extra bags for personal reasons, and he proceeded to scream, cry, and take our stuff (most of which was paid for by my mom). 

My dads behavior has caused both me and my mom depression, and possible C-PTSD for me. It has also affected my brother(M 13). He has been acting exactly like my dad, as an example, blaming my mom for his bad behavior because she “made him mad”.

However, I've had a few things happen recently; my father has been very ill, and my parents have needed my help lately. My friend has been very patient and understanding with my general absence the past few weeks. Plus, I had to miss a couple of days of work last week due to me being sick. I explained to my friend that due to her graduation ceremony overlapping with when I'm at work and me not in a position to ask for more time off/leave early, I'm not sure I'll be able to make it (she was not working at the time of my graduation). However, I told her I'd love to take her out for a celebration dinner the next weekend, where I'll also give her her graduation gift from me. She said she understood, but has been snippy and distant with me ever since. I feel like a terrible friend. I know she wants me to come, and I'd love to be able to be there, especially since she was there for mine.

WIBTA if I chose to skip Xmas with my family and spend it with my partner instead ?,"Hi guys ! First post on this sub and first post on Reddit, + English is not my native language so I apologise in advance for any language-related and /or formatting mistake. 

Here's the situation : I (25, F) have been living with my partner (24, M) for a year and a half. We've been together for almost two years. Our relationship is very serious (full disclosure : we're thinking about buying a house together). 

I come from a very religious background (catholic family with a lot of religious traditions), so Xmas celebrations have a special place in my heart, despite having drastically distanced myself from catholicism several years ago. Needless to say, my family, especially my parents, are NOT thrilled that I live with my partner without us being married. I do not wish to marry at all and this is being an issue because my parents and aunts / uncles are (not so) subtly pressuring me to take some actions in that regard, otherwise my partner might get excluded from Xmas celebrations this year. 

Onto the issue itself : I do not intend to spend Xmas without my partner if he's excluded, or even with him and my whole family if that means being belittled and berated for our lifestyle. I do understand that old habits die hard, but their biggotry is not something I intend to comply with just to make them more confortable. And at the same time, I know that me not spending Xmas with them would create a huge drama because this is such an important time to spend together in my family.

WIBTA if I didn't tell my husband it's my B-day tomorrow?,"Some background: Tomorrow I'll turn 32. My husband turned 27 one month ago. He was ill, so we had to cancel the BBQ we had planned, but I did everything I could to make it as special as possible.

Then we had his sisters wedding and a very active vacation abroad. We came back a few days ago. I had to go back to work immediately, but he has been off until tomorrow. It was a very hectic month to be sure.

So of course we talked about my B-day coming up a few times last month and I mentioned it a few times this past week. Even yesterday. So when I asked him today what he was gonna do tomorrow and he replied ""Just work"" I was a bit sad. Usually I plan all the events and he tags along, except for vacations since he speaks the local language. So, yeah, I forgot to plan my own party and tell him to take the day of. That one is on me.

But I am seriously convinced he forgot too. He did get me a gift from the store I work at, weeks ago, but I forgot if he stayed long enough to watch me wrap it, so maybe he doesn't even know the wrapped thing is the gift he got me. I placed it on the arm of the couch, in the middle of the room, so it might catch his eye anyway.

Usually I don't play games like this, but this time I don't want to pre-chew everything for him. We've been together for 5 years. It's about time he remembers my birthday. Becha his phone will give him a reminder and he will call me during his lunch break or a friend will beat him to it in a group app and remind him that way. But I'm feeling a bit sad nonetheless.

So Reddit, am I the A-hole for not telling him one more time?

UPDATE 1: First I would like to thank everyone who made the effort to react to my conundrum. Thank you all! I appreciate both the NTA and YTA comments. It still left me a bit confused though. And I would like to clear some things up.

1. Most of our communication is great. We have a very open and honest way of telling each other what's on our minds. Almost always...

2. This is the best relationship I have ever been in and my hubby is the greatest person in my life. Our relationship is not 100% perfect, but it is a healthy and happy one.

3. My B-day party will happen sometime this month, we just have to plan it with our friends to see which date is best. Did not have time for is yet. Hectic month and all that! :)

4. I forgot if there was a fourth point! Lol. Now on to the update. :)

Yesterday hubby started to feel a bit under the weather, got a sore throat and said if he can't sleep in the bed, he will sleep on the couch. We both do this sometimes cuz it gets super hot in our bedroom and bed so close to another human being. So when I woke up he was not there, but his dirty pants was. XD I did some laundry and waited to hear movement in the living room. In the mean time I read all your comment, while hanging out in the bed.

An hour later he stumbles to the toilet, which I can see from the bed. He does not greet me or acknowledged me, even though I tried to make eye contact. So I think to myself ""Here we go! First time he will actually forget my B-day"". He waddles to the kitchen all groggy eyed and I hear him make some breakfast and what not.

Okay, Reddit. I was a fool! And a total A-hole!

He comes back to the bedroom with a tray of healthy, asorti foods. There's toasted baguette with hummus, grapes, fancy cheese, radishes, cucumber and smocked and sliced sausage. Reddit, we only eat meat on special occasions! I'm crying! :')

He puts it down, puts his head on my lap and we cuddle. He's so sweet! <3 His troat still hurts, but he whispers kind words to me. I tease him that he only gets sick on birthdays. :)

A bit later he tries to find the gift I left on the couch, but apparently he moved it last night before sleeping there. I find it and hand it to him, he tries to hand it right back. I give him a sly look and hop back to the bed. He follows and gives it ceremonially to me and I have the hardest time opening up the wrapping. I feel sorry for my regular customers. That was supposed to be clarification number 4. I wrap all gifts that I sell in the store, so it was only natural for me to wrap this one too. I am better at it than he and I made it extra fancy!

Anyway, I have a super cute and elegant new watch on my wrist as I write this! He put it on for me, all the while cracking jokes. ""I hope the store clerc made it the right size for you"", "" If you don't like it, I can bring it back"" and ""I probably shouldn't say this, but I got it with [employee] discount"". Lol I love this man so much!

Later, as I was writing this, he came into the bedroom holding the tea he made himself and shows me the Pickwick label. It always has conversation starter questions on it and it read ""Who would you like to spend your birthday with?"". Reddit, I can not make that sh*t up! Lol was laughing so hard!

Today started out great! Hubby is staying to work from home, I will get him some throat pastilles and later I will meet up with my mom for lunch and some shopping.

 I realised I made myself worry for nothing. Yes, sometimes I'm a fool. Thank you all for the support and the kick in the but! Have a great day!

UPDATE 2: I just told my husband I had been a bit silly and showed him this post. As he read it he kept snorting and laughing. He said he did forget for a bit, but he had an alarm early in the morning to remind him. He told me he forgets everyone's birthdays and that at some point he will forget mine. I told him it is acceptable to forget it when I turn 89 and we are both senile. And that next year we would plan ahead and have a one day city trip to a town we haven't visited before. In the Netherlands it is super easy to travel, as loads of towns are somewhat interconnected by trains. 

We talked why birthday's are so important to me and I told him it is that one day a year where you explicitly express that you are grateful to have that one person/lover/friend/family member in your life. That you are happy that they exist and you want to spend time with them. I always tell people I love and appreciate them. I have no problem carrying my heart on my sleeve, but most people are not like that. They do not randomly tell you how much you mean to them. And I had some not successful birthdays as a child, where my dad would show up for example, so who knows what's at play there in my subconscious.

The fact remains that it is important to me and my husband understands that even better now, I think. Next year we will plant it together and way on time. Thanks for listening to my Ted Talk! ;)",Not the A-hole
AITA for being honest with my mum about not liking her new Bf?,"This is a throw away account and I will be using fake names. I’ll start this off by saying that I (15 nb) am autistic so I’m not good with tone reading and social signs, hence why I feel the need to ask. So my mum (41 F) recently got a new boyfriend (38 M) who I’ll call Simon. 

Simon now comes around to our house quite a lot and is quite rude/cheeky whilst he is there. Not to mention my mother completely ignores me whilst he’s there and I’m told to stay in my room even if I just want to get a drink. Simon will say things like calling me an idiot for not knowing something or saying that if he was my dad (which he isn’t) then I wouldn’t act like this, no idea what he thinks I’m acting like. I have said on multiple occasions to my mum and Simon that I don’t appreciate the way he speaks to me but every time my mum says he’s only messing around, even if he is he still takes it too far and I don’t like it. He speaks about my father in front of me, I don’t have much of a relationship with my dad due to him being unreliable but he’s still my dad and I don’t want some guy I met less than 6 weeks ago talking about him like that in front of me. Again something I have said but was ultimately ignored. Understandable why I don’t exactly like him, right? 

Well I brought all of this up with my mum and she just started arguing with me about it, again saying he’s only messing around and then brought up how apparently he respects me just because he uses my preferred name (something I’ve explained to her is the bare minimum). So then she basically said I was being selfish and an a-hole for all of this and told me to deal with it myself. So, am I the a-hole for being honest with my mum about not liking her new boyfriend after already telling her I don’t appreciate the way he speaks to/treats me?",Not the A-hole
AITA for wearing “revealing” clothes around my house in front of my dad and brother?,"I (17 f) recently got in a fight with my mom because I was wearing a sports bra and a sweater with holes in it downstairs while my dad was home. She said he called her and was mad at her and me for wearing that in front of him. 
This isn’t the first time my parents have gotten mad at me for this. Sometimes it is very hot in my house, and I wear tank tops (although those with high necks that just show my arms, nothing else). When I go out of my room with a tank top on, my dad usually starts screaming at me because he says he “doesn’t want to see his daughter dressed like that” and it’s “uncomfortable for him”. Personally I find this very gross and plain dumb. I’ve argued with him that it’s my house too and I should be able to dress comfortably, because I hate wearing long shirts and pants around the house all the time when it’s 100 degrees outside. 

For context, I come from a religious family, and I myself am religious, but I really can’t see the problem in me wearing the occasional tank top or shorts in the comfort of my home. Also for the most part I gave a really good relationship with my parents but this is the one thing that really really bothers me. It sucks seeing my friends being able to wear fat worse things while I can’t in the safety of my home. Am i the A-hole for wearing them even though my mom screams at me and says I have a dad and brother at home?",Not the A-hole
AITA for kicking my sister out my house knowing she had no where else to go.,"My sister (25F) has been living under my roof for 7 months now without paying rent buying food and doing no chores. She basically lived free not only that but she is super lazy I (30F) always have to clean behind her. It’s like I’m cleaning behind a pig. 
It got so worse that on her cycle she would leave her used pad on the counter and leave me to throw it away. That is where I crossed the line I told her she could not use my bathroom and had to use the downstairs bathroom which is super small and very unused. 
I guess y’all wonder “how she even moved in” well my sister never had anything going for her she dropped out of high school and went straight to working but that attitude she has she never keep her job for long. Almost a year ago she decided she just didn’t wanna work my parents wouldn’t let a bum live in they home and me being me I told her she could stay with me til she finally decides to get a job and get back on her feet. Well that was 7 months ago and I don’t even think she been looking for a job. Or to ever get her own place. Recently she invited her boyfriend over to stay I said it was fine as long as he stay away from my room my bathroom and my closet she agreed. Well I have a lot of valuable things in my closet hince  why I did not want him to go in there well those valuable things were missing and her boyfriend and my sister has been walking around with new shoes new clothes everything new. Yesterday I got off work early and caught my sister and her boyfriend stealing from me I was furious. I opened my own home up to both of them from the kindness of my heart and they stole from me I immediately kicked them out changed my door locks and I kept all the stuff they bought with MY money. My mom said I was a A-hole for kicking my own sister out. So Reddit am I the A-hole



Edit: it’s been 2 days I made a police report for theft but since I don’t have cameras and I don’t have official proof of my belongings being stolen the police said they can’t do nothing my sister is still not at my home and I haven’t heard from her since. My mom is still mad at me because I did not have my sister back as I have her back since she was a baby. As I had her back even tho she used me manipulated me and took my kindness for granted over the years. And I also have been getting comments over the story I made over a day or two ago as I said before that story is fake my sister did introduced me to this app and she told me to make a story for fun I did and it was fun at first as I didn’t see a problem in it I deleted the story once I made this one so there wouldn’t be any confusion. This story is real the last one is fake. Please stop calling me fake or  anything as The last story was all for fun.",Not the A-hole
AITA for calling my parents out on breaking their promise to not steal our baby name?,"So the context: months ago my mother (50 YOF, pregnant)and wife (26 YOF) were talking about baby names and asking not to pick certain ones because my wife didn’t think she’d have to bring this up because my mother has been infertile for like 8 years. So my mother asked for the names we were thinking and that they wouldn’t use them. A particular boy name was on that list. Fast forward to today and the baby is born and that same name is brought up. My wife (I was away from my phone at the time) calls them out saying they promised they wouldn’t take that name. Apparently my mom either forgot and/or never told my dad about this promise. So after an hour they come back saying he wasn’t aware of this promise, sorry, and names the kid the name anyways. My dad says my wife should’ve been a big girl and called him about it but she already said in our group chat three times prior to the decision that my mom promised her. Who’s the a-hole here? Thank you. PS I know my mom is 50! Please avoid comments on her age etc and stick to the relevant question:)",Not the A-hole
WIBTA If I Don't Move In With My Grandmother?,"I’m an (18F) and a couple of weeks ago, my mom had a hunch that her mother (my grandma) might be in some trouble and after paying her a visit, she’s been constantly talking about the possibility of having to move in with her. (For some background, my grandmother lives with grandpa, who is disabled and when he eventually passes, my grandma won’t be able to afford her house.)

&#x200B;

I feel awful that she’s in this predicament, and I can see why my mom wants to help her. I mean, if my mom were struggling, I would want to help her too. Here’s where I might be the A-hole. We moved in with my grandmother once before a couple years ago, and to say it was hell was an understatement. My grandmother and I were constantly arguing, and she would give chores that I had no idea how to do and would scream at me for not being able to do them. (Nothing physical, just verbal)

&#x200B;

And whenever I was being a normal kid, she would stir up trouble by making up lies and go to my parents in an attempt to take away my stuff so I could be her errand girl. (Thank God they didn’t believe her.) It got so bad to the point where I threatened to pack up and leave. But after some thinking, I stayed only for my mom, dad, and grandpa, and we eventually moved away from her. We might have a somewhat stable relationship now, but every time I think about moving in with her, I get flashbacks to how she treated me.

&#x200B;

I talked to my father, and he told me since I’m now an adult I can make the decision to leave, but he said it would be wise to stay with the family since I wouldn’t have anywhere else to go. (He doesn’t know this, but I’m making arrangements to move in with my boyfriend after graduation. And so far, almost everything is set.) I know this sounds like a huge decision and I love my grandma, but I cannot move back in with her again and worry about our relationship going back to the way it was.

AITA for shutting down someone who was loudly yelling at another person by swearing at them?,"About a week ago, I was at the store, minding my own business. Out of nowhere I heard yelling that I couldn't really understand, but it had me curious as to what was going on. As I was getting closer, wondering what was happening, I heard screaming by the registers, that was fairly loud. No one looked hurt but I figured there must have been a reason for the yelling.

When I got to where the screaming was, and could see what was going on, I saw a woman who was using all these obscenities at another woman, calling her the ""B"" word and saying she was fat and ugly, despite the woman who was yelling being much larger than her. I'm not one to stand by and watch someone get yelled at, and it was clear that the woman being yelled at just wanted to get out of there but was having a hard time concentrating because she was close to having a mental breakdown.

Having heard enough, and knowing I could talk far louder than this person if I wanted to, I came up behind her and blatantly told her she needed to ""shut the ""F"" up"" or I'd call the cops and they'd do it for her."" The yelling woman was about to respond but I told her that she'd better not dare open her mouth and to listen for once in her life. I said regardless of whatever was happening she was about to cause someone else to have a mental breakdown inside a store where people could potentially hear her all the way across the other side of it, just because she might have been cut off in line, which was something she kept saying between everything else.

I gave her a stern look and said, ""how would you feel if someone you didn't know yelled at you until you had an ""f-ing"" panic attack, and asked how would she respond if someone was doing that to her."" She gave me an angry glare like she wanted to start talking to me the same way she had the woman before, and I could tell she was about to start yelling at me, but I gave her an even more stern look, and told her to really think about it. She looked at me, and could tell as I was pulling out my phone what I meant by that, paused, and simply walked away.

The woman she had been harassing, managed to finish her groceries and simply just nodded at me as thanks, I did the same, and everything was fine after that. The yelling woman wouldn't even look at me or the the other woman the rest of time any of the of three of us were in the store. 

So, was I the A-hole for swearing at someone I didn't know?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not inviting my fiancée's brother to be one of my groomsmen?,"I’m getting married and the wedding is being planned by me, fiancée and her sister. At this point we have already chosen our BMs and GM. One day her sister asked ""why is my brother not one of the GM?""
I answered ""I don’t believe he deserves it"". My fiancée told me she 'would' want him to be. Her and her sister both kept lowkey trying to convince me but always finished with ""but it’s your choice"". I told them that I've decided that he will not be one of my GM and they both sighed in frustration but respected my decision.

Later, I told fiancée that all my current GM are people I consider close friends - I'm not close with him. I explained that as a person who grew up without a silver spoon and struggled to get to where I am today, that I hate her brother: A 25-year-old human parasite who gets everything he wants without effort and takes them all for granted. I don’t want to add him being one of my GM to his life full of givens.

He has never expressed interest in the wedding other than making expensive suggestions that I challenge by asking ""are you the one paying for this wedding?"" which he dismissively answers ""you’ll figure it out/mom and dad will pay for it.""

He lives and breathes with the mindset that their family is well-off and that he does not need university education, to get a job, or strive for success for the rest of his life (note: they are NOT well-off, both parents work 6 days a week).

Their parents give him EVERYTHING because he’s their 'precious little boy who can do no wrong' (i.e. in response to my fiancée’s mental breakdown due to sleepless nights for weeks caused by his rampant howling every night whilst gaming, their parents not only decided to gaslight my fiancée for having said mental breakdown, but also proceeded to buy him a pro-gamer level gaming rig with the finest and most expensive gaming table, chair, noise-cancelling headphones, and probably even a seat-warmer to keep his defunct testicles warm and comfy in his hardcore gaming sessions.

In addition, this event caused my deeply traditional fiancée to move in with me which devastated her because her parents condemned this decision (it's considered taboo in our culture for couples to together before marriage).

TL:DR, I’m against every fiber of his being and my principles would make a hypocrite out of myself were I to make him a GM, so I’m standing my ground – he will never be one of my GM unless he does something to deserve it.

I am completely aware that I have an air of self-righteousness in my thought-process. But who am I without my principles? I care too much about my principles and I’m very comfortable burning bridges with people if I deem it necessary – family, in-laws, or not. But with this one I feel quite conflicted as I know my fiancée is upset about it. It’s not just MY wedding after all.

To an extent, her sister and, I assume my future ILs, also expect him to be a GM.

AITA for not inviting my mom to a hoco party?,"My (F17) mom (F52) and I recently got into an arguement about a Homecoming party. This party was supposed to consist of 8 people, which were my friends, and we were going head to a fun arcade spot with bowling and mini golf. We decided to do this because my friends school ran out of homecoming tickets. My mom seemed suppotive in letting me go because she had given me the idea. I told her more information about it and she asked ""can i go?"" Which i responded, ""sure if you want to."" I said that in a panic because I cant say no to my mom (shes scary). Then thought it would be a good idea to ask the group how they felt about her going. I didnt think it was a good idea because itll be awkward and she wasnt invited. My friends thought the same thing. So i decided to tell her what they thought. This is how the interaction went.

Me: ""Hey uh. My frends thought it would be weird if you went and this is more of a friend homecoming get together. I hope thats ok.""

Mom: *scoff* ""Are you kidding me? Thats not nice.""

Me: ""..well it is just a friend thing..you know how it is when parents go its a little awkward.""

Mom: ""I wasnt asking permission to go. It was a retorical question. I dont care if they dont want me to go im going. They're being selfish.""

Me:""..oh""
 
Mom: ""Children arent supposed to ask if an adult can come. They should be alowwed to go anyway. Thats not your authority.""

Me: ""My intention was not to be selfish I just thought it would be respectable to ask if you can go cause its rude to just invite people.""

Mom: ""No! Youre being rude and selfish. I cant belive you would follow your friends decision. Ive been letting you do ""fun things"". You know, everytime I let you do stuff you always come back acting like youre ""of the world!""

My mom is..really conservative and Christian. ""Of the world"" means I am too attached to the world and that I am being sinful. Even though they dont think like me I still love them. It really hurt me when she said that because Ive been trying to get better.

Me: ""Well..i didnt know you werent asking permission. Im sure theyre ok with you going""(they arent)

Mom: ""No youre not supposed to ASSUME what i was trying to do. THATS OFFENSIVE. What i was going to do is go and see what its all about. I wasnt going to stalk you guys the whole time. I was also going to invite your brother and some of his friends to go. If youre being selfish then i dont think you deserve to go!""

Me:""..ok thats fine.""

Thats just a summery of what was said. I am thinking of moving out soon because theres a lot more of this that happens. Its not just this but sometimes it gets really bad. Im so tired of her and in some way shes hurting my faith. I feel like I might be the a-hole because she is an adult and a bunch of teenagers at an arcade by themselves seems bad. Not that we would do anything but I dont know. Maybe she doesnt think that. I dont want her to go but now im not going at all.

WIBTA if I left my Great Grandmother to live on her own because she doesn't like my friend?,"I (26f) and my friend (20m) moved into the 2 spare bedrooms of my great grandmother's (88f) house. He just didn't want to live with his crazy family, I was coming back from university, and Gram was all alone and we were worried about her health.

From the first week of us here, Gram started complaining about chores not getting done.  We agreed that we would clean our rooms individually, he would clean our bathroom, as well as our cat's litter boxes, and I would feed and water the cats, and clean the kitchen since I know Gram is picky about how the kitchen is cleaned. 

She claims that his room is always a mess (he doesn't make his bed, big deal), and that ""he doesn't clean."" I point out that he keeps our bathroom clean as agreed, and he'll even help me with dishes through out the day, but I guess she operates on ""I don't see it so therefore he doesn't,"" and always tells me that he's being unfair to me since 'I clean more than he does.' We've made a chore list, daily and weekly, that has a break down of everything she wants us to take care of, and we've written our names next to the ones we claimed and hung it on the fridge for her to see that it's split pretty evenly, but still, ""He's lazy and doesn't do enough, he's taking advantage of you, OP.""

She also complains that he plays video games all day, I point out that I do too, but she doesn't care that I do, yet it's not ok that he does. I think that's because I stay in my room where as his room doesn't get a wifi signal so his game system is set up in the living room (She won't let him hang out in my room btw, ""it's not proper for a man and woman to be in the same bedroom unless they're married""). 

He recently got moved to full time work, but it's on the night shift, so he leaves at 9:30pm and doesn't get home until 6:30am and will sleep till around 2pm as a result. She's now saying he's lazy because 'he sleeps all day.' Whenever I point out that he's on night shift and has to sleep during the day she insists that it's possible for him to still be up during the day to 'do more around the house,' (see previous issues she has with chores).

We're really considering finding our own place and leaving her to live on her own. She's my Gram and I would still talk to her every day over the phone so if she needs help with something I can come over, but we're getting really tired of the double standards. I'm just worried my family will see me as the A-hole here.

AITA for wanting my mom and stepdad to divorce?,"Hello Aita Sub-Reddit I’m here and I(19/20F) need your verdict; I originally posted on the off my chest sub/Reddit but, I really need an opinion to see if I’m wrong to feel this way.

To give some context to the situation my mom(45f) and stepdad(46m) met when I(19f) was about three or four years old, when I was five years old my mom decided to move to his home state/city. From then my mom has lived there and they’ve been together pretty much ever since.

During this time I have been back-and-forth between my bio dad and my mom’s through out the years until my 2nd year of high school to where I’ve now stayed with my dad(47m).

Now mom is staying with stepdad and his mother for bit before they moved out to an apartment later. This is where his mother (issue #1) comes in, she wasn’t a good person AT ALL! She lied, she stole, she was abusive, she loved attention good or bad, spreading rumors about others and instigates for no reason. My stepdad on the other hand is a mama‘s boy(issue #2). He would take care of her wants and needs even though she already has a fiancé that did that for her too. As this went on throughout their relationship and marriage he would neglect things at home including my mother, especially when it came to her abuse and words. Mom has been dealing with this for 15 years on top of raising 3 girls pretty much alone since he only caters instead of parenting them and doesn’t help at home regardless of if he has work or not(issue #3). At this point it’s reached an extent that it’s been taking a toll on her health and wellness!

It’s gotten so bad that one Saturday night I got a call from my mothers phone but, it wasn’t my mother. It was Auntie R telling me that she was in the hospital for a blood pressure over 200 and my stepdad no where to be found. I had to literally ask my bio dad to call him because I was livid! He tried to talk to me to call me down but, I just said “it’s OK” because I knew my words would’ve been so disrespectful.

Me, my mother, my godmother and Auntie R were p!$$ed. After getting off the phone with them, my father then comes to tell me that my stepfather said he wasn’t needed at the hospital.  But my thoughts were if his wife almost had a stroke so why wouldn’t he need to be there at the hospital?

I’m still currently infuriated with this man. He made a vowed to my mother “In sickness and in health and for better or worse.“ Now I can’t trust him with my mother and as things continue; I’m growing resentful and hateful towards this man….  I am angry, I am tired, I am hatful and I am done with tolerating my mother being placed a second fiddle!

So Reddit am I the a-hole for feeling this way?

WIBTA for banning my ex husband from our daughter's wedding?,"I divorced my ex 20 years ago.

WIBTA for not going to my dad’s wedding/step-grandparents ash spreading ?,"People involved:
Me (he/they, 20), My fiancé (they/she, 19) who also has mobility and health issues, my Dad, and my dad’s fiancé.

Background info: My fiancé and I have had a long distance relationship for years and I recently moved across the country to live with them. I have been living there for the past few months. My dad is divorced from my mom and is planing to marry his fiancé of 3 years. I do not like my dads fiancé, she is the definition of uptight and contradictory. She would punish my younger brothers when she decided they weren’t doing chores fast enough, but she would never do anything against her own daughter. She would ground my brothers (16 and 14) when they brought a snack to their rooms, but her daughter has a mini fridge in her room. I haven’t really had a strong connection with my dad since the divorce, but that’s part of a different story.

The Situation:
They are planning to get married in Hawaii, as well as spread ashes of her departed parents. The only people going to the wedding are my dad’s fiancés family, nobody from my dad’s side besides him, my brothers, and potentially me. It was originally planned that I’d be able to bring my fiancé with, but they changed their mind and said that it was never a conversation, it was never talked about and I brought it up on a whim. They said that if she paid her way, then she could come. Then, after finding out that we would be willing to pay for her, changed their minds again to say that it doesn’t matter if she was paying or not, they don’t want her coming. Saying that this is a “unique situation” but if it was any other scenario, they would welcome her with open arms. 
I told them that I didn’t think I could mentally handle the wedding and the ashes if my fiancé wasn’t there with me. They then proceeded to tell me that I would have family there and that this was a “family decision”. 
My fiancé is hurt and feels singled out by the quickness of the decision, the lying, and the backtracking. And I am pretty upset on her behalf.

I know it will probably hurt my dad if I’m not there for the wedding, but I don’t know if I can handle spending 9 days with my ‘stepmoms’ family (they have said some really shitty things to me in the past, including calling me disgusting for having to call pest control to my old apartment). I wouldn’t be able to handle them spreading the ashes of a man who was a father figure to me. And I’m not sure if my fiancé and I can financially handle having me take 9 days off of work with no pay.

So, would I be the a-hole for saying no to the invitation?",Not the A-hole
WIBTA for following directions?,"So I’m a teacher who due to no fault of my own was asked to leave my position. Yes, my union is already on this. I was told that I could make an appointment to get my belongings out of my classroom. This is where I may be the a-hole. When I first got into this class room it had nothing on the walls and no lessons ect. Not only did I pay for materials to teach with but I bought and used my own laminator to put posters on the walls. Think visual schedules and rules. My plan is to go into my classroom and take everything that belongs to me. This means there will be no more visual schedules and no more work. All walls will be empty. All posters will be gone since I paid for all these things and I have the licenses for them.

WIBTA if I kicked my classmate off my discord group?,"



Every semester before classes start I create discord groups for each one and send out invites to all my classmates so that we can study together. After creating almost a dozen discord groups throughout the year, I have this one class that you usually take after a prerequisite class and apparently one of my classmates was taking that prerequisite as well as this class at the same time and was having a hard time catching up. (Prerequisite class is chapters 1-12 while this class is chapters 13-21) he found out that I had passed my previous prerequisite class with an A and has been demanding that I send him my notes, my quizzes, etc. However, I don't have any of those because we used Wylie Plus for this particular class Even though I have told him this multiple times, he keeps messaging me on discord asking me for notes and what the quizzes look like? What does the midterm look like?  This person went as far as to ask me if they could come over to my house and check out my computer to see if anything was salvageable and this is a remote class where everything is online. So after warning him to stop messaging me about this multiple times, he still decided that he wanted to go ahead and ask me questions about this class that I took over a semester ago and it's really starting to get annoying. Our current class however, is coming up on its first midterm and I really don't want to do this but I can't deal with him messaging me anymore, so would I be the a-hole if I kicked this person off my discord",Not the A-hole
AITA for keeping this secret for my mother?,"So my Father just called me and told me a whole lot of stuff, but we're gonna focus on one major thing right now. I kept a secret for my mother about her having a new boyfriend from my father.

For some context my parents started getting a divorce about a year ago and only finalized it before about early July or late June. To awnser it now I don't know why I've been told about a hundred reasons as to why it could have been by both parents and am not in the mood to go over it again so please don't ask. Now then for some more of the context without my ranting, she got together with an old friend of her's from when she was 16ish (from what I can tell it was during the divorce that this happened) and told me and my siblings about it a month or so on after it was all finalized. When she told us she asked us not to tell our father about it so, out of a desire to avoid and major drama because of it we agreed (this is where I'll need you to consider about if I'm the A-hole in a bit). 

Skip a few months later to the actual story when, while my siblings are getting swapped between my mother an father they get into a fight and my mother tells him about her new boyfriend.  Me and my siblings hadn't been saying anything about it cause my dad seemed to finally be healing from the whole situation and moving on, so when she told us about the fight I was paralyzed with a sense of dread. After that there was nothing for a little while other than a call while I was traveling (don't have a license yet) and he vents a bit about things yesterday, today is when things happen. He called me maybe 40 minutes ago about something else and it eventually got to him talking to me about things again, he then asked me if I already knew. 

I was tired of lying to him and because of the other topic in the discussion I just didn't have the willpower to do it anyway. I said yes and he broke down after that. He said that now that he knew we were already aware it hurt him even more, and that it hurt him that we were being taught it was ok to lie to him. I just primarily stopped talking after that and the rest is a blur of a conversation. It hurts me to know that I've hurt him but I only did it because I didn't want anything to start up because of it and I expressly didn't want to hurt him.

I dunno, I probably could have gone about things differently but I didn't, and now I gotta know from an objective source. Am I the asshole here? My father may have deserved to know in some sense but I was just trying to do what I thought was right at the moment.",Not the A-hole
AITA for being mad at my parents?,"I (17f) recently started to resent being around my parents. So background, my mom just got engaged recently and I don’t hate him or my new sister. I love them both a lot. We all are a family and I thought we all supported each other but then school started and I started noticing a pattern. If my brother needed to be picked up from football they would rush to pick him up, but if I needed a ride after theatre I had to walk home. If my other brother needed to be watched, I have to drop anything I had planned to watch him. My moms been to 4 of my shows out of the 20 I’ve had but she’s been to almost all of my brothers football games. I thought this was all in my head but then my sister talked to me and realized she had notice my parents not putting me first for literally anything. I guess you could say I feel abandoned and unimportant to them. Recently I’ve been more mad at my parents because they told us my mom was pregnant which I’m excited so much for them until they told what day the baby’s due. My birthday is the due date. I’m still so excited for baby to come but I know my 18th will now not be about me, which sounds selfish but it’s the only time my family pays full attention to me instead of my siblings. If the baby’s early then my parents will miss my graduation. I was feeling upset that again they might now be there to support me and when I brought this up to them calmly they yelled and told me I was being selfish and self-centered. So my question is am I the a-hole for being mad at my parents and should I just let all of this go?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not being on my phone while driving?,"I (20F) made a promise to myself when I started learning how to drive to not be on my phone at all when the car is in motion.

I put my phone on silent and in my bag which is behind the driver’s seat. I check my phone before I start the car and when Ive gotten to my destination/when the car engine is off.

Ive gotten comments for it from my mom and some of my friends. Its mostly “what if theres an emergency and we need to call you? What if your boyfriend remembered something you needed to buy at the grocery store?”

Imo, if there is an emergency: you should call 911 and not me. Ive gotten into way too many almost-crashed incidents because the other drivers were on their phones. I also have no problem driving back to the grocery store to get one item if I forgot it. 

Its not like Im ignoring them and their messages, Im simply trying to put my life first and then them in second.

 Some still say im the A-hole when ive literally been in the car with the same people and theyve almost crashed because they were scrolling Instagram.

AITA for pretending to listen to my handicapped mom,"My mom has speech difficulty; most people don't really understand her when she talks and I mostly rely on being very attentive and lip reading to understand her. However she has a chatty personality and often rants/gossips/vents to me. Things do get heavier for me because of it since I also have issues of my own but it's really not all that bad. I love her. I want her to feel like she's being listened to despite her condition.


But oftentimes I just don't understand her. So she would talk for minutes and I'm there, nodding at her, appearing attentive since I don't have the heart to tell her I'm understanding nothing. 


Side note: She also tends to get angry if she ends up repeating herself since I couldn't understand her the first time - this happens a lot which is also one of the reasons I couldn't just say flat out that I couldn't keep up. Her anger/irritation goes from 0 to 100 in a heartbeat which affects everyone in the house - she'd end up getting mad at all of us for that one slip up.

I see he's married to an Asian woman. The wife comes on and backs him up on saying he's not racist. His dad which is my uncle (between 70-80yo) tells me that I need to apologize and that was uncalled for. My uncle also said ""that's where it started. He's not a racist for saying he got COVID-19 like that."" I explained to my uncle that what his son said was racist because the virus is not a race and saying that made-up word is degrading Asians. I also told his son that you can be a racist and still be in a marriage, have kids, and be friends with the group or groups of race that you hate/despise.

AITA for refusing to NOT hate my father after what he did?,"When I was a kid, I (18 F) knew that both of my parents had kids with their first family and strangely, I'm fine with it. My father was always so strict with my mom. Granted, he provides us with whatever we want. However, he NEVER wants mom to go outside. Even just buying groceries? No, he'd get all pissy and say that she only wants to go outside to meet with a man. Even when she smiles while chatting with her friends, he'd get mad at her and take her phone. My mom is a people person. She got pregnant with my half sister at 18 and never got to enjoy her teenage years. She likes hanging with her friends but can't do what she wants because my dad insists she stay at home and play the ""dutiful wife"" role. She loves him so she complies. 

Years later, we found out that the reason he's like that is because it's HIM has another woman.  And two kids with the said woman, both a year older than me. Which means he's been seeing that woman while I was still in my mother's womb. And for some reason, he would leave us for months, without money or anything and casually pops back as if nothing happened. Every time this happens, my mother would lock herself in her room and cry. I'd be the one taking care of her at the age of 9, making sure she eats, bathes and not harming herself. She'd go crazy with grief and barely move from the bed until he returns. And when he does, she cries to him, thanking him for returning. And he'd disappear again, leaving us with nothing. 

Until he leaves permanently. 

My mother got so depressed. My mother was an undergraduate so it's hard to find a job for her ( not that she's looking for one. she was too unstable at that time. ) And I don't know what to do. I would take care of my mother, ask the neighbors for food and try to ration out whatever remains of our money. 

Recently, she has new friends and several suitor. My sister sends us money and my mom herself has a stable job. But whenever the topic of my dad comes up, she keeps insisting that I DON'T get mad at him because he gave us whatever we wanted back when he was still with us. That he was a good husband and father to us and that instead of getting angry, we should be grateful to him. 

I tried convincing myself to think that way too, but it doesn't sit right with me. My father wants to reconnect with me and my mother told me to agree, even after hearing that he has a new wife. My mother keeps insisting that I was basically spoiled growing up and my dad loves me very much because I'm his only daughter among ALL his kids, but I downright refused and told her I don't want to forgive him for all the damage he did not just to ME but mostly to her. My mother got mad at me, so did my sister. but my brothers understood. 

Until today, my mother would make scornful comments about how ungrateful I am and how I should know how to appreciate him. Am I really the A-hole here?",Not the A-hole
AITA For not offering my mom a week on our couch while shes in town?,"For several reasons my mom and I don't have a good relationship. She has narcissistic tendencies and gets mad when she can't do what she wants or if I put boundaries in place regarding myself or my kids. I went through a lot of emotional abuse and manipulation growing up. We've gone to counseling a few times but she never follows through with the counselor recommendations.
Recently she is visiting from out of state and asked to spend a few nights at our house after staying with some extended family the first part of her visit. My husband and I said yes to this and she knows the only place we have for guests is the couch as our other rooms are for our kids and plus they are young so beds are to small for adults.
When I dropped her off at the extended family's house the daughter pulled me aside and explained how she's not happy about this and she's my mom sleeping on their couch. I explained I only had a couch for her to sleep on to and asked what she's not happy about as my mom asked to stay a few days only with me and we said yes. She didn't answer and just walked away. She obviously thinks my mom should be at my house all week.

AITAH for talking back to my mom?,"So I am 19F who have big insecurity problems from my entire family. Always been told I’m fat, this would make me fat, you’re too skinny, you’re so ugly because of acne, no guy would ever love me, etc. I told them, especially my mom I don’t like how they talk to me. How it caused me to have depression, insecurities, anxious etc, etc. they, especially mom thought it was all non sense but stop after I quit being nice and staying quiet.

This year, I’ve been high and low on my self confidence, meaning there will be days I love myself but days I feel disgusting and worthless. 

But anyway, onto the story. I’m just eating desert that I bought after I had dinner. While my mom is eating besides me. Out of nowhere, she made a “joking” comment “you’re going to get fatter.” Then I snapped because one, this isn’t the first time she out of nowhere bring this up and two I stated my boundaries multiple times so she know how I upset I’ll get when she disrespect it.

Back to the story, I told her off. I told her if she keeps eating that has fat or oil in them, she’ll be fat. Then she gonna attack me for my weight so I told her she’s the one who freaking fat, look at your stomach. This might be where I could be the a-hole because she had 4 children (I’m the youngest) and she self-conscious of her weight.

She told me to stop, I’m being mean. I’m talking to you “normally.” I told her off, by telling her maybe she shouldn’t have made that comment. I never told her to give me your opinion, I never told you to come and talk to me about how I’m getting fat. I’m just sitting here, minding my own goddamn business. Somewhere along those lines. After that, she left the table with a frown on her face and not talking me, the usual after I get mad at her for being rude about my weight/how I look.

Other than making that after affect pregnant comment, AITAH for going off on my mom for making a comment like that?

Note: if she worried about me being overweighted, then there’s nicer way to put it. She had it put it in a nicer way and at a different timing, I wouldn’t get mad. I wouldn’t see it as her crossing my boundaries. 

And Ik some may say move out or be in a dorm. One, I don’t have the money, and two I’m not doing to college because my mental issues and the traumas that I went thru couple months prior. Planning on saving as much money I can to move out with a friend. Once I have enough money that’ll last us until we could find a job near our new place.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I told my SIL and BIL no one will watch their kid on the family vacation?,"I married into a decent sized family who loves taking family vacations together. That's 12 adults, and 6 kids, aged young teen to baby. Recently we decided to discuss a new vacation idea to Europe, and the adults were super excited. In discussing the location, the types of things we would want to do, the topic of costs and entertainment for the kids developed, and it was here that most people felt it wouldn't be as fun for the kids since most of them do not care for historic things, lots of walking, etc., and that this would probably be better as a adult only vacation. Here is where SIL/BIL come in, when the topic of leaving kids came, we heard ""well my one kid will be going regardless, its too amazing an opportunity for them to miss!""

This is where a sidebar/explanation is needed:

My SIL/BIL tend to dump their kids on other people, especially my MIL/FIL. At this isn't just family vacations, this is family gatherings, outings, random occurrences etc. I have witnessed on multiple occasions one or both of them coming in and asking if someone is free on a set day, and once confirmed then say ""so we need you to watch so and so as we want to go out"". Again, usually on my MIL. She loves being a grandma, and is the sweetest person on earth, and never says no to people unless its for health/safety. The few times she has said no, I literally see her die a little inside, seriously best person award right here, (sorry I will stop now).

As I was saying though, every. single. vacation. without fail, someone, (usually MIL) is told, not asked, TOLD, they are watching their kids so they can go have dinner together, go do an excursion, or if at a theme park, ride rides. They literally plan their own family trips with just MIL/FIL so they have a babysitter 90% of the time, so they can go off together. So with this in mind, I knew that if their kid or kids go, MIL/FIL will be tasked with keeping their kid(s) entertained so they can go gallivanting off.

In that moment I went to say something but my husband, who knows me all too well, held me back and asked that I wait, as nothing has been confirmed, we were literally spit balling ideas, and to be gentle and non-accusatory when we do discuss kids going.

Would I be the a-hole if they mention again that their kid or kids are going, I say ""then I want you to understand now that no one will be watching your kids the whole vacation. If everyone else is leaving their kids at home, you need to treat this as if we weren't there. even if all or some of us are staying behind and not going out, you HAVE to take your kid out with you or stay in as well. we are choosing to do child free and if you decide your kid must go then they are your responsibility no matter what!"" My MIL has never been to Europe, and I want her to enjoy herself and not have to worry about having a child dumped on her.

last comment, my BIL/SIL are not bad ppl, this is the one thing they do that sucks. otherwise they and the rest of my family are amazing!!!

mini update: wow thank you all so much, I tried to keep up and talk with everyone who commented and gave advice but there were a lot! I appreciate everyone who said something, both who think I am and am not the A-Hole. A lot of you had great advice, and the discussion is coming up in a few weeks as a family, and one of the cruise lines is kid free, so if thats the one people agree to it will solve the problem, and if we go with another, then I will talk to my MIL/FIL privately and not only say my concerns-kindly and politely, but ask what they would like me to do and if I should stay out of it. I love all of my family, and while I love vacations with my nieces and nephews, I also love my adult family members and just want everyone to have the most fun.",Not the A-hole
AITA for unintentionally leaving out a classmate?,"I'm a male, 24 years old now, and this incident happened around 2007, when I was in 4th grade.

So on this day, my teacher was sick so a Substitute Teacher was called in, I'll call him ""Mr. H"". So Mr. H had a list that our teacher wrote down for him on what we were gonna be doing today, and one of those things was a small group activity.

It didn't take long for that time to do that group activity to come. Now, I don't remember exactly what Group Activity to was (it was 15 years ago, after all), but everyone else had a group, except for me and this other girl, named ""Kathy"" (Not her real name). Kathy and I went around the Classroom looking to see if anyone was gonna take us in but no luck. 

Mr. H caught on to this, and asked me and Kathy why were not in a group. We just shrugged, and Mr. H then told us ""Well, don't just walk around looking like stray puppies, find a group.""

""Wow, thanks for the help"" I said internally. Eventually there was a group of that was willing to take us in... or so I thought. This group welcomed me with open arms, but what I did not realize, was that they pushed away Kathy! I went into this group thinking they accepted both me and Kathy, but I only realized that they didn't, when Mr. H yelled at my group, saying ""Hey! Why did you leave Kathy out!?""

That was when I turned around, and there was Kathy, sitting at her desk crying. I felt so bad when I saw her cry the way she did, and Mr. H made feel even worse when he gave me a disappointed look. She eventually found a group that took her in, but that didn't make me feel any better. The group activity was fun, but, I wasn't enjoying it at all. All I was thinking about was how awful of me for not getting Kathy in the group that took me in.

She eventually got over it, but that day still irks me anytime it comes up.

AITA for being upset with my mum?,"English is not my native language so keep that in mind
I (17f) am upset because my mum (49f) didn’t go to the city with me and forgetting the things I tell her. for some background information; my birthday was about 2 weeks ago and my mum gave me a sketchbook with saying that we will go to the the city to go shopping together. I live in a smaller village and although the city isn’t far from us I was excited to hear that since we haven’t been going out together since pre covid. Now yesterday me, my brother (25M), his girlfriend (25M) and my mums boyfriend (55M) got into an argument. The boyfriend made a sexist joke towards my brothers girlfriend but then retracted it and made it towards all women, his joke was that women are men their personal breeding machine. I have told him many times I don’t condone sexist jokes/comments since they most of the time genuinely hurt me. Now the relationship with my mums boyfriend was already on a small thread for me and for my bother, he threatened us in the past (although my mum doesn’t see it like that) he said that if we were his kids he would made sure we wouldn’t be able to walk and not feed us for 5 days, he also abandoned us in an unknown city about 8 hours away from our home. he did/said many other things but that’s another story. back to the argument from yesterday, he got upset and demanded an apology from us for saying he was sexist, which we did not call him we just said that he made sexist jokes/comments in the past and now did it again and because of that we assume he will make those comments and or jokes it in the future too. We did not apologise and he stormed off calling us all sorts of names, cussing at us and saying how we are ruining my mums life/love life because we cannot be on 1 line with him. After he drove off to his house my mum had a small chat with us about how we need to listen to each other more etc. She then drove off to his house and stayed there overnight. I messaged her yesterday after she drove off if we are still going to the city today and she said she will think about it. Today I got the message asking if I’m free this Saturday, I already knew it was because she wanted to go to the city then and not today but I told her that I’m going to a Halloween dress up party, which upsets me that she didn’t remember that since we have spoken about it about 20 times without exaggerating it. Then she asked if I was free next Saturday and that she is not feeling it for going to the city today. That also did upset me cause I’ve spoken to her about how I’m working a lot next week as I have worked a lot last week and this is really my only week I work less and have no school. I think I’m more so upset about the fact she forgets the things I’ve spoken to her about many times then the date change, but now I’m starting to wonder if I’m the a-hole for getting upset about this.

We gradually became closer and became a group it was great Alex apologized for everything and we put middle school behind. I trusted Alex with a lot enough to recommend her to an academic program which was the biggest mistake as she likes to skip class and believes she can get away with everything because she’s a senior in the program even tho She has no position of leadership. Many of the people on the program started to notice her behavior and because I was the one to recommend her it give me a bad image. I tried to tell her this but she always says she won’t get caught. But a teacher already came and told the program leader about her skipping class. In this program she met  a girl and soon met her boyfriend since that she has done a full 360 and it turn to middle school all over again.

AITA for not taking back my invitation,"AITA
Im a co parent to 2 amazing children with my ex wife.
We were married for 7 years and have been divorced now 8 years
My daughter lives with me full time while she goes to school and my son whos homeschooled splits time between both households but this year has spent a majority of time at his mothers.
We live in different states, so there is a lot of airfare for the kids which does add up finacially.

My daughter a freshman in high school recently made it to the state tournament/championships for 3 different events in choir/music.
She of course is over joyed and wants her mother to come watch her perform and support her. 
Her mother is concerned about the financial burden of missing work and flying out for 72hrs so in an attempt to lessen that burden i offered her a place to stay at my home(i have a guest bedroom)
She has yet to commit to fly out or take me up on my offer of a place to stay but my GF wants me to take back my offer to let her stay with me.
She says it makes her uncomfortable the ""relationship"" we have and she wants me to not allow her to stay with me(if she even decides to come out).
I asked my gf to come stay with me during that time(she refused) and i even offered to go stay with her while my ex was at my house(she also refused) she only wants me to take back my invitation.
She(my gf) is claiming im choosing my ex wife over her, claims its humiliating and that im gas lighting her to think me and my exs relationship is normal.

AITA for wearing my best friend's hairband on my wrist,"  I recently got a new girlfriend who is upset I wear my best friend’s hair band on my wrist. I have been doing it for years it is not her original hairband as they fray overtime, but it is the same brand. I explained to her that it is because I used to work with her four years ago and she would forget to wear one as we worked in a warehouse, and you need to wear one while inside and always forget one and so I would wear one just in case she forgets it. She died in a car accident right before I left the job where we worked together. She has been my best friend since childhood. 

 I figured that would be enough for her to not bring it all the time. I honestly did not want to tell her the reason, but she would bombard me with things like it is because you are in love with her, and you cannot let her go even if you are with me. So, when I told her the reason she lashed out and called me a A-hole because I made her look like the bad guy. I told her its just comforting because I miss my friend.

AITA for not replying to my friend's vent,"This is my last resort for a third-party opinion because I'm genuinely confused about whether I'm the a-hole. 

I (F18) am on a Discord server with very close online friends (I'll be using fake names) where we can talk about our own interests, show art, and even vent in certain channels for others to listen in. We all live in different time zones and have different schedules, but up until now, that hasn't been a problem. 

Well on October 23rd my friend Sabrina tagged all of us in a text where she said that everyone in the server had been ignoring her and my other friend Kat. She said we haven't been replying to them and always leave them out of things. I'll be honest, I wasn't texting back to people as much as I hoped to but I genuinely didn't mean to seem like I was ignoring them. Me and everyone else apologized and said we'll make sure to not make them feel ignored. I made sure to reply to them all the time, even if I was just sending a small message to make sure they knew I saw it. On October 30th Kat told us they were happy to be friends with us all and that they loved us to which we all replied back saying to same to them. This made me think that all was well between us.

Yesterday was Halloween and I woke up late (around 2 pm) and didn't get on my phone until around 2:30 pm. As I was just seeing everyone's text I saw Kat texted in our vent channel saying 

""Sabrina thank you for actually tryna be here for me unlike some ppl."" 

I got confused and went to see what had happened. It turns out Kat's guinea pig had passed away and they were venting, but that was at 12:30 pm, nearly two hours ago when I was asleep. I went to text my other friend Blair telling her what Kat had texted. Blair said she couldn't text back because she was in school and her school is strict about having phones out. Blair responded in the vent channel, and Sabrina joined in. I forgot about the whole thing and went to celebrate Halloween. 

Well as I was celebrating (around 8 pm) Sabrina texted publicly a text Kat directed to us (specifically me and Blair). Basically calling us fake, annoying, saying our chats are uninteresting and annoying, and stating they're cutting us off. We were confused because since the 23rd we'd been replying to everything they and Sabrina texted, and even going back to Kat's past text in the server Blair had replied to everything and so had I. Me and Blair explained we literally could not have replied since I was asleep and Blair was in class. Sabrina and Kat have yet to text us about it even after Blair and I apologized yet explained that this is the first time we replied late after the first time we were told we were ignoring them. 

Kat had blocked us and Sabrina is sticking to their side. Me and Blair don't think we were the a-holes as this was the first time we don't reply (for good reason). Me and Blair are more upset about the fact Kat was super rude to us and insulted us but we also know Kat just lost their pet so we're conflicted.

AITA? Uninvited Possum at a Hens do,"AITA for getting upset at a stranger bringing a baby possum into my home without asking permission?

So, a while back, a friend of mine got married and I was her Maid of Honour so naturally, I threw her hens do/Bachelorette party. We have a reasonable sized house so hosted it at my place and due to bad weather it was inside instead of in the planned gazebo.

My friend is a vegan animal rights activist and so are a lot of her other friends, this I know and have no issues with. I made sure the food was vegan and everyone was comfortable. There was one guest who kind of avoided me for the first few hours and I still do not know her name. I didn't think much of it at first since there was plenty of people.

A couple of hours in, I noticed she kept reaching into her satchel bag with bits of food, I overheard her say to someone about having a possum. I assumed she meant at home and she was taking the food home for it.

No. 

A few more hours go by and we have migrated into another room, sitting down talking and having a few drinks. Then she pulls out a baby freaking possum! Turns out it's mother had been killed so she was hand rearing it.

It gets worse, she then takes some folded up toilet paper and sits it over the paper to poop. I sat on my couch, dumbfounded that a complete stranger bought a wild possum into my house and it was having its butt wiped after pooping while sitting on my couch. Noone else had any issues, they loved the baby possum. I probably should have said something at this point but I was in absolute shock.

Thankfully, they left not long after. I waited until after the wedding to bring up the possum to my friend so as not to stress her out and she genuinely saw NO issue with the whole thing. She thinks I over reacted to the possum as it was in a bag most of the night.

I have 3 cats, no idea if the possum had had any shots or if it carried any diseases and no idea what kind of risk it posed to my animals. I also dont think it would have gone down nicely if my cats had seen the possum in the house  as they are cats and it was a strange small furry creature in their home. New Zealand possums are small so it had the chance to go really bad.

It has somewhat tainted the relationship due to the total disregard for my home. Neither my friend or the guest asked if it was ok to bring the possum into my home or had any issue with potentially exposing my cats to diseases.

Am I the A-Hole for being annoyed over having a stranger bring a secret possum into my home and then have it pooping on my couch (into her tissue covered hand)?


EDIT:   I forgot to add an important part... one of the other guest had bought her 2 small children, which is  what it is... THE POSSUM SCRATCHED THE SMALL CHILDS FACE! To which, the guests reacted with ""well, the child needs to learn"". 

Mum of the children then proceeded to put her kids in my bathtub. Again, without asking...

AITA for not wanting to take my Grandma to see my disabled father?,"Sry English is not my first Language but i try my best.

Situation:

I 25f am visiting my father 51M at his disabled home he is permanantly staying in November. He had a stroke when i was 16 years old which hit me quite hard. He is clear in his head but lost feeling in his right arm and leg. Now my Nana 84F wants to visit him this year and is calling me like every two days.

To understand our family dynamic i will need to explain some stuff:

&#x200B;

1. My Parents are divorced since i was 2 years old and both had new partners when i was 4/5. I never remember the two of them together and i never had any problems with the new partners. 
2. My Father meet his new Girlfriend when i was 4 - They never Married because both think its quite stressfull and not worth it. They are still together! 
3. My Nana never liked my Stepmom - i dont know why but she always told me that my Mom is her only DIL.  
4. Because my father lived some hours away i only visited him in weekends and when i got older on my holidays. His disabled home is also a few citys away where he lived (about 2,5 hours away from me)

&#x200B;

Now my Nana never actually activly tried to be in my live before my father had his stroke besides giving me some money for my birthdays, with luck even a call.

 When my father got ill the doctors didnt know if he even made it trough the week. Nana called my mom that she and my uncle (her son) his wife and both my cousins visit my father to say goodbye and i should not see him. Because it could hurt me. I was livid at both my mom and Nana. If he died i never would have gotten the chance to say goodbye at the hospital where he perhaps could have heared me in his last hours. He thankfully survived. I also talked with my mom about it and we are good. 

Since i was 17 i had my car and my license she calls quite a lot more. The reasons is to drive her around to the grocerie store or to visit my father. And each time is more tiring than before. 

The last few time i took her with me to visit my father where - 2,5 hours uncomfortable driving my car, listening to her complain, gossip, bitching. There where a time where she peed in my car without telling me she has to use the toiled while we where on the road. I was not happy but she is quite old.

Even my father is not always happy that she visits because he finds her just as exhausting.

Now in November i will visit him and i invited his girlfriend and her mother (both a nice people) to go to a restaurant together. And i know my Nana would not be happy about it.

Would i be the A-Hole for not taking her with me to visit my father?",Not the A-hole
AITA For outing my father after his death?,"A little back story myself (M 52) and my father have been estranged with very little contact since I came out as a teen and he threw me out of the house. We are a large family with many siblings my mother sisters and brothers all get along great parents were already divorced. I'm now married to a great guy and we have two adopted teen sons. 

Even though I live a thousand miles from my mother and siblings we stay in touch and visit each other on the regular. I had known for years my father had moved to the same town we live in and I have tried several time to get in touch, have him meet hid grandsons it was always to no avail.  

So needless to say I was shocked when a attorney contacted me stating my father had passed and had left his ""estate"" to me as sole beneficiary. Sorry I didn't mention none of my siblings had any contact with him for years. After all the law stuff was done I went to see the house he had lived in and left me. With the help of my oldest son we started the task of cleaning out the house, selling items, donating others and so on. It was my son that found a box buried in the back of the closet filled with love letters between my father and another man, the letter talking about when they are together, touching, kissing, making love and even some a bit more graphic. I was in shock yet again took the box home and read through most the letters. 

A few days latter when talking to my sister on the phone I told her about the box and the letters. She said I was lying that I was just getting revenge on a dead person and it was just because he treated me like crap after coming out so I packed up all the letters and shipped them to her house. I have no idea if she or any of my siblings read them or not but they are all calling me saying I had no right to out him and they didn't need to know. So am I the a**hole?

AITA for not attending family events because they make it feel like my autistic child is not welcomed due to some of his behaviors?,"Last update:
I know I’m not the best at explaining, but this is my life and I wanted somewhere to vent because I’ve never had such an event occur with my children because we usually just keep to a close group between my best friend and her family. But, we Went to SIL and grandmother in laws to discuss with the cousin watching our child after work: SIL said she automatically accused without really acknowledging the situation, due to the full stress of the holiday. She stated that one of her children out of her five that is around the same age as him thought he wouldn’t get in trouble because of his disabilities so they pointed fingers at him. It was multiple children who ended up rough housing and knocked it off the wall. The cousin said our child was overwhelmed and left to room and went into the bathroom until I had yelled his name after him being blamed. Grandmother and SIL both profusely apologized and offered to do more things to get to know him better. I however said it’s going to take some slow steps and I accepted the apology. My husband seemed really quiet about the situation and I expected to hear more from him and for him to really be present for our child. I’ll take the apology and just move on but I will still continue to work with all three of my children and make them better human beings. I appreciate everyone who’s taken the time out to see both sides and try to be understanding and those who were kind and gave good words of advice. Thank you. 

Update:
After further discussion between my husband, the adult who was supervising our child and myself. The adult said my child was in the bathroom when the event occurred. My husband and I will be going over after work today to discuss the event that occurred. Will update later today. 


Todays Easter, my child is 6 and is autistic and has adhd. My child is also basically non verbal. knows simple words; like yes, no, please, thank you, poop, etc. They can hardly put a sentence together. Today they pulled down something hanging in the living room of my gram in laws. The item was repaired and hung back up and looks better than it was initially. I offered to pay for it and even put my child in time out. But to distract my child and to keep them occupied close to me, I gave them my phone and put on YouTube. We then were supposed to go watch a movie with my sister in law and her children and I wanted to ask permission to bring my children to her house. Which then she made very clear that no one likes my autistic child and that they aren’t welcome to any family event. I told my husband that I wasn’t going to attend anymore events until they can accept my child for how they are and that I will hold my own events for my children. I have now even told my husband that if they can’t accept them that I will cancel their birthday party because instead of paying for a big event for people to attend and swim at for someone they don’t like, then why should I even do it? He called me the a**hole and I am overthinking it.

AITA for not wanting to give up sick days to babysit?,"I recently started a full-time permanent job. My probation just ended, so I'm in the clear! I also volunteer on Sundays. I basically work Mondays to Fridays and Sundays and only have Saturdays to grocery shop and sleep in!

My twin sister is married and lives about 45 mins away. She has 2 kids and is always begging me to come visit. 

Before May of this year, I was working contract jobs. So, I had gaps in work where I could visit my twin and her family for a few weekends a month, or up to 2 weeks at a time. Today, I don't have that kind of flexibility or availability. 

Thinking back, it feels like the only time I used to get invited to my sister's place is when she and her husband want a weekend away so I can watch the kids. 

I currently haven't worked long enough for official paid sick days, but I got 3 freebies when I started (not really sick days, but they are paid days off) and I used one already to renew my ID. I'm honestly tired and would most likely only take another sick day to get more rest.

Would I be the a-hole for saying that I want my sick days for myself and would only visit when I'm not losing $$$ for her benefit only?

UPDATE:
My sister messaged me yesterday morning asking me again, if I'm available, so I sent my sister this message: 'Hey twinnie. Sorry, it's been a very hectic few days. I don't think I'll be able to come. It's going to be crazy when school starts and I wanna keep my only sick days in case I catch something. You guys ever consider a babysitter?'

AITA for not wanting to share my room with my grandpa?,"it's been 10 years since my grandmother passed away, and my grandpa has been living alone on his own. my parents didn't allow me to have my room until I became the age of 14. both of my parents are extremely nosy.

my grandpa recently had a brain stroke, he's 79 years old. the doctor told him to have someone to take care of him.My aunt gave him a choice to stay in her apartment as her daughter, aka my cousin, is really young, but he refused, saying he cannot tolerate her anger. my mom's house is the last option and if he stays here then I'll have to share my room with him.

AITA for not wanting to take care of elderly family members?,"For years, I have been cooking, cleaning, and doing light errands for two family members because they are elderly and they say they cannot do for themselves. They say they cannot afford food and they cannot afford a helper/housekeeper. They do not pay me, and finding money to buy their food stretches my budget considerably. 

Example: If I do not provide them with food, the two of them will eat a pack of those frosted Walmart cookies and that’s all they will eat for the day, and one of them is diabetic. The cookies are just an example of how they will not take care of themselves. 

However, they seem to be able to find the energy to take care of their youngest daughter, who is well into her 40s and capable of taking care of herself. They are constantly driving to her house four hours away to cook for her and take care of her household tasks. She works part-time, and she is a fully functioning adult. She has always been “The Favorite”. She is married to a healthy guy who also works part time. They only work part-time and somehow afford a primary home and a beach house, which I suspect was somehow funded by my family but cannot prove it. 

If they are capable of doing these things for her, they should be capable of doing these things for themselves. I tried to talk to them about this because I have a family of my own to care for, but they always have some excuse that they throw in my face to make me feel bad. They say things like: “She struggled with math as a child”, or “She’s a girl” (note: so am I), or “We don’t like her husband so we will just take care of her ourselves”, or “She just doesn’t know how to do this stuff/doesn’t have time/etc”.


I think I am the a-hole because one of them recently had an accident and couldn’t be left alone, so I stayed with them, then I got mad when the other one didn’t return from their daughter’s house in time for me to leave in time for a very important appointment they all knew I needed to attend.",Not the A-hole
AITA for wanting to wear a dress to my baby shower & being upset about people not being invited to our gender reveal?,"I (22f) have a son. I graduated at 16, turned 17 a week later & got pregnant. I had a long-term job as a server making good money. My life while pregnant was bad. My mom was very controlling. Some examples: she put a protective order against my sons dad under false pretenses, I wasn’t allowed to do anything without her, at work she called my managers to check on me, I couldn’t buy things for my son without her permission. If she thought it was too early/stupid/expensive I couldn’t buy it. I paid for everything for my son on my own, paid some house bills, paid my own bills, etc. Now, I am married (not my sons dad), we have our own home & we are expecting a child together. This was planned & we are excited. Things are very different this time. My sister asked if she can do our gender reveal & baby shower. We said yes & to include both moms in the shower. Everyone was ok with this. My sister wanted to do invites via a Facebook event & e-invites for those not on Facebook. She wanted to keep the reveal theme a secret from us so we weren’t a part of the event. We were worried about people not getting invited since she didn’t know all of them & she said that she would handle it & ask questions if needed. We said ok & gave her our guest list. She made the event a couple weeks ago but I found out that some people on our list weren’t invited. Whenever I told her that so-so wasn’t invited it was always “I’m blocked” or “I don’t know them”. Anyways, I found out that more people weren’t invited & I texted my sister. At first I showed her a dress I like that I wanted to wear to the reveal & she said she was having t-shirts made for it, I said ok I’ll wear it to the shower & she said she was having t-shirts made for that too. I asked her if we could do t-shirts for the reveal only. The shower hasn’t been planned & I want to wear a dress not jeans & a t-shirt. She was ok with this. I then asked her about people not getting invited & it was the same reply’s. I asked her to give me a list of people not invited so I could reach out to them. She lost it saying “I’ll just add you to the event, forget keeping the theme a secret, I don’t care, just forget the shirts.” She added me to the event even though I told her not to & to take me off if she did & I haven’t/won’t look at it. I tried to work it out but she ignored me. Hours later, I looked at it & she didn’t invite 75% of our guest list & invited some of her friends that weren’t on this list. When I showed my husband he told me to leave it alone & it wasn’t that big of a deal. I showed the conversation to our grandma & told her everything & she sided with me. When our mom asked what was going on I told her the same thing & she acted like she was on my side but then started talking to someone about me over reacting before she hung up.

AITA for telling my husbands family I would no longer run errands for them?,"This may be a long read, but intriguing read if you like in-law drama.
Bit of Backstory;
Me (f19) ans my hubby (m19) got pregnant and married young (marries 5 months and I'm  8 months pregnant) because we had the means to do so and my family helped. His family has always been on the poverish side and made really bad decisions (jail, drugs, bad friends). He is the only good apple. He works on railroads and make really good money. I'm a SAHW. Anyways I've always had frustration with how his family handle things and how they are ALWAYS in need of help. It didn't bother me until we made plans to get married. His mom gets arrested TWICE, first time misdemeanor offense a month before wedding, we bail her out. Second time felony offense for selling drugs, she misses our wedding (I may not ever move on from that because hubby was immensely hurt). Her daughter bails her our about 3 months later. During MIL sentence she calls hubby almost everyday and crys (never seen woman cry so much) begging for commissary money. Despite us being slightly poor he gives it, it causes arguments, I let it go. Now MIL is out of jail and free as a bird, she constantly needs our help. 

Now to what's happened in the past week...
Me being pregnant I got to the doctor about every two weeks (soon to be every week). I had doctor appointment on day she had court, and I already promised her a ride. I mention she may need another ride, she can't find one. Me being 33 weeks pregnant my back hurts and there's no relief other than hot compress, or bath. His family had been constantly asking for rides and errands to be done. Me being nice Daughter in Law and wanting husband to be happy I agree. I ended up having to set boundaries with MIL I tell her I cannot run errands because I do not feel appreciated when errands are asked of me, I hurt, I'm pregnant, and every time she would ask for ride somewhere she added 2 to 3 favors extra. I told her that I did not want to resent her because I was frustrated with her antics and that I would not run errands anymore. They have constantly asked for my help and I always did it. But now in laws have made it seem that I am a bad person and I hurt MIL feelings. MIL then calls SIL and SIL sends disrespectful message towards me saying I'm awful, I'm disrespectful, and that I need to ""make this right and be the girl we thought you were"". I send message back saying I've helped throughout whole pregnancy,  I hurt, and I'm not a taxi. Husband takes my side saying it's okay not to constantly run errands for them because I'm pregnant and I hurt. Husband talks to MIL trying to explain to MIL what I meant, MIL defends herself instead of trying to understand my side, so Husband leaves it there.

AITA I'm a Tattle Tale,"I (20F) am in an adult education class for a medical program of about 20ish students. This happened early last week where we had a female student who quit the class and kept asking a question if her past was going to affect her being able to get into this career field. She was a little weird but was very nice to everyone. Well getting to the part where I feel like I could be the a-hole, the class started talking about her on one of our breaks and were being really harsh in what they were saying about her. When I say the class, I mean about 4/5 of the class. They were saying they couldn't believe she was a mother, saying that they can't believe anyone would sleep with her, calling her ugly and fat, looking into her past, finding her social media, and being just plain rude. She is only in her 20s and is a young mom but I don't feel that should be an insult. We are in a medical field where compassion really is needed and I feel none was being given. Keep in mind she is no longer in this class and can not defend herself. Well I went and messaged the head of the program and told him about what was being said about this former student and he had a talk with them about how inappropriate it is but it is nagging at me. I was in no way close to her and barely spoke a couple sentences to her but it really made me mad/upset because I really did think these people were genuinely trying to help people. I feel like a tattle tale running to the head of the department rather than saying it to the class because we are all adults so I definitely feel I could be the a-hole because I sure don't feel I am acting like an adult. I just feel like I embarrassed myself to the head of the department and that the whole class might know it was me because I was practically the only one who didn't join in.

AITA for not wanting my older brother to take my trampoline so his girlfriend’s 7 year old son can play on it?,"I (26/F) bought my childhood trampoline from our dad since he wanted to sell it a few years ago. I planned for my friends & I play trampoline games in the summer.

When Summer came my friends & I ended up doing other things, and rarely visited my house (I still live at home) as one of my friends was afraid of/didn’t like dogs. (We have 2 very energetic & people loving Pitbulls.) So I didn’t use the trampoline. My older brother (37) asked if he could buy it from me, as his girlfriend/roommate had a young son with no friends (We’ll call him J, 7 now.) I told him I’d let him borrow it, but when I wanted to use it, I’d get it back. He lived about 25 or so minutes away, & He agreed. 

Sadly, my friend group ended up being toxic & we had a falling out. I was in a very bad depression, but in the past several months I found a wonderful group of new friends, & they love coming to my house & I’ve hosted weekly movie night at my house several times. With it getting warmer, we’re planning more outdoor activities instead of movie night. 

Bro., his girlfriend & J have been temporarily living just outside the house for the past couple of months in a trailer, so the tramp has been in the backyard. Bro. got a construction offer about 2 hours away, so all of them are going up there until Fall. On the trip to set stuff up, he took my tramp without asking me and my dad told him it was fine if he took it- again, giving him permission without talking to me first. When I found out a big fight ensued. 

My dad says he doesn’t want to move it to mow the lawn, but he never bothered to ask anyone else when it needed to be. He also argues one of the poles are rusted & all of my friends  jumping will break it- but then Bro shouldn’t be allowed to jump with J either. Something else, is Bro. Is known for not for taking good care of other people’s stuff to where my parents often won’t let him borrow things anymore & where they’re going is a mud slide hazard area. I also have my doubts if anything happens to it, my brother will pay be back.

 Bro ended up having to come back for a bit, & my mom brought back my tramp. However, everyone is trying to talk me into letting him take it back or sell it to him so J this can play on it, since they will be in the middle of nowhere, & he’s homeschooled. My family is treating me like I’m the A-Hole bc J will use it more, and most likely on a daily basis when I won’t. But, Bro said he plans on buying J a small dirt bike & having him help him to payback things he’s broken bc “He’s so careless with things”, & his step dad buys him RC cars, he has a switch, there’s internet, etc. So I feel like he’ll have other stuff to do, plus I bought this for me & my friends to use, even if it isn’t on a daily basis or even every week. It’s not about getting money by selling it or just to see someone else happy. It’s about the time with friends. I don’t have many years left where I’ll have friends with time or energy to do this with, but my family is guilt tripping me so I’m not sure.

EDIT: Ppl in the comments saying I’m TAH bc My dad had to move the tramp- Let me make it clear his issue isn’t with it being in the yard- it’s moving it. It’s only been in the yard for a few weeks- my dad NEVER at ANY point voiced he had an issue with moving it, Nor did he even ask anyone else to move it at any point in time. But, I’ll be moving it FROM NOW ON.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA If I told my parents they are being toxic in-laws?,"I am wrestling with the thought tonight as I (F23) am just about tired of my parents (F41) (M50). I currently live with my family as a graduate student. Last week I woke up to an argument between my mother and my little brother (M20) and his Fiancee(F21) They were high school sweethearts for context and furthermore his fiancee literally stresses out as my parents not only have a loud voice but also tends to yell at me and my brothers over the littlest things. For example: If my little brother would get a C on his paper in college, my dad would scold him as to why he did not let him go over his paper. You know the stereotype about the dad that would make you cry over your math homework? Well that is my dad in EVERY SUBJECT. My father tends to be too smart for his own good and my mother will leave tiny details out that can change whatever the story is. She has done this throughout my entire childhood and has verbally abused me before. They both have mellowed out for me at around the age of 20. However, here is where I would be the asshole, I am tired of my mom mocking my little brother's fiancee about how she is stressed in our home. (For context there was an issue in her old home where her parents would prevent her from seeing my little brother) I would like to remind my mother that she used to be the woman that my dad's mother (my paternal grandmother) didn't like. Yet she did not berate her right in front of my dad. But my mother would do so in front of me thinking I would agree. Now here's what happened that caused both my parents to dislike my little brother's fiancee. The fiancee is from a Muslim family and wants to go through the conversion process to Christianity. As anyone who has converted to one religion to another, this is a very big thing and nothing to just go,' yea Imma be Christian' As such she has a conflict of faith. She has been with my family and I to church non-stop (this would be her first time not going) Which caused the said argument and caused my mother to leave the house for a while in a fit of rage. To her credit, she is upset that they do not communicate on the other hand I understand where my little brother and his fiancee are coming from. I know my family's culture can be loud, but what my little brother's fiancee is telling me is that they would verbally berate my little brother over little things, which would surprise surprise make him depressed. I just want to know would I be considered the a-hole if I told my parents, 'Hey, have you considered what you're saying is completely unnecessary and rude. Calling anyone names or scolding someone is not going to get your point through.' I do not disagree with their overall message that both my little brother and his fiancee need to mature and communicate better, but what they do not need is the crazy MIL or the father that stonewalls the fiancee because of a quite frankly, stupid disagreement and a normal part of the process.",Not the A-hole
AITA for kicking out my fiancés sister and her husband after living rent-free in my house for 3 years?,"Since moving out of my parents home, me and my fiance lived at his sister’s husband’s house. All was well, but as time went on, I noticed they were lazy. I am a clean freak and this duo were the total opposite. Ever since we lived with them, we did most of the household chores and it was exhausting. I understand my fiance’s sister gets tired from work, but so do I! Even so, I still find a way to clean up, cook, wash dishes despite being sleep deprived while my fiance is at school. It was like that for a year until one day, when I was at work, my fiance called me and told me my son broke their glass dining table. I asked my fiance to immediately find a replacement and he did find one right away. My son was alright though. But later that day, my fiance’s sister messaged my mom and asked her to pick us up from her home because we were already “becoming a nuisance to them”(as she described). My mom then picked us up together with our belongings.

Fast forward to a year later, we got in touch again with my fiance’s sister and we became friends again. We forgave her despite what happened. During that time, my dad bought an old house and he said we can live there and we can have it renovated however we want. I was so thankful of my dad’s generosity. 

On that same year, my fiance’s mom who lived in another city wanted to spend christmas in our hometown. We offered the house that my dad gave us as where they could stay for the holidays. Then, my fiance’s sister and her hubby stayed too in that house.

Me and my fiancé have planned that once his mom leaves, we would start living in that house for good. However, once his mom left, his sister and BIL stayed. Did not even have the basic courtesy to ask me or my fiancé if it was okay. They just stayed and never left. What’s worse is, they haven’t changed a thing. They were still lazy and did not clean up after their mess. They rarely help with household chores still. To me, that was a very huge problem.


Despite it all, I kept my mouth shut. But after 3 years, I can’t take it anymore. I told my fiance he should do something about it. I expected that since they got free stay, free wifi, free electricity, free food, they should at least help me with chores but they rarely do.

My fiance told his mom about it. He told her to just be silent about it because he wants to be the one to talk to his sister about our plan. She sided with us at first but hours later, she got mad at us and told us we were selfish and inconsiderate for not understanding that her daughter was quite financially strapped as of the moment. Haven’t we been considerate for the past 3 years?

Since then, his sister never talked to us until 3 days later, she and her hubby left. We wanted to give them 2 mos notice but his mom did not respect our decision and sent the word ahead of us which exacerbated things and resulted in them leaving sooner instead. So, am I the a-hole for speaking up and deciding to finally kick them out? Tell me!",Not the A-hole
AITA for having a client pay full price for dog sitting?,I (14f) and my mother (42f) have a dog sitting business where we walk and also do overnight stays for clients. We’ve been dog walking for this older guy every couple of weeks for $15 a walk and we stayed the night once for $75 (for a night). This week he went away on vacation for 9 days to stay at his vacation house and we would walk his dog 3 times a day and stay the night (we also would feed his cat). So he is now back from his trip and he was asking for the price of our stay and my mom was worried we were asking for too much ($75 a night) and she did not want to ask him for full price. I on the other hand think we did our job and he knew the pricing before we went (because we have dog sat for him before) and he has sons he could have asked to dog sit for free. So we settled for reducing the price by $75 ($600) but my mom is worried about him being upset about the price (she’s really panicking because she feels bad)but I feel this is only fair. So are we the a-holes for asking for the full price.,Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to go to church with my mom's boyfriend?,"For a quick backstory, my [17F] parents have been divorced since I was 9 y/o. My mom recently got a boyfriend a few months ago. I'll call her boyfriend 'Fred'. We actually did go to church together about two or three times already, including with Fred, but I was with the entire family during those times. Fred has proven to be a good man overall, but aside from us exchanging greetings, he is still practically a stranger to me. 

My mom is currently out on a spiritual retreat. Yesterday, my mom texted me out of nowhere at 10am, saying that I need to get ready since Fred will be picking up my grandma and I for church at 5pm. No explanation, just telling me to please obey and dress up soon. 

Confused, I asked her if it was only going to be Fred, grandma, and I alone. She told me that Fred's mother would be accompanying us too, and I told her I wasn't comfortable with this. My mom then said that I couldn't stay at home alone, therefore I had no choice but to come with them. So I told her (basically) 'fat chance'.

She then suggested that I can call my dad to pick me up and watch me for the day, otherwise I had to accompany Fred. I called my dad, and he agreed to pick me up instead. I thought the situation would be resolved by then, but lately my mother has been responding my messages with short and oddly petty ones. 

For a quick explanation:
1) I can't stay alone at home without a guardian by my psychiatrist's orders since I'm diagnosed with depression. Yes, I'm being medicated. 
2) My grandmother tends to be very dependent on others. I'd be looking out for her more than she'd be looking out for me. Plus, she's already more well-acquainted with Fred than I am.
3) No, I do not hate Fred. I'm just still not completely used to being around with him yet, and much less spending time with him alone.

AITA For moving dishes to the counter from the sink?,"I don't feel like the a-hole but I'm starting to feel like one. I live in an apartment building with 2 other roommates (the building choose them not me). We have a common space Living room ,kitchen , laundry we each have a bedroom and bathroom to ourselves. I normally cook everyday (unlike my roommates) and wash my dishes after I eat or after I'm done with work for the night.

The other day my roommate caused a ruckus in the kitchen by dumping all the dishes in the sink. I was on a call with my manager for my weekly one-on-one when he asked me if I was getting robbed. I was pretty sure it was my roommates 'washing' their dished but I did it to clear his mind (he treats everyone on the team like family). When I poked my head out to check the kitchen my roommate said it was to keep the kitchen looking 'clean'. I shrugged and went back to my room and explained it to my manager only for my roommate to just go off yelling talking to someone else about it was 'talking behind some's back'. When I finally got to my computer my manager was appalled I shrugged and went on with my life.

I try not to complain about stuff my roommates do. Not when they leave dishes strewn around the kitchen for weeks at a time. They left dishes in the sink for weeks before washing them. Not when they have loud music playing past quiet hours (The building Quiet hrs start @ 10pm) and 3am. Not when they slam doors rattling my window at all hours and not when they leave their clothes in the washer and dryer on my only day off.

**Update:** So I finally had enough of my roommates disgusting habits after coming back to ants in the apartment, a moldy pot of spaghetti left over winter break in the dishwasher and decomposing food in the fridge. I confronted her and not the other because the other was sleeping, but the roommate I confronted threatened me and said 'You don't know where I'm from I will drag you out of here' as she was yelling in my face with her finger inches from my face. I was able to safely remove myself from the situation and sent an email to property management.. Now I don't feel safe in my own apartment. Did I say something wrong I just asked that they clean up after themselves and that I won't clean it because its not mine to clean up. She kept going on about I should do it as a human being(I'm allergic to mold so No to the food in the fridge and the pot in dishwasher) but now she's starting to make living in this apartment very hostile.

AITA for stating I don’t want kids in our apartment until my partner and I are financially stable?,"Hi! First post on here and it’s a bit of a ride, but here goes.

My (18M) fiancé’s (20NB) friend (20F) asked us a few days ago if we would be comfortable with her moving away from her parents house and in with us once we got a place. I was told her situation wasn’t the best there from my partner and I said I didn’t mind as long as they paid their fair share of rent/utilities once we got a place. Getting to know this friend more, she seemed genuinely cool and interesting and a great fit for a roommate. 

However, I wanted to list some rules/expectations before she thought about moving up here. I said I did not want kids in the apartment at all. None of us have career jobs. None of us are full time. We are not ready for kids. And in the American climate today, I don’t want to put a kid in our school system.

I also have moderate anger issues and a short temper while my fiancé has his own mental health issues as well. We both want to go to therapy and be the best parents we can be for our kid when we decide to have one.

I stand very strongly on not having/adopting a kid until either 1. Me, my fiancé, and whoever else are full-time or 2. One of us makes enough to where another doesn’t have to work and can care for the kid. I clarified that at the moment, if a kid happens to appear in anyone living in the house, it can not stay. Whether it’s moving out of the apartment (not kicking out, letting them find a place), safehavening the baby at a fire station, or aborting it before it comes to grow.

My fiancé’s friend says okay and she seemed fine with it as the conversation shifted to where we dreamed of moving to when we’re older. 

I wake up the next morning to a text from her stating she no longer feels safe living with us. I apologize for how we made her feel, but state we will not change what my fiancé and I have had planned for months just for her own sake. She said we were “not actually pro-choice” for us stating we would not have kids in our lives at the moment. 

Instead of discussing this issue further and possibly resolving it, she blocked me and my fiancé. My fiancé is understandably upset, as she had been his friend since middle school. My fiancé says I could’ve handled this better by asking for her opinion rather than stating it was a rule. He also said I should’ve ran the message by him first. However, he also stated that it wasn’t fair for her to tell us we weren’t pro-choice for not wanting kids right at this moment. 

I understand I may be the A-hole here, as it is her body and she would be paying her share of rent. I can’t tell someone else how to live, but we all would be sharing that apartment together.

I know I’m young and have a lot to learn, but a kid right now would make life a whole lot more challenging. I want to be financially and mentally stable before I have a kid. I still feel guilty for my fiancé’s friend blocking us, but I want what is best for us.

AITA For not visiting my mom who has cancer?,"So let me start off by saying that my mother and I have always had a strained relationship. She's narcissistic; she would often tell me everything I do is not good enough, and she has put me through countless traumatic things in my life. This is just to provide some context. 

I'm 28 now, married and moved out. My mom, unfortunately, was recently diagnosed with stage 4 Uterine Cancer. I want to be there for her, but it's been proving difficult to do so. Every time I go to see her, she berates me, let's me know how useless I am. She's now going around telling all my family, and some friends, what an ""uncaring, ungrateful, and spiteful daughter/person I am"" (her words, not mine). She's really good at manipulating people, and convincing them I'm not a good person, she's done this my entire life. No one has bothered yet to ask how I'm feeling or my side, but I digress.

 Apparently, my friend went to visit her the other day, and my mom had convinced her of just that. Trust me when I tell you, that I have tried, so hard and for so long, to be close with my mother, and every time I have, she shuts me out and gets abusive towards me. I'm hurt that my friend not only took my mom's side without even hearing what I have to say, but felt so compelled to tell me, as if I need to be more understanding. My whole family is being like this towards me atm, treating me like I'm an a-hole for not wanting to go over there for fear of being verbally abused. I'm just trying to do my best, but maybe I'm being too proud, or stubborn? I don't feel like I am? Am I the a-hole?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not dropping my crisis to help my sister?,"TL;DR: my sister wants me to bring her $20 while my boyfriend and I were actively breaking up. 


The other day my sister (23) and niece (2) came over to my (F34) house for a while. About 15 minutes before they left, the electricity went out in our neighborhood on a 100 degree day, and my jerk boyfriend and I got into an argument, so my sister packed up my niece and left (rightfully so). Not even 5 minutes afterwards, my phone rings. BF and I are still arguing and, quite frankly, deciding whether or not it’s a good idea to continue the relationship, but I see that it’s my sister so I answer. 

Now, I need to give a very brief amount of background here. My sister is very responsible with her money in that she doesn’t overspend or have outstanding bills. She has a bank account as well as a credit card, but has been utilizing Apple Pay frequently. Our city is still a little slow on adapting to other methods of payment, so it’s not always an available option. For some reason unbeknownst to me, she’s decided to stop carrying any cash or cards in favor of Apple Pay which then puts her in a bind, so she will ask me if I can pay for something and she’ll immediately Apple Pay or Zelle me. I have told her multiple times that she needs to be more responsible when it comes to this because I won’t always there to bail her out for this crap. It’s happened at least a dozen times in the last year. Back to the story.

I answer the phone, clearly upset and crying, and my sister says, “I’m at the gas station and they don’t have electricity either so I can’t use Apple Pay. I only have 9 miles left in my tank. Can you bring me some cash?” I said no, why don’t you have a card or some emergency cash? I’m in the middle of my own crisis and I can’t come right now. So she does that teeth-sucking noise and says “ohhhhhhhhhh, uh-huh, yeah, that’s fine, I’ll be okay, it’s okay” and hangs up on me. So now I’m really upset. I try to settle with the a-hole in front of me and send her several texts throughout the night to see if anyone came to help her now that I was less emotional/more rational/able to drive (my eyes swell when I cry hard) and she refuses to answer. I sent her a text today and asked her to see things from my point of view as this isn’t the first time it’s happened, what if I wasn’t in town or something, and that an emergency on her part doesn’t always constitute one on mine, and that I was in the middle of my own crisis, she basically said that she needed to “reflect and reevaluate our relationship as she (sister) clearly expects too much from me (OP) because she’d never leave me hanging and it was inappropriate for me to “teach her a lesson” while her daughter was with her. At what point do I get to stop bailing her out?!

"AITA For telling my ""overweight"" friend that I wanna gain a few pounds?"," I would like to know if I am the a-hole for telling my ""overweight"" friend that I wanted to gain a few pounds. This happened about a week ago and she haven't brought it up but I cant get it off of my mind.
When I was around two, I had a very abusive mother(lets call her M). My father and her where divorced while my dad had a girlfriend(now wife who I see as my mom). I went to M's  house on the weekend then I went to my dad's on the weekdays. I would come home to my dads starving cause she barely fed me, when she did it was a bowl of cereal to last me the day. I would always sneak food into my room as well, I had learned how to climb a baby gate.  
  My dad found this very concerning. Eventually my dad and mom got full custody of me. Even after I was away from her for years I still snuck food into my room. I knew I shouldn't and I didn't need to but it was a habit at that point. To this day I still do it. Its not as bad anymore about once a month.
 Every since I was little you could always put your hand under my ribcage or see it. I am very heathy and there is nothing physically wrong with me. But, I have always been very insecure about it. Most I tell don't notice till I tell them. 
 I have relatively big thighs, arms, and a face. Everything is normal, my only problem is  cant get any weight to my ribcage. I am 20 pounds under the normal weight for my age
 One day weight was brought up at lunch. I then told my bestfriend (Name:K) that I wanted to gain a few pounds. She then proceed to lecture me on how I shouldn't and that she was way to fat and she just wants to lose weight and I should be thankful that I don't gain weight for eating while then calling me a a-hole. I don't see her overweight in anyway she is very athletic and only 30 pounds over about our recommended weight. K is faster, stronger, and way more athletic then me. She has done three sports this year while I have done one.

WIBTA if I'll be petty enough to change hotel during a group's trip?,"Hi there!

So recently my boyfriend (M27) broke up with me (F22) while we were thinking to go live together. 

Hanging out with our friends (he's known them more than me) I noticed how everyone just ignores me all the time and follow him like some kind of alpha thing. He sits somewhere, they sit with him; he wants to go home, everyone wants to go home; he make plans, everyone is ok with him; etc..

I've really actually lost a friend of mine as well (F24) that I will call Cassie. Cassie gas known my ex for at least 15 years, but we were becoming more close than ever, almost sisters. When he broke up with me, suddenly he make plans with her and only then invites the group, she checks with him if he wants to go somewhere before saying yes, the gang out from day to night during the weekend, even with his parents, etc..

This situation broke me more than the breakup, and even though I talked to her, she told me nothing has changed, but still act like his girlfriend, somehow.

In a couple of months we had planned a trip in a place I've lived before knowing all of them, and we're supposed to be 6: me, my ex, my best friend (M23), Cassie and other 2 people, which are my ex's friend.


Since I already payed for the flight (it was supposed to be a gift for my bday) but not for the stay, I was thinking to take another hotel for me and my best friend to stay so I can enjoy my old place, see some old friends and have fun, instead of looking at all of them using me for the info about the place and to be their ""guide"" while being mean or ignoring me. Plus I hate to see my ex and Cassie together, always hugging and planning what to do the next day in front of me and I really need some me time.


So, Would I be the a-hole if I changed the hotel I stay at?


UPDATE

So I actually am going crazy about this situation in our (his) friend group. It really is difficult for me to make friends as I'm shy and introverted. I tried to talk to Cassie and she assured me she didn't notice what was going on but told me even her mom (everyone kinda knows all of the parents in the group) noticed my ex is replacing me with her. She sees him as a brother, so I assume she took his side at the end of the story and that's it. The other two friends have shown more interest in callin/texing me but still stand out of the situation between me and my ex. I'm not so sure about going to the trip anymore and just trying to be okay with losing my money.

UPDATE 2

So, a month after my breakup, my ex and Cassie got together.
I'm not going to travel with them at all.
I got my money back anyway since my ex gave me back the money I spent for him for another trip we planned to do together.

AITA for getting into a little car accident with my mother's car?,"English isn't my first language, so please excuse my writing.

I f(24) borrowed my mother's car for a little errand shopping a couple of days ago. On my way, I accidentally hit our neighbor's fence wile leaving our drive. Everything was fine, I contacted our neighbor, and we agreed on further actions. The resulting damages both on the fence and my mother's car were pretty small. The fence was slightly broken, and the car had a few superficial scratches. My neighbor also looked at my mother's car and said that there is nothing wrong and that those small scratches could easily be removed. I also took some pictures and send them to my boyfriend, and he also confirmed me, that the car is in good shape and nothing bad happened. I told my mother, and she was completely angry at me for damaging her car. It took her almost 3 days to calm down, and she screamed at me almost the entire time. I left to spend some time with my boyfriend for her to calm down. A few hours ago, my father told me, that they have to remove the bumper and that my mother is calling me the A-hole for ruining everything and that she has to spend a lot of money because of me. I’m a bit confused because the damage on the car is very small, and I confirmed with two different people that nothing bad happened. I also said I would pay for everything I broke, but this is a bit strange considering the fact that everything with the car was fine before I left and now out of the blue there is huge damage? 

I understand that she is angry, I would be angry too if someone destroyed something that belongs to me. But I think that her actions are a bit too harsh. I didn’t destroy anything on purpose, it was a small accident and her car was completely fine as I left.

AITAH for accusing the pharmacy of stealing my medication?,"I (60F) have been on a medication for many years for my ADD condition.   It is a scheduled 2 drug and must be strictly regulated.  It can only be be obtained one month at a time. A few days ago I went to pick up my subscription at my pharmacy.   This pharmacy is in a well known large super store where you can also buy clothes,  food,  appliances,  electronics,  you name it.  I'm trying to be careful because I don't know what the rules are in saying the name of the store, much less accusing them of this. 

The medication was put in a bag and stapled.  I pick up a few other items, pay for those and go home.  After I put those other items away,  I tear open the stapled bag that has my medication in it and open the bottle.  I had one pill left from my previous subscription and was going to put it in with my new bottle.   But when I opened the new bottle,  it didn't look right.   I have been on this medication for so many years that l know the exact level of where the pills land in the bottle with a new subscription.  I counted the pills and sure enough,  there are six pills missing.   I immediately went straight back to the store, it is only four miles from my house.   I told the staff at the pharmacy what has happened and have them recount the pills.   They also show it short by six pills.  They recount their stock.  There is no overage by six pills or any amount.  The person I talked to stated it simply could not be a mistake on their end because they have to count the pills three separate times with two people and this is done on camera. I said for six pills to be missing, this was more than just an oversight. She said she would check the camera and get back with me.

She called later that day and said everything was fine on their end.   She reviewed the camera footage and didn't see anything unusual.   ""Maybe someone got into the medication after you got home?""  I explained that no, the bag it was stapled in was in my purse and was opened almost immediately after I got home.  She reiterated the process the pharmacy goes through on camera of making sure the count is correct. She was very defensive and kept talking over me.  I finally got through to her that I didn't doubt what she was saying.   I told her I have left very good reviews about their pharmacy on their requested surveys.   I explained that I believed that their is someone on their staff who is waiting for that all to be done,  then taking pills out off away and the cameras.   I said, ""And if that is the case, I doubt I am the only one that is targeted.   If they are taking stimulants,  they may also be taking opiates and benzos.  After all,  how many people count their medications as soon as they get home?  If the thief(s?) are only taking a few pills at a time,  how many people are going to think to blame the pharmacy?""   ​

AITA FOR MAKING A SCENE IN A LAUNDRY MAT,"So I had a really negative interaction with someone else at a laundry mat earlier today and I've been thinking about it for about 6 hours now. I just can't sleep without getting some outside opinions about what happened and whether or not I'm the A-hole for the scenario.

I was in the laundry mat today doing laundry for my family of four.
At the time of the incident I had been in the mat for about 2 hours and my clothes had just finished drying. I used two  top dryers that were right next to each other. One dryer had finished and the other dryer ( on the left) had less than 5 minutes to go.  
I put one of my baskets under the first dryer in order to start taking my clothes out and walked back to where I was sitting to grab the second and third baskets.
While I was grabbing the second basket to unload the first dryer a random lady came up to my basket which was underneath the dryer I had been using and moved it out of the way in order to put her clothes in the dryer below.  I was only gone for about 4 seconds, and there were 4 other dryers to pick from so I don't really understand why she picked that one when she saw that I was about to get my clothes out.

I said to her ""Ma'am, I'm about to get my clothes out of the dryer"" she said ""ok"" and dumped her clothes into the lower dryer.  I then got my clothes out and put my final basket to the left under my second dryer which only had about 2 minutes left.

I got my clothes into the baskets and set the two baskets right in front of the chair that I was sitting on by the window

The lady walked away and when my 2nd dryer was just finishing she came back and moved my basket again to take the dryer underneath for a second time. I said something like.
""Ma'am, why are you moving my basket again when I'm about to take my clothes out?"" ""That basket doesn't belong to you it's not your property ""
She replied"" you don't control me. You can't tell me what to do. I wanna use this dryer.""

Then I said "" well you're being very rude. What gives you the right to mess with other people's property, especially when u could just use another dryer next to that one? 

Before I could finish she went to go get one of the workers who said that they technically have a right to use whatever dryer is empty. 

(The worker did apologize to me afterwards though.)
The lady then berated for being ""immature"" Which I responded by saying that she's twice my age and she should learn how to give others common courtesy and that she should have been taught not to mess with other people's stuff when she was as child.

After she finished with that dryer I got the rest of my clothes out and went to take them out to the car.

As I was leaving she was sitting in the chair that I was sitting in right next to my baskets.
And the way she was sitting she would have had to move those too.

I have a 5 yr old girl & 6 yr old boy that their son obviously plays with. A few weeks ago at a restaurant, their son wanted to sit next to my son. So he sat between me and my 6 yr old.

My oldest is 15 and he was diagnosed with ADHD when he was 8. We went through so much between IEP's, evaluations, etc. and I guess I kinda feel like I've ""been there, done that"" and now I'm done. At this point in my life, I don't feel like telling a toddler over and over to ""sit down"" ""behave"" ""don't throw that"" My little ones are relatively chill.

Don't get me wrong, I feel for Vicky but damn. 

So we are all attending a destination wedding in July. Vicky & Joe are planning to take their son. I know if we take our kids, we would end up watching him and I do NOT want that. It would go the same way it always does: her son wants to play with my son so she let's him to come to me and BAM! I'm watching her kid for the rest of the night. 
She's been asking me if we're taking the kids to the wedding (which is out of the country) but I'm avoiding giving her a concrete answer. 
The a-hole in me wants to let her think we're taking them so she takes her son and has no choice but to tend to him while my husband and I enjoy our first night(s) out in 4 years.

AITA for making in clear that I don't like some one?,"So this all happend today during first period, two Dudes were all giggly and stuff Like that. Suddenly I saw a paper flew by and I picked it up and told my friend to read it because I had a Bad vibe about that paper...
Straight forward it was a Love letter that was wrote from, lets call him James, for the other Guy (we'll call him Tom), for me.
So Tom is quite the nice guy, he is tall and has brown hair but always trys to be funny. I don't really like him, cause when he turns aggressiv he pinches or hits your arm. I did in fact got bruises from that.
I ripped the paper without them noticing and threw it in the trash. James noticed it and asked for my answer, I made clear that I didn't like Tom but I knew it was a joke so I kind of went with it. 
But my problem was; whenever another boy would pass by them Tom would go Like: Ey, did you know that OP is my girlfriend now?
I of course said that that's not true and he should shut up. 
Braiden (Fake Name) an other Boy from my class saw me holding a piece of paper, I just scribbeld some notes on there, and went Like: HEY OP! IS THAT THE LOVE LETTER FROM TOM?! 
I was emberresd, everybody stared at me! Even the teacher went in on it an people told me to read it, I told them it's just a piece of paper and I threw it in the trash as well.
Later I found out I was not the only girl that got a Letter from ""him"". Marlene (Fake Name) also got one and argued with him and Tom apparently said that he likes me more than her... I was uncomfortable with everything but still brushed it off nicely. 
But during lessons he would say my name and give me weird looks.
In our last classes whe had that kind of teacher who didn't Care about anything, so he let us just do what we wanted to. Ben (Fake Name) build in paper airplane and it flew right between my back and my Chair, he just came over and took it back, he didn't ask me to give it to him so he just grabed it and for viewers it looked wierd. My friend went Like: looks like you and Tom have time to go to therapy now! 
As a Joke, obviosly, but Tom took it serious! He wouldn't stop talking and after class he and my ACTUAL Crush teased me and asked me when the therapy is going to start. I ran down the stairs hoping they wouldn't Catch up, but they did and scared me.

At that Point I lost it at them and just went on about a full on rant! I told Tom I would never love him cause he is an annoying A-hole and that he Made me feel uncomfortable this whole day. I told him to not talk to me for tomorrow and that he should think about a really good apology.
He laughed and told me it was an obvious Joke, but I didn't care. He even texted me saying it's my fault cause I went with it and that I'm to damn ugly that anyone would ever Love me. I didn't respond.
Even my friends said I was to harsh.
I honestly don't know what to do an if I really was the A-hole here, so am I the A-hole?

AITA for getting mad at my Orthodontist,"Very quick story 
I (16M) have had braces now for 4 years (Covid and other related issues) and throughout that time my orthodontist has been very nasty towards me and lied about how long I have left on my treatment 

Today I went and he commented on my brushing being poor. Ik i haven’t been doing it as often as I should but I haven’t been in the right shape mentally and it slips my mind sometimes to go and brush my teeth. I tried to explain this to him and said I would improve but he laughed and this and started making nasty remarks about how I don’t forget to get changed or open my eyes in the morning and I couldn’t take it much longer and snapped at him. I said “I came to have a brace checked and not to be made to be an idiot’ ‘ I have had a rough past few weeks with various family and friend issues combined with the pressure of school’ He didn’t say anything and did what he needed to do. As I was leaving he muttered to keep the same time for my next appointment. At this point I began to wonder if I was maybe the a-hole and it hasn’t sat right with me all day so AITA?
Edit:I feel i look like I can’t take criticism and so that’s why I think I may have been an a-hole

AITAH for wanting to speak to my old Classmate?,"EDIT: Sorry, I meant the title to be : AITAH for NOT wanting to speak to my old Classmate

Okay to start the whole story we have to start right at the beginning of last school year. It was my Senior year and we started planing our graduation in one of the first weeks of that school year. Planing took us about 3/4 of our senior year, everything had to be perfect for us, because we were the first class who was able to have a big graduation since covid hit. So we had this whole thing planned out and then on our last meeting we decided what to gift our teachers and who would get a present. My Classmate (MC for short) wanted to gift all of our teachers something, so she bought all of them a plant.

The last week of school, we had no classes but haven't had graduated yet, comes around and my class went to Italy, I stayed at home for some Personal reasons and MC said she would organize a gift for our Classteacher for the last three years. My friend and I were already pissed of by MC because she just went to Italy and left all the rest of planing on us and we also had to organize a present for my English teacher. I bought her a book in the end and no one knew of it, so that should not matter in this case.

Then the day of the graduation rolls around and I call MC for the last bit of information and coordination for the Presents. I asked her if we had all presents, if every teacher had one. She said no. At this point I was pissed. I had spend the whole night handcrafting 12 cards for the teachers. I had like two hours of sleep, no real time to get ready and was stressed out, due to the fact that my mom was tested positive the day prier. I asked her what present was missing, when she dropped the bomb. It was the present for our Class teacher. So I spent two hours and 25 bugs on the day of my graduation to fix her mistake. In the end I had one hour to get ready, because they needed help setting the whole thing up. MC said she would be there too, in the end she showed up 20 mins before the whole event started. My Friend and I were pissed. We both had so much work MC said she would do.

After I left the Party, she called me. It's now nearly four months later and I still was not able to listen to her voice mail, due to the fact that im still angry at her.

WIBTA if I ask my roommates bf to wash his hands after using our bathroom,"I live with 3 roommates, we are all early 20s F, and we only have 1 bathroom, it’s a small apartment. My one roommate’s bf stays over 1 or 2 days a week which is fine but he does not wash his hands after using the bathroom!

I only know this because my bedroom door is close to the bathroom and I hear him slam the toilet seat down and the door immediately open, so I KNOW he does not wash his hands ever. There have also been multiple occasions where he didn’t even flush (10+ in the last few months)…. My other roommate with a door close to the bathroom also noticed the no hand washing .

I think I could be the a-hole for bringing this up because it’s not really my business of what someone does in the bathroom and it feels intrusive that I even know this (trust me I wish I didn’t) but I can’t get over the idea of him touching the bathroom door handle, and everything else in our house with his bathroom hands! 

My roommate is also pretty sensitive about any criticism towards her bf and knows I don’t like him (unrelated reasons) so I feel like she might just think I’m out of line and knit picking.

So WIBTA if I asked my roommate to tell her bf to wash his hands and flushes the toilet or just tell him directly… especially the flushing part…",Not the A-hole
AITA for being a picky eater and rejecting my granny’s world-famous liver and onions dish?,"Okay, fellow Redditors, let me set the stage for you. I visit my granny, and she wants to cook me something special. I’m like, sweet, bring on the feast! But then she drops the bombshell: she’s preparing liver and onions for me. Now, y’all, I’m a picky eater. I can’t handle stuff that tastes weird or looks unappetizing. And liver and onions? No offense to my granny, but that’s a hard pass.

So, I politely tell her that I’m not a fan of liver and onions and ask if she can cook something else. But she’s all like, “But honey, this is my signature dish! It’s been a family tradition for generations! Everyone loves it!” Now, here’s where things get awkward. I’m not everyone. I’m me. And I don’t love liver and onions.

I try to explain to her that it’s nothing personal, and I’m grateful for her cooking for me, but she’s not having it. She accuses me of being ungrateful and disrespectful and wasting perfectly good food. She even starts crying, and I’m like, great, now I’ve made my granny cry. This is not how I wanted my visit to go.

But here’s the thing, Reddit. Am I really the a**hole for rejecting a dish that I don’t like? Should I force myself to eat something that I find revolting just to spare her feelings? Shouldn’t she be the one accommodating my dietary preferences instead of guilt-tripping me?

I don’t know, but I do know that I ended up eating a bowl of cereal for dinner that night while my granny sulked in her room. And that, my friends, is the sad tale of my picky eating habits. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for thinking friend is shallow? He hates his gf for putting on weight.,"TL,DR:  Best friend considering dumping his awesome long term gf because she's put on a little bit of weight.


My best friend has been a serial dater of skinny girls. The skinnier and more damaged, the more eagerly he chased them. Very few of them were nice people. I despaired at every new girl he showed off - I could see from miles off how many of them were mean. Each one ended in them showing their cruel natures, or becoming crazy ex girlfriend break up stories. It was like he couldn't stand to be alone, and kept picking the same types: ultra skinny and unhinged. 

I hooked those dark days were over. He got his act together and found a wonderful girl 4 years ago. When they got together, I was so surprised - she weighed more than a stick insect!! She was a little bit chubby, but it suited her. But it's her personality that's the winner. She's cute, clever, funny, earns considerably more than him and gets on really well with his family. (That's a first!) He's been totally accepted by her family, too. He's been so calm and happy these last few years. She has been so kind, supportive and good for him. 

But recently she got a new stressful job, and he moans that she's been snacking and living on the sofa. I too noticed she was heavier. But she's not huge? I'd still only call her chubby. Because she's short she's rounding out like a hobbit. That fat ain't gonna stretch out on her little limbs. That's life. That's my life, too. (But I don't swing towards the ladies)

He complains she won't exercise and that he feels sick/ embarrassed at being seen with her, and is losing bedroom interest in her. He said to me in confidence that he'll dump her if she gets bigger.

I pointed out that if they had kids, she'd definitely get MUCH bigger and after the kids, would likely get the permanent mom-pillow on her belly. He exploded at me, how dare I suggest he didn't know that and would want her to be skinny if she was pregnant. Went on about me taking this personally because I'm overweight. 

I had to apologise to keep the peace and what at the time felt like save the friendship, because he was so, so angry. I was shocked. I haven't seen that mean angry side of him for years... coincidentally, just over 4 years.

Am I the a-hole for thinking he's shallow, and that he's completely missed the point of having a partner?",Not the A-hole
AITA for walking out on my father's house at christmas,"Hi I've been a lurker for a while but never posted and have been stewing on this for a few months now.

So for a bit of back story my parents separated we'll over a decade ago, it was a toxic relationship which I repeated for some time in my own love life and don't hold that against them at all.

My father and mother are remarried and seem happy. I tend to split Christmases between the parents  afternoon and evening, with morning for just me and my children. This allows my children to visit both sides.
This year I went to my mother for dinner and told my father I would be over afterwards. 
All was well all day until I went to my fathers to find my stepmother and stepsister (whom has recently moved back at the age of 30 after dating yet another drug addiction muppet) very drunk (sadly a norm for the pair as they do clearly have a problem).

I decided I'd stay for an hour just so the children can say hi and talk to my father. We played games chatted and all was well up until I stepsister noticed my son had an earbud in listening to music. 

Now my son like myself has rather bad ADHD and find listening to music in one ear quietens the brain and he was being engaging throughout anyway so no issue. 
I realised my stepsister of this as I have done numerous times but as normal her intoxicated brain refused this information and kept claiming it was rude and that she was going to snatch it out of his ear. I advised this was not the smartest idea as he would react and she would more than likely be hurt. This went back and forth for a few minutes and I was getting more and more annoyed and didn't want to ruin the mood any more so went out of the room to put some rubbish away and calm.

About 2 minutes later I hear my daughter shout for me so come running back in to see my stepmother grabbing my sons arms while my stepsister records everything on her mobile whilst laughing. My son looks terrified and I shout at my stepmother to get off him and get away. I then shout at my stepsister to delete the video before I take her phone off her and snap it in half. 
They shout they weren't doing anything wrong and I just make sure it's been deleted and leave.
Now I'm being told by people I overreacted and shouldn't have left but my children were very shook up and no longer want to see them. So am I the a-hole.

When my mom got home a few minutes later I told her what happened and she also got mad at me for not making it. She then had me make the bed with her, once we were done she asked if it was so hard to do what my father had asked. 

At this point I was pissed. Excuse me if I’m wrong, but I don’t remember him ever asking me to make the bed. I would also like to say that it has never been my responsibility to make anyone’s bed. So what do you guys think? Am I the A-hole in this?",Not the A-hole
AITA for calling my in-laws names?,"Today, I was running errands with our daughter who is 18 month old. I had a bunch of returns at five different stores and I had to get groceries at the end. I thought it’ll be fine she typically does great at the store. (I ran errands to 3 different stores with her before she did fine.) By the time we got to shops 4 and 5 she was restless and wanted out of the shopping cart. She kept getting away from me wanting to play and look at the dolls. We Checked out then headed to the grocery store, I was so exhausted, I was looking forward to getting home and relaxing on the couch before making dinner.

On my drive home, I ask my husband to pull out the ground beef for tonights dinner. He replies yes, and he adds my sisters (my sils) are stopping by in a few hours to play with their niece since they haven’t her in a while. I’m like thats fine. In my head, I like there goes my relaxing time. 

I get home so exhausted from running errands for the last 3 hours. When I pull up, my husband helps me unload the car and says btw my sisters are here and I invited them to stay for dinner. In my head, I’m like great now I have to host dinner. 
I walked we greeted one another, my daughter happened to fall asleep in car and stayed asleep when my husband got her out of the car.  So my sils were were sitting on the couch on their phones. I begin putting the groceries away, then my husband asked if I needed any help with making dinner. I sarcastically say; yeah, if the plan is to eat tonight. Anyways I’m in the kitchen quickly putting dinner together. He helps me by putting away the rest of the groceries and puts a pot of water on the stove for the pasta and slices up the french bread. While, I’m quickly chopping up the ingredients our spaghetti sauce. Finally, everything is cooked, I set the table and invite them to eat. 

They get up sit at the table, put food and one sisters says very monotone “thanks for the food”. I’m like yeah no problem. 

Dinner is done, they grab their plates place them in a very full sink and sit back down on the couch. In my head, I sacrifice my relax time, worked tirelessly to put this together and they didn’t even bother asking if I needed help with the dishes or the clean-up. 

My husband joins them on the couch and grabs my daughter. All three of them are playing with my daughter with the new doll house I bought, while I’m in the kitchen cleaning up after dinner. I’m so pissed but I kept it together. 

Then when they leave, I try to calmly tell my husband what they did was so rude and disrespectful. We start arguing. He tells me I need to grow up And that they didn’t do anything disrespectful or rude. He said, if I needed help in the kitchen I should’ve asked. In my mind, how do I ask 23 and 25 year old adults for help.

I could have gone to school where he was but my parents lived an hour away and he is not reliable.

AITA for leaving wedding early?,"A very good friend of mine from university got married today. She lives in England and I live in Scotland. Arrivals were from 12:30, and the ceremony began slightly late at 1:45. I arrived for 12:30 and left at around 4:30pm, after the meal’s first course.

I had already agreed with my friend I was going to leave the wedding early (I originally mentioned around 5:30-6), but with the recent airport chaos I decided to get to the airport earlier than planned, so I could (hopefully—on my way there now) collect my suitcase which had been delayed on my previous flight coming to England.

I feel really bad for leaving the event so early (most people were still eating!) and a woman sitting at my table even chastised me (possibly half-jokingly) saying, “Not well planned, have you?”

Am I the asshole for leaving my friend’s wedding so early? There could’ve been the possibility to sleep near the wedding, but I attended another wedding a week ago (in another country), and with gifts for both weddings, flights, as well as the hotel in between (I planned it so I could have my holidays in between the weddings) it would’ve been too expensive to spend another £150 for a further night away.

AITA for not inviting my sister to my wedding,"My bestfriend (21F) and I have been bestfriends since kindergarten. Despite us meeting first, and the age difference, my sister(24F) and my bestfriend also got along great. We were like a trio for many years and my sister often joked we were her two annoying little sisters. Whenever we would meet new people my sister would always introduce my bestfriend as her sis, and sometimes people didn't realize for months we weren't actually related.

Last year my bestfriends boyfriend broke up with her. He told her that he had feelings for someone else and couldn't pretend like he didn't for any longer. My bestfriend and her bf had been dating since the seventh grade and she honestly thought she was going to marry this guy.

When my family found out they were all mad for her and said the guy wasn't worth her anyway. That was until they found out the ""someone else"" was my sister and that she liked him back. After that they all quickly changed their tune and acted as if the situation couldn't be helped and stopped backing up my bsf.

I on the other hand did not change sides. I was in disbelief that my sister could do this to someone she referred to as family for years. Not only that but she did this despite knowing and could change the relationship dynamic of my bestfriend and I since kindergarten. Not only did she have no regard of their friendship but also mine, and the relationship between my sister and me ourselves. She chose a guy over all of that. And if she did that to her other ""little sister"" what proves she wouldn't do the same to me?

I told her that if she chose him, this might cause a strain in our relationship that was irreparable. She must have thought that I didn’t mean it. For the past year our relationship has been distant despite us growing up so close. 

When I got engaged my fiance told me that I would have to choose between my sister and bestfriend. My fiance had told my bestfriend that she was planning to propose to me, when my bsf heard this, she told my fiance that she wouldn't be able to stomach seeing my sister and her ex together at the wedding. She told her that she didn't want to give me an ultimatum but that for her mental she couldn't go if my sister was attending.

I took a week milling it over and I chose my bsf. My fiance told me after I made my descion that she also agreed I should choose my bsf over my sister. 

My family was livid. They said my bsf was not my sister and I should choose my ""real"" sister. And that she's not a real friend for making me choose. They said since it's been a year she should be over it already and that I would be the A-hole to not invite my sister.

"AITA for not going to my sister's ""child-free"" wedding?","My sister is getting married next month to my best friend. She always wanted a nice snow wedding in the cabins we used to go to when we were in school. Everything was going fine until she told me it was a child free wedding. Now, that would be fine with my wife and I because we would just drop of my son and daughter at my wife's parents or with their godparents, but my sister had asked them to be the ring bearer and the flower girl. Apparently, they want the kids to perform their duties at the wedding but then not attend the reception. That means either my wife or I will have to be there with them alone in the cabin while everyone is ""partying it up"", but wait, I'm the best man and will be conducting the reception so it's just going to be my wife. What about food? My mom will give my wife 20 minutes to come in, grab some plates with food and come back because the mother of the bride can't be missing for too long. 

So, they expect me to abandon my wife with our kids who are under the age of 7 in a tiny cabin that is not child proof, where the source of heat is a fireplace and there is barely any cell signal. This is the day after driving for 7 hours with said kids. Not only do I think this is not a safe idea considering it would be the middle of winter, my wife has never been to these cabins and the lack of ability to properly communicate, but also, I think it's incredibly rude to invite someone to a destination wedding where they are only allowed to attend the wedding. Although my wife says she can manage (she's really gullible sometimes and is a little bit of a people pleaser), I refuse. She's not being treated like a guest but as the babysitter for the ring bearer and flower girl.

I tried to talk to my sister and the jack\*\*\* I call my best friend, who always preaches about being there for friends, loyalty and whatnot, but they are not conceding or willing to compromise. I asked if my kids could attend until the toasts, games and food then all four of us would retire to the cabin and let them party, no. If we could go completely child-free and leave the kids behind, no. If I just attend the wedding and retire to the cabin after the wedding, no. My sister is against all of these ideas while the jack\*\*\* has taken a temporary vow of silence. 

So, I'm pissed and said I'm not coming. Which in turn, began the messages and calls from everyone. My family, the groom's family and their/our friends. My wife has openly said that she can manage this, but I know that's to keep the peace. My kids are also upset because before asking us, my sister and jack\*\*\* asked them first to participate in the wedding and they were really excited because they're close with both of them. 

With all these calls and messages, I feel I'm going crazy and maybe I'm the a\*\*hole instead. So, AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for want to wear a suit instead of a dress,"Me (22F) never liked dresses at all, my parents tried sometimes making me like girls stuff but it was pointless and one they give up. I always thought that boys clothes was amazing and I am jealous a little bit but is because let's be honest they're clothes and styles are indeed cool, thankfully on these days thinks are changing now and girls can dress whatever we want but still, there's some occasion that makes me never participate like: Weddings.

And this brought to the title, my dad (43M) got invited to a wedding and me and my brother (10M) was invited too, in the invitation never said I should go wearing a dress but to be sure I asked the couple if was ok I going in a suit instead a dress to the wedding, they know me since I was a kid so they said as long I don't bring too much attention it was ok, so I go with my mom to make a suit for me and it was a perfect blue marine suit with a white tie and I love it.

Now my dad? His reaction when I appear in the wedding like that he was annoyed. He didn't said anything during the ceremony but in the party he make a speak (side note: he was drunk at this point) saying that the couple is luck and yadda yadda, but then he look at me and said ""and I hope you guys don't have a daughter, now days girls are not the same at was in our time"". Trust me everyone was silent no one laugh at all and I pretty sure he said directly to me and not as a joke.

Before that, my dad (more drunk then ever) said to my face that I'm a A-hole for not be what I born to be a girl and that I embarrassed him and if I don't act like a girl for my own good, then I can called him ""dad"" anymore. I just have enough for that night, I grab my brother and go home saying ""Don't worry Roger (that's his name) I never considered you my father anyway"" (To clear that him and my mom are divorced, he use me to know about my mom's life and he likes my brother then me and never cared about me at all).

He's still with his thoughts that I'm the A-hole and I should apologize for not be a girl and yadda yadda yadda, his friends who got married even get distance of him and hoping that he got therapy ASAP and all of this nightmare just because I wear a suit instead os a dress.

AITA for splitting the refund?,"Throwaway account because, let's be honest, no one wants one of these to come straight back to them.

My friend and I share a Prime account and recently both purchased the same set of headphones. My first pair did not work so I applied for a return and refund, and immediately ordered a new pair (because I'm impatient). I sent the broken pair back but for some reason, despite having confirmation of them being received, the refund was taking an age to come through. Then the return and refund disappeared completely off the order in question, so I got on to the chat to follow it up and ended up getting the refund manually put through. Now I was a happy chappy because I'd got working headphones and my refund.

I never concerned myself about the order still showing on our history because, like I said, I'd had my refund so all was good. However, a couple of weeks later, I get a notification that my return has been received and the refund is being processed. Odd I thought, so I checked the account and spotted that the returned headphones, that had finally been registered as being received back at Prime, had been logged against my friend's order, and they were being refunded the full value. Great I thought, I'll split the refund with them and we both get our headphones half price.

Now, knowing how tight they are, I knew if I told them what had happened (i.e. I had already had the refund put through manually) they would've been 'awesome, my headphones were free!' and wouldn't have even considered splitting the refund with me, so I just told them my return had been logged against their order and they said they would CashApp me the money once it appeared in their account. They let me know it had come through and I said 'just send me 50% of the refund'. They gladly obliged, without once querying why I only wanted half the money, and once they had done it I then told them the truth, that I had already had the refund and this was bonus money.

They immediately kicked off stating because it was against their order it should be their money entirely and not mine at all, and I should give them back the half 'I took'. I tried reasoning that the only reason their order was refunded at all was because I sent my first pair back, so I was trying to give us both the benefit of Prime's cock-up, but they were having none of it.

So, AITA for splitting the refund? I feel it was fair, because neither of us were expecting it, but they have made such a fuss I am now doubting myself.

To be clear I recognize I am the a$$hole in not telling Prime they shouldn't have refunded at all, and am 'probably' the a$$hole in not telling the truth before they CashApped me, so this is just about whether the refund should be split or they should have it all.",Not the A-hole
AITA I stood my ground? It felt terrifying and good!,"I’m in my 20’s living at home. I pay about $400 dollars in rent. My parent said $100 for every week making it $400 a month. I also pay for supplies for the house which I wasn’t supposed to pay for that cost well over $100. I clean the house everyday, do everyone’s dishes even though I have food allergies. Take care of Trash. I clean the fridge. I organize stuff for the house because my parent at home expects me to do it and is so lazy. My siblings don’t help clean up and just make more messes for me to clean. I don’t really have my own space. I’m supposed to get my siblings on the bus even though they are old enough and my parent blames me when they miss it. The month of March has 5 weeks. I don’t feel like I should have pay $500 for the month of March especially with everything I do for the household. My parent asked me about rent for the month of March. Asked me if I paid last week. I told them I didn’t the month has 5 weeks and we agreed on $400 a month. My parent was surprised I came up with that and said oh okay. I could hear the surprise and miffed tone if parent’s voice. For context my parent never has to ask me about rent because I always pay it on time. (As long as it’s before the next week, I pay every week unless there’s 5 weeks in a month.) My question is AITA for saying this to my parent? I stood my ground and it felt terrifying and good! 

Edit: I forgot to include that I had asked my parent about months with 5 weeks in them. On more than one occasion my parent did not answer. 

I might be the A hole because growing up talking back in any form even to explain yourself was frowned upon. 

TL;DR My question is AITA for saying this to my parent? I stood my ground it felt terrifying and good!",Not the A-hole
AITA for firmly enforcing my and my dog boundaries to my uncle in front of my parents’ friends?,"TLDR: My uncle scared my dog and then got mad at me for not letting him pull my scared dog to him by his leash.
Ok so a little bit of back story on my pup before I start. I (20m)have a cattle dog mix named Bear(1m) who is scared of new people. I am very clear and firm about how he is to be handled by me and other people because he is my service dog in training and if he has even a single bite on his records I won’t be able to make him my SD. Bear had only just met my uncle(55m) the day prior to the party my parents had
Okay now into what happened.
My parents had some friends over for a party and I was using it as a training opportunity for my pup. I had him on a leash. He was doing amazing even taking treats from and accepting pets from strangers. It was dark when my uncle came over to where I was sitting with my dog and accidentally spooked him. As I was getting bear calmed down my uncle was saying that Bear just needed to get his sent and then would calm down. He then asked the person sitting next to me to hand him Bear’s leash I said no and stood up to walk Bear over to him. 

My uncle tried to grab Bear’s leash so told him “don’t, just give him a moment to check you out” but he grabbed the leash regardless and then reached his hand out to try to pet Bear. That scared my dog because he wasn’t expecting my uncle to try to touch him so Bear tried to run away. Because my uncle had ahold of his leash Bear hit the end of the his line and my uncle started pulling him closer by his leash while Bear was still trying to get away. My response to this was to grab the leash on the other side of his hand and to firmly tell him to let go of the leash. I had to repeat myself 3 times to let go of the leash because he was trying to tell me that what he told me was okay (it wasn’t). Once I got him to let go I said that I wasn’t trying to be rude or mean and then tried to explain why what he was doing wasn’t okay. But he repeatedly interrupted angrily trying to defend what he was doing, and I wasn’t having it. I said “He’s my dog and I will reinforce his boundaries” and my uncle snapped and yelled “FINE!  Take your damn dog and go!” At that point I was pissed so I walked away. I remained calm during the whole interaction. 

When I get mad/frustrated at someone I always try to calmly explain why what they did wasn’t okay. I have this tone that I use when trying to communicate that that is calm and respectful but you can still hear the frustration in my voice.

The day after this whole thing went down my mom told me that I needed to apologize and that I was the a-hole for doing that in front of guests.
So… am I the a-hole?
Edit to add: I realize that cattle dog mix is not the best descriptor of my dog for his people fear 😅 he is a mix of a lot of different things he kinda has a cattle dog coat collar which is why I call him a cattle dog mix. He’s only 19.6% ACD. He also has like 6 other breeds and super mutt lol",Not the A-hole
AITA for leaving my friends?,"I'll give each of my friends the names Clara, James, Harry and Laura.

I left the group because of two events. The first was when James was talking about how he wished he could buy a binder, Laura tried to empathise by talking about a similar experience (she only briefly mentioned it) Harry and James then attacked Laura by saying that she was selfish and didn't understand they both just wouldn't stop even though Laura was in tears. I tried to step in gently saying that Laura didn't mean to make things about herself but the Harry and James didn't seem to understand and I'll admit that things got a bit heated and I ended up snapping a little that if they had a problem with what Laura said they should have just taken her aside and talked privately. After things cooled down both me and Laura apologised(they didn't)

The second reason was on new years eve a few months later, on the build up to this point we hadn't really met up much since the argument but we kept in touch on a group chat which me and Laura tried to keep going even though things were a little tense. However a couple of weeks before new years eve Laura's dog died and she hadn't been online much so Harry, James and Clara all decided to hop on the chat and text things like 'dead chat' which kinda hurt because me and Laura had been putting in effort, Laura then texted them saying that she knew they were joking but asked that they didn't do it again. On new years eve they again texted stuff like 'dead chat' which was the final straw and I left the group chat saying that I needed a break.

Before I left I told Laura I still wanted to stay in touch with her while I was taking a break from the group. After I left they all texted me separately asking why I left and I told Harry and James that I just needed a break while I texted Clara to clarify that she wasn't the reason for me leaving.

Turns out the three of them were having a new year's eve party without me or Laura which is why Clara then texted me saying that I was talking badly about James and Harry behind their backs and that I was trying to make her chose(I had not said that I wouldn't be friends with her if she stayed friends with them) when she texted this I apologised and clarifyed that I was not trying to get her to pick.

I started to feel bad about leaving however James then asked if I would be rejoining the group chat, I said no and it was like a switch flipped, James started saying that he hated me anyway among other nasty things(and a picture of the three of them flipping me off which was how I found out they were together) at this point I was shaking and sobbing when my mum came in the room, I explained everything to her and had a breakdown for a few hours before deciding to block the three of them. (me and Laura are still in touch she also blocked them after they started telling her how much of an a-hole I am)

AITA for wanting to go back home?,"My (36F) husband (37M) met in 2015 at a wedding in my city. He and his family live  about 8 hours away from my home town and they were just there for the wedding. (I’m Canadian and he’s from the US)
Long story short - we fell in love and got married around 2018. 
I had to go through a lot of immigration stuff and I couldn’t travel freely for a while. I really missed my family. But life goes on. 

During this wait period I got pregnant and had our first child (2019). It was during the last few months of pregnancy that I got my travel papers and could finally travel, but I couldn’t at that point due to pregnancy. After the baby we visited my family once or twice before Corona hit and every where was shut down. 

After the craziness of Corona finally eased, we visited my family in march 2022 for a FEW days - I think a long weekend. 

When we got back to the US, I found out 2 months later that I’m pregnant with twins and I all of a sudden became a high risk pregnancy. 

Again - we couldn’t travel for a while. 

We had our babies this fall. They have  gained good weight. They are good eaters and the pediatrician has no concerns. So now I’m trying to plan a trip to my hometown. I miss my family terribly and I want them to meet my twins. I also feel very sad and alone since the only adult I talk to now is my husband and sometimes his mom when she comes over to help 

This is where the issue starts-
My husband is saying I’m a horrible mother for subjecting my babies to a 8 hour drive (we would obviously take breaks) and that I’m putting them in harms way all for “15mins of fame” because I had “twins” and so I can “show them off” 
We would fly, but the babies don’t have their passports yet. 

He keeps telling me that they are gonna get sick and lose all the weight they gained. And keeps making me feel like crap. He has made me cry several times by calling me selfish and all other kinds of names.  

They will be a little over 4months olds during our trip. 
I’ve told him we can’t keep putting our life on hold. 
I miss my family and of course my family will be cautious around them - not being around them if they are sic, etc. 
He finally admitted that he doesn’t want to do the 8hr drive and that he will be miserable with my family. 
But he keepssaying the trip is unnecessary and I’m selfish. 
I made crazy sacrifices to be here with him -left my family, job and friends. 
I feel like me going back home shouldn’t even be up to him or his call. 
If I want us to go, we will go. It’s the least he can do for me.
All the holidays, thanksgivings and major events have been spent with what little family he has here. 

We are now not talking to each other and he’s extremely angry at me.
But I don’t feel like the a-hole, but I’m just wondering if I’m missing something and maybe I am?

I’d like to mention - the babies have barely been outside the house because he won’t allow it.  In these 4 months we have left only for doctor appointments, twice to his moms and once to target.",Not the A-hole
AITA for kicking my relative out of my house after they verbally abused my mom after my father's death?,"I am a 17 year old, from India. On August 2022, my dad suddenly passed away. He was very much fit and didn't have any health issues before, so him passing away on a sudden was unbelievable.I was devastated with the fact that he's no longer here. But I had to stay strong to support my mum.
Fast forward a few days...
All my relatives came to our house.(My father has 7 siblings). While having lunch, my aunt (father's cousin) suddenly started accusing my mother of being responsible for my father's death as she didn't care for him enough. 
My mom and dad had what you would call a perfect marriage.  I never saw them fight.  They had an amazing bond between them and they loved each other so dearly and they had been married for 36 years. I am their whole world. 
Actually my aunt doesn't like my mom because she was the one who convinced dad to adopt a child after facing issues of their own. Yeah, I was adopted as a 5 month old. So my aunt was particularly not happy about the fact.  When I was small, she tried to tell me in many ways that I am not my parents real child but I didn't understand that ofcourse and she also disliked the fact that I was practically my dad's princess , even after I am adopted. I don't see what the problem is in loving an adopted child.
So that day my aunt started accusing my mother of various false facts. Like - my mom and dad didn't have a good relationship. She never cared for him, and so as went to saying she's the reason my father is dead. I was furious with the scene I was witnessing. I immediately went over to her and saying her to stop but hissed back saying ""You don’t talk between us. You are adopted and not even real family..."". My mother sat in front of her crying profusely. I lost my total mind and shouted at her to leave my house and never come back. She told me that I wasn't eligible enough to kick her out of my father's house as she's his real cousin, again bringing the fact up that I was adopted.  I replied back that I didn't care what she thought but I was accepted by my parents and that's what I needed. I didn't need to be biologically related to my mom to protect her.
Later I was shouted at by some other relatives saying ""She's elder than you...you shouldn't have done that"" 
But what was I supposed to do. It was 10 days after my dad passed away. I couldn't stand someone making my mother cry. 
Did I do the right thing or wrong?

WIBTA if I said I will be the one to make the rules,"Background: a few months ago, I made a post about my ex in regards to him not wanting anything to do with our baby (I was 5mth pregnant) and if Iwbta for claiming child maintenance.

Now: a couple weeks ago, I get a Facebook message from his new gf asking why we split & when, eventually I tell her and she wasn't happy he abandoned his baby & they have it out (she never knew about it and he even tried denying all knowledge of the pregnancy. He has since contacted me saying he now wants contact (only cos his gf persuaded him to, not cos he wants too). He said he wants Wednesday's and for a whole day (not nights though) but doesn't wanna go on birth certificate, doesn't want to be present at birth or know of any appointments. Only to tell him when baby is born. 
My EDD is in 6 weeks & I have been planning to be a lone parent since February when he initially told me he didn't want the baby in his life. I told him that I don't feel comfortable him taking a newborn for a whole day, especially when I wanna breastfeed. He didn't like that & told me he'll have nothing to do with ""it"" then -- I told him the baby's sex & he still calls the baby ""it"". 

When the baby is born, I'm going to do him the common courtesy of telling him but would I be the a-hole if I tell him he doesn't get to dictate the visitation rules and setting some rules like not having his gf near the baby (they've only been together since March & I feel he would make it seem like he is number 1 Dad when we all know she's the one who told him to pull his finger out) and not taking the baby for a whole day?

Edit - I'm trying to reply to all comments but can't. My ex does know how to look after a baby as this will be his fourth child - he has 3 from a previous relationship. From when we were together, I saw that he was in fact an amazing father so can't fault him on that but I can fault him on how he has been treating our unborn baby",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I asked my upstairs neighbors to be more conscious of their noise level in the morning?,"WIBTA if I asked my upstairs neighbors to be more conscious of their noise level in the morning?

Ok I know I know.  To live in an apartment is to live with some noise, but hear me out. 

I moved into a new place about a month ago and the unit on the ground floor was the only one available at the time.  I couldn’t really wait for the upstairs one because I had to be out of last place.  On Saturday, a family of 3, parents and a high school aged daughter, moved into the upstairs unit (it’s a one bedroom).

It’s an older building and I definitely noticed that I could kind of hear them walking around especially in the kitchen but whatever it’s to be expected and not a big deal.  But then came Monday, and every morning so far I’ve been woken up around 5 am by really loud, what sounds like heavy footsteps from running around (it’s very fast paced) and some banging.  It’s basically shaking the whole ceiling above me.  

I know it’s not 100% just due to the quality of the building because I’ve talked to my next door neighbors on the ground floor and they said they don’t have any issues.  Also, the mom is home during the day, (I see her car) and I can again hear some light footsteps and creaky spots but it’s not a big deal.  

On Tuesday I bought some quality ear plugs and I’ve already been sleeping with a white noise machine and with both of them Im still being woken up at 5.  

I feel like I’ve done what I can to try to mitigate the noise to no avail, and I’m not expecting complete silence or anything.  I can’t live like this for a whole year.  I don’t think I’m being unreasonable but I might be for asking someone to walk differently in their own home.

AITA for wanting diamonds in my wedding band?,"My Fiance (M33) and i (F 32) have been dating for over 9 years. He proposed in fall of 2020, and we are getting married in 2 months. 
We designed my engagement ring together, as I had received the heirloom diamond from my mother (it belonged to her mother).  With my input, we designed the most beautiful ring- it's a .5 carat round brilliant, flanked with a small sapphire on either side,  with 5 smaller diamonds on either side that go about halfway down the ring. 

as we begin to look at wedding rings, i shared that i'd love to have a small diamond band to compliment my engagement ring. They can be small 1/10th or 1/15th of a carat even, wrapping around only half the band. 

My fiance said i don't need diamonds, that it's a waste of money, and that i should be happy with a small, plain, white gold wedding band. He said wanting diamonds was ridiculous and materialistic, and that since i want them, i don't care about what a wedding ring actually symbolizes. He also says wanting a diamond band means i think my engagement ring ""isnt good enough"". It's the most perfect ring and there's nothing wrong with my engagement ring- i just think a diamond band will compliment it so wonderfully.
While we ARE saving to buy our first home, we are pretty decent financially, although i make twice what he makes. I told him that since i wanted diamonds (and tiny ones at that) and i make more, that i am not expecting him to pay for my entire ring or any of it if he prefers (he paid for my engagement ring). While we will be sharing finances and have a fair split around who pays what, i thought it was reasonable to help pay for my wedding band because i did want something that wasn't plain. 

He's making me feel terrible for wanting diamonds, and personally it hurts when several of my friends have either 2 diamond wedding bands, or huge diamond bands because they say ""my husband wanted me to have the best, he said i deserve that"".  While it sounds silly or selfish, it hurts that i can't say the same thing. 

Am i the A-hole for wanting a diamond wedding band that i can afford? Am i the a-hole for not putting that money towards our home?

edit: i am not against lab grown diamonds at all, and we are forgoing a formal honeymoon. i also do NOT bring up the item about my friends when we discuss it- it's just why it stings me more.",Not the A-hole

AITA for refusing to humor a child with a fear of dogs?,"Yesterday I took my kids and dog to a public beach. (Dogs were allowed so I wasn’t breaking any rules.) The beach wasn’t deserted but it was sparsely populated, which allowed us to set up camp with maybe one hundred feet between us and the families on either side of us. Our dog is very friendly and, while he is well behaved and doesn’t jump, he will go up to strangers and greet them.

This was apparently a problem for one of the families next to us. The mother came up to me and told me her daughter had a paralyzing fear of dogs and asked us to move farther down the beach. I looked past her to see a girl who was maybe ten years old cowering behind a foldable chair, even though my dog was at least fifty feet away from her.

I told her no. I have two small children and I knew it would be a pain to pack everything up and corral them and the dog to the next spot. Plus, the kids were already heavily invested in an elaborate sand castle, and it seemed unfair to make them abandon their work. The woman called me rude for not moving and I suggested that if her child had such a bad fear of dogs, they should avoid public areas that allow dogs–there’s plenty of beaches in the area that either require dogs to be leashed or don’t allow them at all. She walked away in a huff and her family packed up their belongings and left.

When we got home, I detailed the day’s events to my husband. I expected him to laugh with me at the entitlement of the woman, but he told me I was also in the wrong. He said while the woman’s request was a bit much, I could have easily moved down the beach, especially since that family was there first. He also said it was a bit immature of me to not move. Does standing my ground make me the a\*\*hole?

EDIT 1: To clarify, dogs were allowed OFF LEASH at this beach. There are plenty of beaches close by that either require leashes or don't allow dogs at all.

EDIT 2: A lot of people are asking if my dog got closer to the kid, if he approached her, etc. I wasn't watching my dog like a hawk but from what I saw my dog never got more than twenty feet from the girl and didn't bark, jump, etc. He was mostly preoccupied with my own kids.",Not the A-hole
AITA for only buying food for my family?,"So my aunt has been staying at my home with me, my mom, and my brother for the past few weeks. Me and my mom work and have a shared understanding that if I am able/want to I can contribute to household expenses. I grocery shop often and put gas in the family car and sometimes I help with a small bill.

My aunt also has a job but to my knowledge isn't working while staying with us but she pays for her own things for the most part. Anytime I cook I make some for everyone who would like to eat. Recently my aunt asked if i could pick up some items for her at my job since I work in a grocery store and said she'd give me some cash for her items. I said yes but she never gave me the money so I didn't think about it until I started making a grocery list.

Now, whenever I shop I buy food mainly for me and my brother because he's a minor and my mom will add stuff because i Ask her to cook weekly meals or dinner some night, I still pay if it's just for us though. I didn't get paid as much as I thought I would this period and so I only got necessities I spent a little over $150 on food with minor snacks.

When my mom and I got home to carry groceries inside my aunt had this look on her face as she seen us carry in two fast food bags I bought tacos for my brother and sandwiches for me and my mom and snacks for the house. As I was stocking the pantry I made a joke about the chips and water bottles needing to last 2 weeks because I'm ""broke"" until then, I was mostly talking to my brother but made it a general statement because those items don't last long in our home.

My aunt's seemed to act distant, sitting on the couch staring at us all in the kitchen putting away food. Even when I said goodnight/ I love you to everyone she didn't acknowledge me. Now, I feel like the a-hole because I could've asked if she wanted food but when we left she had takeout and I was budgeting buying sale stuff and they didn't have the list of items she wanted on sale so I couldn't pay out of pocket for them. I also feel bad because my mom has been fussing about my aunt eating foods my brother eats and using supplies but not contributing anything while here, hell my mom kinda snapped on my when I called earlier to ask if she needed anything while I was at my job because I usually buy food but she needed help getting toilet paper.

I have to be honest most of my guilt comes from buying cheap snacks and fast food when I could have maybe saved up a little and went back another day to get my aunt some things but I still have to pay bills and get to work and she still spends her money on weed and takeout, also she can eat the groceries and meals my mom and I cook.
This could affect the tension in the house as my mom is already running thin with patience and if she notices my aunt's steely behavior it could cause conflict.

AITA for not wanting my Step-Dad to come to my graduation?," Background information: My (17F) Mom (43F) has known Larry (42M) since they were in middle school and have been on and off for years. My Mom was a single parent pretty much most of my childhood, not dating a guy for more than 10 months.

I hate Larry with a passion, he is a drunk, and has fallen on me once while drunk when I was 11 years old. As well as had some screaming fights with my Mom ending with them having sex while I slept on the floor.

When they had first gotten together in the beginning of 2021 I resisted it as much as I could which ended up with me getting grounded and screamed at by my Mom everyday until they got married in June of that same year. Them getting married caused a rift between my mom and I since I felt that she wasn’t validating my feelings. As well as her having him move into our home on my 16th birthday. So as you can imagine that day was more about them than me.

Since Larry moved here on weeknights and weekends my Mom would often go to the bar with him. He would be drunk more nights than not. Even though I have told my Mom it made me uncomfortable (I have past trauma with being around drunk people). Nothing has changed.

Now to the issue, I graduate from high school in 2023. We are already planning everything leading up to my graduation. Except for who's coming, at my school we are only allowed 10 tickets (One for each person), and I have a lot of people in my family that I want to come to my graduation since they helped in raising me.

Tonight my Mom and I were talking about who I want to invite to my graduation. She had said, “Me, Grammy (my grandmother), and Larry are definitely going.” I made a eh kind of sound and she said “Larry is going.” I then told her that I only see Larry as a roommate and that I have no relationship towards him besides the legal title “Step-Dad”. She kept arguing with me about it and saying that my step brother (who graduated in 2022) invited her so I have to do the same but with him. I said that it was my step brother's choice to invite her, and it’s my choice if I want to invite him. She kept going back and forth with me about it and ended up saying that he was going, end of story. I told her that it is still MY choice and walked out.

I may be the a-hole because not inviting him to my graduation will probably hurt his feelings, and make him feel left out.

AITA for refusing to “compromise” and causing tension between my family members?,"I’m on mobile, and English is my first language. Feel free to laugh at my grammatical errors and spelling mistakes

So I’m a trans man(M17), and it’s my senior year in high school. The graduation ceremony is in a literal day. I want to be referred to by my preferred name (for the sake of this, call me James), but it requires “parental permission”. I have been publicly referred to as such for the past ***2*** years. Teachers and peers alike all calling me James, ***no questions asked***. People just ***minding their own business***, as they should.

I want to be announced as James for the ceremony, but my parents refuse to give me permission, despite the fact that I have attended other ceremonies where I was referred to as such. My mother(F50) has isolated me from everyone, because of me wanting to feel comfortable in my own skin. All through high school all I heard was:

“Oh you want to wear what the boys wear for your yearbook photo, and have your ’fake name’ in it? Guess you wont be in the yearbook” ”Oh, you dont want to wear a dress for prom? Guess you cant go” I’ve been excluded from everything because of my mom because her, my dad(M57), and my brother (M19) care a lot about what others think. They expect me to “compromise.” In which the compromising is just shutting up and letting them deadname me. I refuse to let that happen. Call me a snowflake all you want, I‘m entitled to be referred to by my preferred name.

It isn’t like I’m going to come out to a large audience. It’s none of their business. I’ve had arguments over text with my dad and he stated, “We allowed you to use James at your college orientation, hair salon, dentist appointment. For graduation we wont allow it. You never compromise with us, we do so much and you are blind to it. Plug your ears so you dont hear the name that mom and me picked. We support you the best that we can, do you see that? We understand your illness, we are suffering along with you ever day”

They’re making as if I’m the a-hole in this situation, because I wont “compromise”, and now I’m “ruining the celebration” and how I’ve caused “unnecessary tension” in the house. They’re acting as if I’m the problem. So reddit, am I? (Any advice would be great, too)",Not the A-hole
AITA for not wanting to shop at a store ever again ?,"So my aunts sisters husband ( lets call him M) has a store and a had worked there for a year .
I was kinda skinny at that time and after a year i left for a better job . 
At the time i worked there i was already with my husband that M new , even after i left me and my husband would shop there .
Half a year after i left I gained a bit of weight do to working long shifts and night shifts ( i was working as an Attendant at the airport ) .

I froze and didn’t know how to answer , i felt humiliated and looked at my husband that was as shocked as me and we left .
He said it just a joke but i was crying at that point , i have an eating disorder and that triggered me so badly .
I said that i never wanted to go there again but my family is saying im the a hole for walking away and that im overreacting and i shouldn’t take it to heart .

AITA for bringing up a grudge in an argument with my parents?,"For some background I (16F) Live at home with my dad (49M), Mother (48F), and older brother (18M). I think I have good parents, but some of the things they do are rude or borderline hateful. My parents were born and raised in the deep south which may explain some behaviors.
 
Both of my parents hate admitting they’re wrong, or that they did something wrong. I could forget and get over this if they didn’t actively punish me (no internet, no phone, have to be in bed by 8, spanking, etc.) for disagreeing with them, even in a trivial spat (like if I’ll vacuum the carpets now or in 20 minutes
 
As I mentioned, being spanked is occasionally a punishment I get, but It’s a lot less frequent now that I’m older. Other than spanking and yelling, my parents haven’t been abusive in my opinion. The main reason I have a grudge against my parents that I brought up recently is because of a situation that happened when I was 15. I was on a walk with my dad, mom, and our small dog. While walking a car came in the direction I was in and my parents told me to move. I admit I misunderstood them and moved toward the car while holding my dog because I couldn’t see the car. Thankfully I moved away in time when I realized they meant move towards them, no one was hurt.
 
I turned to my parents, and my dad yelled “Stop looking at me like I’m a dumbass”. He then rushed up to me, roughly pulled me to the side of the road, and grabbed the front of my face, and held the back of my neck with the other. He was holding me with a tight grip, and then yelled at me for being incompetent. I’ve seen him angry before, but this was different, and I understand he was probably worried about me and our dog, but he responded with anger. I started crying, because he was scaring me by grabbing me, and because he was yelling at me, but he didn’t stop. My mom didn’t tell him to stop and just looked around while my dad yelled. Neither of them apologized for this, and we all just kind of pretended like it didn’t happen.
 
My parents seem a lot more on edge because my brother is moving out to college in a few weeks. Because they’re more on edge, they argue a lot more, which leads to me receiving a lot of punishments. The part where I might be the a-hole is during one of the recent arguments I brought up what happened. My parents said something along the lines of “why can’t you be a better kid?” I got extremely angry because I know I could probably be happier and more positive, but they as my caretakers and parents could be better too. Basically, I said “Why can’t you apologize for yelling and throwing me around.”
 
They’ve generally stopped talking to me unless it’s necessary, and now I feel as though I may have been too harsh for bringing up something that happened a while ago. I’ve been thinking about apologizing to them soon so we can go back to normal, but I want to know if I was an a-hole so that I can recognize the severity of what I said to my parent when I apologize.
 
AITA?",Not the A-hole
"AITA (26) M for not wanting my little cousin (17) M to come spend two weeks at my house this summer for ""vacation""?","Let me explain. So my little cousin lives about an hour away from me. Since he was a toddler he would always spend time at my house for weeks on end during holidays/summer. I am gonna be honest here, my cousin has a reputation of TERRIBLE behaviour. (for example, he ran up to my father and head butted him in the hip, 2 weeks after hip surgery when he was 4). As he got older his behaviour hasn't changed. My aunty (his mom) constantly calls me and complains about how rude, obnoxious, and inconsiderate he is all the time. I'll give a few main examples.

1. He shits and doesn't flush the toilet, regularly. He's done it at my house and its disgusting. His response every time is ""my bad, i forgot""
2. He is extremely greedy. He will eat a pound of wings to himself that is meant to be shared without any thought that people around him are supposed to have some. Again, he's done this at my house multiple times and its pretty frustrating after coming home from a long day of work
3. He is EXTREMELY LOUD when he plays video games. Loud to the point where the tenants who lived in his moms basement were forced to move out because they couldn't sleep at night. His response was that he didn't care.......he also does this at my house.
4. Most of the times he will only talk to you if it involves him getting something (food, a gift, a favour). Other than that he will be in his room.
5. He is extremely messy. He ate a plate of chicken at my house and literally left bones on the table. I walked in on him picking his nose and rubbing it on my bed (at 16 years old, not 6). Also, read my first point again.
6. He destroys my wallet. He has his own money but when he comes over he views it as all inclusive or some shit. Always wants to eat out, always needs a new hoodie, always needs to get some expensive objective finished (last year i took him to get his drivers license, and he failed the test)

If my cousin was well behaved, I would love to have him over all the time. Sadly it isn't like that though. It's to the point where I dread the idea of him coming here, and tbh it makes me pretty sad.

Now here is where it gets tricky for me. Recently his behaviour has been even worse, to the point where his mom asked him to go live with his father for a few weeks (they divorced 3 years ago). SO NOW that time is approaching for him to go back home with his mum, she calls me asking ""ohhh, can you please come and pick him up so that he can stay at your place for two weeks?? I feel bad for him""......BRUH feel bad for WHAT?? SHE KNOWSSSSSS THAT HE DOESN'T BEHAVE HERE AS WELL, HE NEVER HAS. So the question I have here is ----

AM I THE A-HOLE FOR NOT WANTING THIS ILL-MANNERED, TERRIBLY BEHAVED YOUNG MAN AT MY HOUSE FOR 2 WEEKS?

EDIT: HERE'S SOME EXTRA INFO THATS PROBABLY IMPORTANT. YES I live at home with my parents....PAYING MORTGAGE, PAYING BILLS, DOING GROCERIES, MAINTAINING THE HOUSE, DRIVING BOTH OF MY ELDERLY PARENTS TO AND FROM APPOINTMENTS (because I am the only one at home who drives).

AITA for asking everyone to help after dinner?,"After dinner my husband and kids walked out of the kitchen to watch tv while I did the dishes, took care of the trash from dinner, and emptied the garbage can. It wasn’t a lot of work but it seemed unfair to leave it all to one person when it could have been done faster with 4 people working on it.

I went into the family room and told everyone that they needed to help in the kitchen and make sure everything was done before they took off to relax so I wasn’t left doing the work alone.

My husband pulled me aside and said he wasn’t going to bow and ask for permission to leave the kitchen and that I shouldn’t talk to him like a child. He said if I needed help I should have asked for it. When I ask for help I get sighs, and huffs, and eye rolls. They should look around the kitchen to see what needs to be done and pitch in without my having to ask. And it makes sense to clean up the kitchen before leaving it to go to another room. He said everything he saw could be done later; if I want it done now that is my preference and that’s on me. He’s not going to help. He said I need to be more flexible and compromise. 

I was frustrated that I ended up doing the work alone while they got to put their feet up, so I probably wasn’t using the best tone when communicating. But am I the A-hole for telling them to make sure all the clean up is done before walking out?",Not the A-hole
AITA for Telling my Sister that she is Not an Adoptive Parent?,"I (34F) have 3 kids, 2 are adopted from China. 3 years ago we got matched we decided to announce it to the family at our Christmas party. When we said ""We're adopting"" the first words out of my sister's(now 32F) mouth were ""Me too"" I was very confused as she had never seemed interested in adoption so I asked her what she meant a few minutes later and she started telling me all about the new corgi she was getting.

I was kinda annoyed because I feel like it's weird to compare the adoption of pets to human children but I let it go at the time, fast forward about 7 months when we were home with the girls. They were 4 and 7 and the grieving process was very hard and it was just a difficult adjustment in general. When I tried to call my sister she kept comparing it to her dog(Which she had gotten a few months earlier). Like I would tell her some things that are triggering to my daughters and she would say ""Oh yeah, Howie had trouble with that on the first few days but we just kept exposing him to it and he got used to it"" (Howie is her dog)

First of all that is TERRIBLE advice and second she would say it like she was some experienced parent give advice to a new mother, she has a stepson but he was 11 when she met him and 13 when she became his stepmom(She has not adopted him and her and her husband choose for her not to be a parental figure for him) so I don't really think it's her place to be giving out parenting advice.

Well the last straw was that I go to a zoom adoptive parents support group and yesterday we had an event type thing where you could bring in a friend or someone who may be considering adoption and give them a little insight from the parents point of view. My sister asked me to invite her as she said she may adopt one day. I did and when they started talking about how sometimes in orphanages childrens hygiene aren't taken care of(AKA they don't have their teeth taken care of and often wear the same clothes for multiple says in a row) my sister started talking about how it was similar to how her dog was treated in the shelter and how annoying it was to have to take him to the vet for his teeth because they weren't properly cared for in the shelter.

Everyone in the meeting looked very uncomfortable, especially the women in charge who is an adoptee. After the meeting we were talking on the phone and I tried to tell her nicely that was an inappropriate thing to say when talking about inhumane conditions of actual children but she accused me of not caring about inhumane conditions of dog shelters. I said ""I do care about that but it's not the same as children. And adopting a dog from a shelter is not the same as adopting a child and doesn't make you an adoptive parent"" She hung up on me and blocked me on facebook. Did I say something wrong, am I the a-hole here?

Edit: I didn't ""Invite her"" specifically, I reposted the event to my facebook page and my sister messaged and asked me to invite her. And this was not a conversation type thing, it was a presentation put on by the group leader/agency rep so I didn't think she would have much time to talk and also I thought this would help her learn more about actual adoption and how different it is to animal adoption.

Edit 2: I do understand what it's like to have a dog and how their like a baby in some way(I have 4) but I still would never compare the adoption of my dogs vs the adoption of my daughters.",Not the A-hole
AITA for possibly calling CPS,So as a mom I have 3 kids oldest (12m) middle(step7m important to this story) and youngest(4f). Well my step son has come to me about some shady things his mom is doing his dad is deployed and I really don't have that much sway in the eyes of the law. His mom has recently  started  posting herself partying doing drugs and even drinking while she has her 4 kids. Now I want to step in and make it to where he is safe and feels safe and because we are so limited due to me not being a biological parent our lawyer suggests we call Cps and get them involved and start a paper trail to build a case. Now I have CPS I understand they have a job and it's a terrible one but my oldest dad is a vindictive guy who called CPS on everything. I'm on a first name base with 3 different CPS workers. They come do the inspections and close the case not a single thing has ever been proven. But my middle son misses a lot of school like we still have 6 weeks left and he has been absent/tardy 42 times this year. Would I be the a hole for calling CPS? And before you comment important facts that I know will be asked. 1) I have my middle every other weekend at least. I have him at most 20 days a month. Just depends on how his mom. As the courts only granted me 1 weekend a month and holiday time while his dad is deployed. 2) his dad has 50/50 physical and legal custody. 3) I didn't bring this up my middle has told me these things are happening unprompted. 4) when I have him he doesn't want to go home 5) the school has not filed anything with the state on truancy though I have notified the truancy office 6) I really don't like CPS and not cause they are bad people but cause I'm unsure if this is something they can verify. 7) I do know she has posted about doing pot and coke but unsure if she had the kids or if her mom did. 8) her mom asked me to take him but I would have to do it legally as I could face kidnapping charges.,Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to pay more than my flatmates for my bigger room?,"I (24F) had been sharing a flat with three of my friends for a year now. I have the biggest room out of the four of us because I have a big desk that I use for drawing (I finished university two years ago and I'm trying to find a job in an artistic related field. With no good results so far) and we've been sort of splitting rent equality for the past year (with me paying a tad more because of how big my room is). 
Today, one of my flatmates told me that they decided to increase my share of rent because I have the biggest room. This came to a surprise to me because, although we agreed that we were going to talk about splitting rent more equally soon, I had no idea that they already had that conversation without me. When I asked about where the decision had been coming from, she said they had already decided a while ago. I got mad because I had no idea that this talk had already happened, but apparently I ""wasn't around"" when the talk happened (aka, I was at work) and they figured out the numbers without asking if I was comfortable with that. 
I was ok with increasing my share before, but now I feel left out completely, like my opinion or situation doesn't even matter. I'm the youngest in the household, I make enough money to go by and the past few months have been kind of hard financially for me too. I don't want to be the a-hole in the situation, but I kinda feel taken advantage of, to be honest.


Edit: There has been an update! We had an emergency meeting to rework the details of the sharing of the rent. I brought up how their decision of not involving me in their previous discussion hurt me and they apologized for that. We decided unanimously a better way to split rent in a way that made everyone comfortable. We were all both wrong and right at the same time, so I guess happy ending, yay?

AITA for parking on the street in front of my house like I do every day.,"I (19F) live on a side street of a busy city with lots of close homes. Most of us have multiple cars as we are mostly adults or elders and not many have small kids. I work 9 hours a day 5 days a week and don’t spent my days off in the city. 

Today when I was at work we had put a second car in the back of the driveway, so it wouldn’t be on the street while the driver was out of town. We had one car still on the street so I could take that spot when I got home later. We moved the second car in the driveway and parked mine in the street spot. 2/4 cars were in the driveway that really only fits one comfortably.  

My neighbour’s daughter (30’sF) who doesn’t live there came running out yelling at me that we always park right in front of the house. She got really close yelling and swearing at me that when she visits she can’t park right out front, and that I should not be parking there because one of the older owners has difficulty walking.

AITA for telling my mom not to hug me or kiss me without consent?,"A little context: I'm (M🏳️‍⚧️) 17, turning 18 this October. My mom has some mental stuff going on that she won't talk about much but she's had severe depression in the past. Had maniac episodes. And has very narcissistic behaviour? (Idk I research a lot because of a genuine interest in psychology but I'm not a doctor and it's not diagnosis, I'm just giving context of what she's like) But her new meds should've been working. Also, I am autistic and have many issues with physical touch. [I've just edited to amplify something I didn't really touch on well in the original post, including why I thought it was relevant context]

Now, onto the events: my mom has always been a lot of a hugger. She really, really focuses on physical touch as one of her main love languages.
I don't, to me the best is simply Quality Time, or Info Dump, and Acts of Service. Because everything else either my anxiety won't believe it(words of affirmation) or makes me recoil in discomfort if I'm not the one initiating it(physical touch). I have made this clear with her, multiple times.
She says everytime she tries to hug me from the back, without consent, and it makes me lean away and feel uncomfortable that I'm being selfish, and that ""well, I am your mom and I need to hug and kiss my son sometimes"" and starts crying and what I'd call playing the victim. This has been happening since I was 14.
Then, since Christmas (now April 4th), she had moved in with her partner and I had been living alone with my grandma. And this was when we started thinking her new meds were really working finally. And things have been great
But, the house they were renting was a summer house, so she now moved back here, like two days ago.
Today, literally like 30 minutes ago, it happened again and I just had enough. I lashed onto her, saying to her again, in more explicit terms than ever, that it made me uncomfortable that she was touching and hugging me without my consent, because consentless touch made me uncomfortable. She, and my grandma, told me I was being insensitive and selfish because I wasn't understanding that a mother shouldn't need consent to hug or kiss her son. And I said that she was being the insensitive, selfish and frankly disrespectful one to refuse to hug her. They called me selfish and immature, again. And she even said she has been nothing but understanding and respectful of me(which isn't true she's been very objectifying and tokenizing of my gender identity and turning on on me whenever I did something she didn't like saying I used autism as an excuse). And told me that I should ""just get over it"" because it's my mom and I really shouldn't make a big deal out of it.

AITA for telling a volunteer that they can either serve LGBTQ children or leave the organization?,"This is a throwaway so it doesn't get traced back to our organization and make drama in our community.

I run a summer camp for a kids with a specific medical disorder.  I am the camp director.  Because of genetics, many of our community have familial relationships.  The organization is completely run by volunteers, including myself. I don't have the medical needs of the camp, but over the years of working in it, I've been accepted by the community.

This past year, one of our long-time campers (teenager) came out as bisexual. One of our volunteer cabin counselors, who has been with the organization since before I started working with the camp, has said that they don't feel comfortable with that, and has asked that this child not be placed in their cabin.

I told the volunteer that their job was to love, care for, and support the kids. If the child's bisexuality got in the way of it, then I wouldn't be needing them as a volunteer at camp at all.   I told them they didn't need to agree with every life decision the kids made, or even openly support the teen about their bisexuality--if they wanted to, they could just not say anything about it.  They're a volunteer and I can't police their beliefs.  But not only was it not reasonable for the counselor to make that request, but it made me question if they were suited to take care of and support any of the kids at all.  I need cabin counselors who love the campers unconditionally.

As a side note, our camp is so small in numbers that even if this person weren't the child's cabin counselor, they would interact with the child.

Other people in the organization told me that we need the volunteers and I was too harsh.  It wasn't that big of a deal to just put this counselor with a different cabin.  Yeah, we always need volunteers, but we need the right volunteers, and this makes me think they aren't the right volunteer. Some parents/former campers got wind of it (probably from the volunteer), and they have told me that this volunteer has been a part of the camp family for a long time, longer than me, and I overstepped my authority.   Did I overreact?  Am I on a power trip?

Now that I've heard the feedback, I'm wondering if maybe it was too much.  They've been a good counselor in the past. I think I might be the A-Hole because I was kind of giving an ultimatum that could be unreasonable.

If it matters: I have a Board of Directors over me, but I checked the bylaws, and they say that staffing decisions are the decision of the Camp Director alone.  The Board doesn't make any final decisions about how camp is run. If they disagree with me to an extreme, they can remove me from my position.  Some Board members have said they disagree with me, some say they don't, but all of them have stated that they don't think it's a big enough disagreement to remove me as camp director.",Not the A-hole

AITA for posting about what occurred over my birthday weekend?,"I (25F) got a call from my mother 3 days before my birthday, saying that the family had agreed to put down our family dog Sasha (an adorable pitty I've grown up with since I was 12) ON my birthday... I was immediately caught off guard and took the next day off of work, at my new job, to spend the day with Sasha. When I arrived, she was so excited - jumping up and down, trying to run around, and trying to play with me. I didn't see the pain they mentioned, so I asked what the vet said. I was told that they took her a few months ago when Sasha was a bit better but that she had rapidly declined since and they could ""tell"" that it was her time.

""A few months ago!?"" I said. ""Why wouldn't you take her the moment you thought she might need to be put down, for a professional opinion?""
I was made to feel like I was crazy for wanting a vet's opinion before they made a decision about a loved being's life. They argued with me all day, saying that I needed to accept it and that the decision has already been made. For hours, we argued until I finally got them to agree to letting me take Sasha, if I paid for it and if they let us walk-in when they open.

The next morning, I went into the vet and mentioned my brother's name (he's Sasha's caretaker). They grabbed his file and told me that the last time they saw Sasha was over a year ago for dental and that they'd be happy to setup a bed for her. I retrieved Sasha from the car and carried her in because her back legs are very weak, so she struggles to get up on her own. They saw her for a couple hours, did an x-ray, and then told me that Sasha has a fused spine that's making it hard to walk and giving her pain at times BUT, there were two meds that the vet wanted to prescribe that they thought would help. I asked directly if the vet thought that the meds were her best option or if it would be in Sasha's best interest to put her down. They said that putting her down ""wouldn't be [their] first option but that if we wanted to put her down, it is certainly /an/ option."" I bought the meds so that she could try them for a day or two.

The meds made most of her pain go away and gave her the ability to be more energetic. Though her leg strength wont recover, she can live happily for a while longer until the meds stop helping, at which point the vet suggests that we bring her back. My family agreed to cancel the euthanization appt.
Having told my boss and friends the reason for me taking the day off and canceling my birthday plans, people spent most of my birthday and the day after asking about Sasha and wondering how my birthday went, with her passing. I got tired of reiterating everything, so I made a Facebook post similar to this one, only shorter. My family saw it and got p*ssed. They cut me out over it, stating that posting what happened was disrespectful, made them look bad, and wasn't my business to tell anyone - that I am a selfish person who makes everything about herself to get sympathy.

AITA for telling my mother to stop?,"I (20 f) have moved away for university a few months ago. Ever since then, I've been looking for a job so I could make some spending money, but haven't been able to find one yet. I am currently finishing my exams and planning to get a job over the summer. My mother (50 f) is absolutely against it, saying that I should come home and not do anything. In fact I wouldn't not do anything, as every time I come home I am expected to do something just because I am a girl and girls apparently are supposed to do work, while my older brother (30 m) doesn't have to move a finger. Whenever he is home, he gets breakfast made with coffee every morning while I have to cook for myself. I know for a fact she would expect me to do everything around the house because that is how the situation was before I left. I cleaned, I did laundry, everything. I also have to mention that my family's financial situation is really bad right now and I just want to take a burden off. Today I finally snapped. She called me and asked me to come home. I got really angry and told her to drop the subject. I previously told her that I really want my own money. I want to buy myself some clothes and shoes as I have been wearing the same clothes for like 3 years now and I don't ask her for money because I know the situation and I don't want to add to it. The only money I ask for is the dorm fee and Internet, which is not a lot and I could cover myself if I would get a job. She hasn't texted me or called me after I told her to stop insisting. She just said okay and ended the call. I have needs, I am a young woman after all, I have been avoiding asking for money for new stuff all the time, I just wanted to make it easier for her. I didn't even yell, just raised my voice a bit and told her to drop it. She isn't a bad mother, but her favoritism over my brother is clear and she clearly resents me for rebelling and making my own choices (she hates my university). My father is neutral, he hasn't told me anything to get a job or not, but both mom and brother are against it.

AITA For Not Moving When my Roommate is Allergic to my Cat,"Hello everyone,

I am particularly distraught to be asking strangers on the internet. I’ve spoke to everyone around me, but worry they’re just siding with me because they know me.

For context, I’ve had my cat since I moved in and was very clear to my roommates, and they were okay with it. Signed the lease and cat papers, but it turns out one roomie has severe cat allergies, but really wanted a cat in the home anyway. It’s now ten months later and she wants me off the lease. I’ve done everything from moving all cat supplies into my room, and deeply vacuuming the whole house every week to no avail.

I wish I could do this for my roommate because she is also chronically ill, and moving would be hard for her. But I just got out of homelessness, and I think the stress would break me. I explained my situation and told her I can’t move for her but can get her some manpower. She won’t accept it, and suggested to get rid of the cat. The lil dude (cat) is for my PTSD. 

I renewed my lease today anyway because the fear consumed me, but feel guilty. I keep trying to explain to her what I can and can’t do, but she avoids me. Am I the A-hole?",Not the A-hole
AITA for causing a rift in the family?,"
Strap in, it’s a long one. Names changed for privacy, etc… My husband (Connor)  and I have been married for almost 12 years now and for most of this time his identical twin brother (Ken) has been with the mother of his two kids. Let’s call her Tess. Tess and I had an intense friendship - in that we were the best of friends but also had a good few disagreements over the years. Ken has never really liked me for various reasons, but he tolerated me. Two years ago Ken found out that Tess was cheating on him. It was a messy break up with DV involved. Tess kind of went off the deep end into drugs and alcohol and everyone suffered. At first I tried to stay in contact with her because I knew she didn’t have many supports in her life, but it got too much for me when I had to call emergency services because she was threatening to end things. Anyway over the next year and a half Ken tried to keep things civil with Tess and share custody of the kids, etc… before splitting Ken and Tess had been building a house and when they split Tess said Ken could have it because he put most of the money towards it, so Ken was terrified that she would change her mind if he upset her. 
So Easter this year I heard that Tess had been in a bad car accident because she drove drunk. She had fractured her back. I asked Ken if he minded if I called the hospital where she was because I just had a really bad feeling. He said go ahead she isn’t taking any of my calls. So I called and she answered and she was so broken. She was on rock bottom. I put aside any prejudices and hard feelings and supported her because she had literally no one else. She recovered and found a stable place to live, got a job, and started AODs - she has been sober since the accident! But obviously this caused a huge amount of tension between Ken and us. He decided to file for divorce. He expected me to feed him information about Tess to support his case and when I didn’t I was a backstabber. I mentioned to Tess that one time when we had visited Ken his girlfriend had finished a whole bottle of alcohol in the course of one day and unbeknownst to me Tess mentioned that to Ken and so he got very angry at us for telling her things. The only other instance this happened was when I told Tess that Ken could still see her internet browsing history from a joint tablet he still had. After that Ken blew up at Connor about it saying we were backstabbing him and had ‘switched sides’ etc… He couldn’t understand that I believed the children deserved both parents in their lives and I wouldn’t sabotage either side. So he cut us both completely out of his life. Blocked on all social media, no contact whatsoever. It’s been almost 4 months now and I know Connor is really feeling the loss not having that contact with his brother. Am I the a-hole in this situation for causing all of this to happen???

TL:DR - brother-in-law cut twin brother out of his life because wife is talking to ex-sister-in-law.",Not the A-hole
AITA for How I Reacted to My Parents Behavior on my Birthday?,"Hello Everyone.

Sorry if formatting is bad. I'm on my phone.

Today is my 19th birthday. My mom said we would go out to eat today and I thought that sounded nice. 

As we were about to leave my mom said to my dad ""Are you going to wear your boots to the restaurant?"" in a slightly annoyed tone of voice.

Now this is not a fancy restaurant at all. I wore workout type clothes and sneakers. My dad was wearing work boots. They don't look bad or anything. I didn't understand why my mom didn't like the idea of him wearing them. My dad said yeah he's going to and my mom proceeded to say things like, 

""I just don't get why you'd want to"" and then said ""fine if they make you happy it's okay."" 

By that point, though, my dad had gotten annoyed and just changed his shoes. My mom then said

""Are you going to wear your undershirt too?"" (It's just a black t-shirt) and ""Its got dust on it. You at least need to change into a fresh shirt.""

We then left for the restaurant and when my dad parked she made a show out of opening her door as little as she could when getting out so she didn't ""hit the car next to us."" There was plenty of space.

At the restaurant she got upset because my dad finished his food before us. He stood up in the restaurant and just stared at us as we were trying to finish our food which made me and my mom feel rushed. He then said loudly that he needed to find the bathroom and walked away. This made a lot of people look in our direction.

When we got home my dad found a package on our porch and my mom said 

""What did you buy now?"" and my dad got upset saying it was a package that he shipped that got sent back and that he was ""f-ing sick of dealing with his packages being sent back.""

My mom then said it was his own dumb fault and that he knows it upsets him. He then said that he wouldn't do it again and she said 

""You always say you won't but then you do it again and get angry."" At this point my dad stormed off into another room.

Now this is where I think I might be the a-hole. I went to my mom and said 

""Can that please be the end of you guys fighting today?""

She said she didn't know what I meant and I reminded her of everything I wrote above. She said that that wasn't fighting and I have no idea what it looks like when people actually fight. She then said 

""I tried to give you a nice birthday. I spent $40 on food for us. I asked you about work and the dentist. Everything has been about you today.""

I went upstairs where I am right now and heard my mom tell my dad ""apparently she thinks we're fighting and we ruined her birthday. I guess I'm just a huge bitch. I tried to make this day nice for her but apparently I can't ever do anything right.""

My dad was upset and when he came to talk to me I said the same thing to him. He said I was being ridiculous and they weren't angry at each other.

Now I feel bad because I think maybe I'm being too sensitive and spoiled the  mood.

So AITA for how I reacted to my parents?",Not the A-hole
AITA For still remembering something that happen over a year ago?,"I am a scripter for video games. I also do some freelance projects. I actually did a few with the person I'm talking about. But it all changed when I asked for a higher position because I felt like I was doing the most, he said I cannot because he did not ask me to do the most. He also says that he was away from his computer for a long time so I can't blame him for that. I did not blame him for that. To salvage our friendship I decided to just leave the team all together. Now welcome to the present, we were talking and then he asked me if I want to work on the game with him mind you he has not updated the game ever since I left the development team over a year ago, I politely declined and when he asked why I explained what happen last year. He told me that I am being the A-hole for still being upset about it. I am not upset about it I just don't want to argue with him again. I also told him that I am currently doing some freelancing with some other people. And then he did a rant about business and how I know absolutely nothing about it. I told him that I was promised pay when the game is released. I ended up hanging up and asked him via text if we can move off the topic but he still wanted to talk about it so I just started ignoring him because I did not want to deal with him anymore. My cousin said I'm not the a-hole but I just want to make sure of that, thank you.",Not the A-hole
AITA for wanting to go to therapy,"I (13f) was diagnosed with autism around a year ago and my mum still doesn’t seem to realise how much I struggle (especially in social situations). She sort of assumes that because I’m ’high functioning’ then I don’t need much support.

The second thing is that I’m at the moment quite unsure about my sexuality, I just know that I do find other girls quite attractive but I don’t think I’m a lesbian. 

The third thing is that in my friend group, two of them (both of which have problems with mental health) have told me they were thinking of doing something that really scared me and that I’m not allowed to talk about on Reddit 

I don’t really have anyone to talk to about any of these things, and they are all on top of growing up and hormones and stuff. 

For that reason, I thought that maybe going to see a therapist would help with the situation.

I asked my mum if I could start to see a therapist, as I knew it had really helped one of my friends and I hoped it would help me (without talking about the things I discussed previously)

However, she said that it was expensive and I didn’t even need it anyway. She said that I should start being grateful for the life I have and that she doesn’t want to waste her hard earned money on the opportunity for me to ‘just complain about your perfectly fine life for an hour’ 

She then told me that I shouldn’t have even brought it up because I could just talk to her  - but that’s the problem, I can’t even tell her than I can’t talk to her. I can’t even talk to her about the fact that I’ve been having what my friend says are anxiety attacks (and that particular friend should know, she suffers from them herself)

I honestly don’t think I’m the a-hole in this situation but I do often think to myself that my problems aren’t good enough so my mum might be correct",Not the A-hole
AITA for not wanting my husband to visit his brother alone?,"So I 25f have been with my husband 27m for 9 years, married for 3 and have 2 kids together. However, his brother 30m 'L' and i have never really seen eye to eye. After my husband and i had our first born, L told my husband that he didn't think he was the father because she looked nothing like him. (we are a interracial couple, but she was born my mirror image). He just wanted to start s*** but never expected me to stand up to him. 

Fast forward to Oct before covid hit. L ended his relationship of 7 years and moved in with us, and in the same time we found out we were expecting again. He lived with us for 9 months before moving to a different city. 

Now it's been two years since L moved, and he is in a new relationship, with a wonderful woman. And there has been recent talks about going to visit him. But L's gf contacted my husband a week ago asking if he could come visit sooner than what we had planned and that he comes alone, implying the cost of accommodation for a family of 4 is expensive and it's better he comes alone. When we expressed that wouldn't be a problem, because we had included it in our budget, she remained adamant that he needs to come visit alone, with no explanation for why he can't bring his wife and children 

Now i feel like the a-hole because i don't want my husband to go alone because of my lack of trust in his brother, but L is the only family my husband has. 
L has made his views on his dislike for me clear on numerous occasions, but I feel like he is going to try some s*** if my husband goes alone. 

So AITA for not wanting my husband to visit his brother alone?


UPDATE!

So the trip has been cancelled, and BIL and I are not exactly on speaking terms and my husband is also not talking to his brother... 

There was a recent blow up between BIL and I, and he felt it the perfect time to speak his mind, where he was incredibly disrespectful towards me, (i wont repeat the horrible cruel words he used), not realizing his brother could hear everything he had said.

Oh, well. No love lost from my side... but one thing was made clear. He definitely had some kind of hidden agenda for wanting my husband to come down alone... Now, we are planning something different that the whole family can enjoy.",Not the A-hole
AITA for complaining about my housemates PDA?,"Background: My housemate (M32) and I (F34) have not been getting along since about halfway through my pregnancy. There's a few reasons I can try to attribute but the fact he is aggressively child-free is probably a big one. I still don't know why he agreed to move with us at the start of my pregnancy. He knew we'd been trying for 2 years. Since my daughter was born he's very rude about her. She's actually the easiest baby. She smiles laughs and coos infinitely more than she cries.

Around the same time he grew distant from my partner and I he became VERY into his new relationship (F23). Their PDA escalated and while I'm not a fan I didn't say anything until I kinda had to. All of us are part of a serious political organisation and they were doing it during meetings and activity. When I say doing it, I mean she's sat on his lap, they locking lips audibly so *smack* then ""mmm"" multiple times. Lots of touching, giggling etc.

Honestly I admit the sound is what started to really bug me and other people were commenting (to me) and a new member threw sweet wrappers at them one time trying to get them to cut it out. But only myself and my partner (M28) have called them out, privately and then twice in front of others. They've thus decided we're jealous. Like we're somehow incapable of being affectionate towards each other if we want to be. 

But other's in the group have said we shouldn't have called them out publicly because it was ""awkward."" I was Zooming into the meeting both times when my partner interrupted them. Baring in mind our housemate was supposed to be chairing the meeting. They were smooching on camera! They have a very ""I don't care"" attitude which would be fine if they weren't both playing organisational roles in a political party. 

Is there a personal element? Absolutely. It makes me personally uncomfortable. Is it the only reason we're calling them out? No. However I might be the a**hole because my partner and I have called them out in front of others. I might be the a**hole for saying anything at all because who am I to tell people they shouldn't show affection towards each other?",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my friend off,"There's this friend of mine who I've known for over 5 years and we've never had problems before. She likes to pinch my cheeks or ruffle my hair or hug or do something to that effect every now and then. I've never really been comfortable with any form of physical touch more than a handshake or a little hug but I've always ignored it since she means no harm. 
When I once asked her why she does that, she replied that she finds my cute like a little puppy.
Recently I was upset about something else and when she came to pinch my cheeks, I snapped at her in misdirected anger. She got upset and not 30 seconds after this transpired I apologised to her saying the same.

She then told me that I hurt her and mentioned that she is a person capable of ghosting others and that she has done it before. Unsurprisingly she did. I thought her anger would fade with time but it has been quite some time. 

So all I want to know is if I am the A-hole in this situation here. Tbf I'm actually relieved that it has stopped but it feels weird not having her talk to me like usual.

I just want to put it out there that we haven't been really close (we text probably once a month or so and when we meet in person we talk like there's no temporal gap between the last time we spoke and now).

Edit 1:
I saw some comments and saw that I had a little more explaining to do
1. I did apologise to her profusely. I am not exaggerating when I said that I apologised for shouting immediately after what happened. I did it in person and later in the day over text too.
2. I did tell her multiple times to stop it(over the years) but since I didn't want to hurt her, I probably put it in a way that could be mistaken for telling no playfully.

Edit 2:
1. First of all thanks a million guys, your views and points really gave me perspective
2. Second, she came back to me after 4 weeks as if nothing happened. This time I told her plainly that I'd like to keep my personal space. She again paid no heed and continued to behave like she did before. I told her straight that if she was going to continue to do this, I am definitely going to be rude to her and I won't apologise this time because I've warned her. She needs to find some middle ground. Neither zenith nor nadir.",Not the A-hole
AITA For keeping some of my Grandfathers ashes and not telling my Mother?,"I ( f29) understands the question its self would make me the A-hole but hear me out. My Grandfather passed in February of this year and we had his funeral back in June. From the time he passed till the time of the funeral I was the main person doing things. I cleaned his room and went through his clothes, I do not live in that house he and my Mother (46) lived in the same house. I'm also expected to go to her house to finish going through all of his things and pack up some of his things she doesn't want to get rid of.

I planed, made the flower arrangements, bought and cooked/baked all the food. His life insurance covered his cremation and the church rental that's it. I paid for his urn ( she didn't tell me what size to grab for him) , 3 necklaces (only 2 for family 1 for someone he used to babysit, then she babysat when my mother and uncle were younger) and made sure there was a notice about the funeral. My mother, who I had to force to do this, was in charge of making sure people were invited to it, I made the Facebook group so all she had to do was send out the invitations. When his Urn came in I was only able to actually fit just over half of him in there, I also filled all 3 necklaces. On the day of the funeral I find out not only did she not want my uncle, her brother, to attend she made it a point to make sure he was out of town and told him day of the funeral when/where it was. All the way up to this point I was just to busy to remember to tell her I couldn't fit all of my Grandfather in the urn I got him. I want to give my uncle some of his fathers ashes so he has a bit of his father with him. I grew up with my Grandfather as more of a parent then my own parents so I would also like to keep some of him.

AITA for kicking my mom out of my house?,"I(F36) married with 2kids(F8)(M5) live with my mom(F73) since 5 years ago. She didn't want to live alone and for money reasons. These past 5 years have been awful. My mom doesn't like my husband(M41) and she let's him know. She'd make dismissive comments, cook for everyone and leave nothing for him, badmouth him with neighbors and family...The relationship between my husband and myself is not perfect at all, but when it comes to my mom, he is polite and doesn't pay attention to the things she does. He says we should honor our parents no matter what.

My mom is not great either with the kids, my husband and I work full time so she stays home with them. I know she's no longer 20, I've offered her multiple times to hire someone to help her out with the kids, someone who would also clean, but she refuses. She doesn't trust anyone. She asked me to pay her to babysit instead of hiring someone, so that's what I do. But, she is not attentive to the kids, last month alone, she made them skip 3 meals because she ""didn't think they were hungry"". I arrived home after work and the kids hadn't had lunch. I'm not a patient person. We always fight about those issues, we yell at each other and my husband mediates.

Things got worse 2years ago when my husband and I converted to a faith different than hers. My mom's very religious, she thinks she's the only one who holds the truth. When I'm home, she plays videos at a very high volume, with sermons she thinks apply to me. She believes I'll change my ""erroneous ways"" if I hear a religious old man screaming on youtube. I asked her though, multiple times, not to talk religion to the kids, I want them to make their own choice when they grow up. The conflict started cause I found out through my daughter that she's been endoctrinating the kids into her religion for months. She told my 8yo daughter that I had a demon in me and that I couldn't be trusted. My daughter told me that my mom prays for them to be punished by God cause punishment means love and that my daughter should not tell me any of this cause I'd kick my mom out of the house. She told my 8yo that if I do kick her out, it would be her fault. My daughter was conflicted, she loves her grandma but she also loves me and didn't understand what was happening.

When I found out 2 weeks ago, I lost it, I called my husband and he was furious too. It was the first time I saw him that angry at her. We talked calmly to her though and asked her to leave. I told her to ask her church for a housing solution, that I didn't want her in my home.

But now, the anger has passed and I feel horrible, she's 73 after all, it feels like I'm abandoning her during her old days, when she needs me the most. She does not have any source of revenu, I pay for everything she needs. But she's still convinced that she's right, that I have demons and that she did the right thing. she's leaving next week God knows where and I feel like a piece of sh't. AITA?",Everyone Sucks
"AITA for finally telling my brother the truth, but throwing my parents under the bus to do so?","AITA for finally telling my brother the truth, but throwing my parents under the bus to do so?

I (36m) used to run a company with my (35m) brother and both my parents. It was supposed to be the dream of the sons taking over the family business. I had the ability to work in every department, so over the course of the last 10 years I progressed to running the company. My brother, who worked harder than anyone else, floundered with any real responsibility. He was the ultimate task doer, but ask him to manage anyone or anything, and it would be a dumpster fire.

My parents would protect my brother by tying my hands behind my back in regards to saying anything bad to my brother about the quality of his work, or how he was failing at being a manager. My parents did not want his feelings to be hurt. My brother would get moved to a different department, or have his job description change so he wasn't in charge of anything that would hurt the company. They would never tell him he wasn't doing his job right, they would never tell him he sucked at his job. It was easier for  them to lie to him, so they could avoid any conflict or hurt feelings.

I was complicit in this. I kept up the lies, I played the game. Resentments grew. My brother was still getting paid the same as me, I was running the company, at this point he was basically still in a entry level position. So 2 years ago I started a different company and left the family one. Less than a year later, my parents asked me to come back. I accepted on the condition that my brother would be bought out of the company. They agreed.

So with my brother being bought out, I am now running the company solo, we gave him a group of our customers that he now services under his own company name, life is good, or so I though.....

I found out by one of my employees, that my brother has been stealing product out of our warehouse. They were under the impression that we had some sort of deal worked out with me because we were family. NOPE..... He was just plain stealing.

So when I confront my brother, he admits to stealing, but went off on this rant on how I never respected him, that I was the biggest asshole because I was mean, and on and on. So then and there I decided to stop lying, and essentially told him all of the lies from the last 10 years. How he got the short end of the stick because no one ever told him what he was doing wrong. How our parents just didn't want to hurt his feelings, but knew he couldn't run the company. I was done lying, I just sat there and told the truth.

So my parents are now mad at me because he's mad. Like MAD MAD, and he has gone no contact with them, and they are worried that they wont be able to ever see him or their grandchildren again.

So AITA for finally telling my brother the truth, but throwing my parents under the bus to do so?

EDIT: To add to more information to this story, it was not like my brother was thrown into a situation without training. We provided informal training on how to learn more about the business (Like this is how we do the books, come with me on the jobsite so I can show you this). Formal training both trade specific and management courses. He was not thrown to the wolves, he just never cared to pick it up, or try to step up. 

I left the company because of the toxic environment and all of the built up resentments.

I came back to the company because my parents retirements are tied to the company and without a son to run it or a sale, they would have lost everything. I still run the other company I started.

Last, I knew I was an asshole for what I did to my brother. When I told him the truth, I was also apologizing to him for my part in all of it. I was asking if I was the asshole for throwing my parents under the bus in the truth/apology.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for uninviting my brother to my wedding over inheritance?,"So recently I've uninvited my brother(29) to my wedding after his behaviour with regards to inheritance from our recently departed grandmother. 

Our grandmother died (it sucks but was expected) and I sh*t you not 2 days after she had died, he's ""explaining"" to me how much inheritance we are getting. This was also my mother's birthday. Literally 2 days afterwards. 

He'd googled the price of her assets and looked at the will (not because he was asked to but he wanted to see what he was getting) and ""done the maths""
After pointing out how disgusting his behaviour was I excused myself and left as I don't have time for that. 

Fast forward to a group chat created by another brother to try and smooth things out before the funeral. This did not go as planned for that brother. Within 10 minutes I'd been told I need to to get both sides of the story but it's ok because I'm getting married so I can say as I please.

I'm a very black and white kind of person, I say things how I see them and if I offend someone, well then be offended. At no point had I provoked him yet me getting married clearly was a cheap shot from him and that didn't sit right with me. So I told him where to stick it and while he's there to throw my wedding invite out.

Now fast forward again to the day of the funeral. Family members are telling me to clear the air. How our grandmother wouldn't want this.  Normal guilt tripping stuff. 

At no point had he made an effort to even attempt to justify his sh*tty behaviour but here at the funeral I'm the bad guy for uninviting him? Both of my grandparents would be turning in their graves if they could see how he is acting. 

So AITA for uninviting him? Most of my family think I am

Edit: Out of all my brother's (5 in total) we have the least communication between all of us. His behaviour over the years has never been great (committed fraud with other family members ID and that's barely the start) but the moment our grandmother passed he was all of her things. The cheap shot about how I can say as I please as I'm getting married made no sense but it was the final straw for me.

Edit 2: After speaking to my mother this morning I have just found out he has taken a loan out with the intention of paying it off with his inheritance. We buried my grandmother 3 days ago. 

Edit 3: This is one of many issues over the years on this side of the family. They have always been drawn towards drama and as we've gotten older I mainly see most of them at funerals and weddings. Our uncle wasn't involved in the funeral because he'd been arrested for breaking into our grandmother's. I hate the drama and I don't want to be a part of it.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for walking around the house in underwear so my husband would ask his brother to stay in a hotel?,"I used to be close with my brother-in-law but we aren’t anymore due to how he treated my best friend. I don’t hate him or anything but I would prefer he wasn’t staying in my home.

When my husband told me he was coming to visit, I made it clear I didn’t want him staying here but my husband wouldn’t budge and said his visit would be shorter if he was here as they could work out what they were going to do about some family assets they were thinking about selling more quickly.

Seeing him in my home was irritating me, especially since he’s the type of person who loves making dumb sarcastic jokes constantly. I tried asking my husband to ask him to go stay in a hotel 2 days into his visit but he again wouldn’t budge so I outright told my brother-in-law I didn’t want him here but that still wasn’t enough to make him leave.

I finally decided to walk around the house in my underwear because I knew he wouldn’t be able to resist making a stupid comment and it would annoy my husband enough to make him ask his brother to stay in a hotel, which is exactly what happened. After my husband told him to go, my brother-in-law accused me of thinking I was hot stuff who tried to lead my husband around by his dick and made a point to tell me it would backfire if I kept this up. My husband also asked me if I wasn’t going to continue the show during a fight as I stopped doing it once his brother left as my husband often has guests coming and going during the day which made walking around our home in my underwear awkward. He was already upset with me but the fact that I stopped immediately after his brother left seems to have upset him even more.

AITA for missing my FIL's funeral after my MIL booked my husband first class but me ecconomy?,"
Me f31 and my MIL don't have a close relstionship. She's civil towards me but can be a bit passive aggressive at times and we tend to disagree often times.


We live in a different state. FIL passed away suddenly and MIL told me and my husband to come attend the funeral. She booked our tickets to fly to her state. But the issue started when my husband told me that we couldn't sit together in the plane because his mom had booked him a first class ticket while I got ecconomy. I was flabbergasted by this. I tried asking him why but he urged me to ""suck it up, and we'll talk about it later"". In that moment, that particular moment I felt so much humiliation and contempt. I felt like she was treating me as less then even in her hard times. I decided to not go and just go back home. My husband was shocked by my decision to go home and tried to convince me to just go but I declined.


He went alone and I ended up missing the funeral. He was livid just calling m3 and texting nasty things calling me petty and spoiled. He said that I should be grateful his mom paid for my ticket to begin with then said that she doesn't OWE me a Goddamn thing. I argued about how she could've just booked us both in economy if money was an issue but he called me pathetic for thinking about it when his dad just died. He said it was cruel what I did and that his mom and family will never forget that I missed the funeral over ridiculous reasons.


AITA for going home over this? 

ETA. One of the reasons I didn't settle for the ecconomy ticket was because I wanted to sit next to my husband and support him. He sobbed the whole ride to the airport and I didn't want to leave his side. I was shocked when he told me we couldn't sit together, and how he said it like he had no issue with it.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for leaving my friends at the movie theater?,"I \[early 30s\] invited two friends (who are boyfriend and girlfriend) — Tim \[early 30s\] and Sam \[mid 20s\], respectively — to see a showing of My Neighbor Totoro in theaters today. We made the plans maybe five days ago. Tim and Sam live an hour south of the theater; I live an hour north of it.

Yesterday, I asked if they would like to catch lunch beforehand. They declined, stating they were going to Tim's parents' house today first, which is about two hours north of where they live.

The movie was at 4 PM and I left my apartment at \~1 so I could catch lunch near the theater and do some language studying, a hobby of mine. About 2 hours before movie started, I texted my friends to see if they were on the road. They didn't respond. 45 minutes later, I texted again, and they said they were on the road, but would be 10 minutes late. According to Sam, they didn't realize that the town we were meeting up in was over an hour away from Tim's parents', despite being considerably further north.

I arrive at the theater and try to buy my ticket at the kiosk. Apparently, you have to buy online, but there is assigned seating. I purchase 3 tickets for no less than $50.40 so we can all sit next to each other in the same row, texting Tim/Sam to let them know what's up. Sam asks how she and Tim will be able to get into the showing if I have the tickets. I told her I would wait by the kiosk. Then she informs me they'll actually arrive 20 minutes late, blaming traffic.

20. minutes. late.

At this point, I'm livid. I talked to a third party and explained everything, and I was told my feelings were normal. This third party told me I should have considered the fact Tim/Sam have been late before for other events. (Funny enough, the ulterior motive I had for inviting them to lunch was to make sure we were all in the same place BEFORE the show, due to their chronic tardiness.) Even so, I feel you do your due diligence to arrive on time to events, especially if someone is waiting on you.

So, I wrote Tim/Sam in our group chat. This is unedited. Slashes for message breaks:

I'm just gonna be real rn / Y'all gotta work on your timing / Like it sucks knowing I didn't even want to come to the dub but I met you halfway on that / Cuz I would have rather done the sub / And then y'all don't look up directions beforehand? / Idk / If it was the first time this had happened I would let it slide / But I'm miffed af rn

No response.

By now, it was a full 20 minutes past the start time. I thought to myself that if it got to be 4:25, I would start toward my car. Lo and behold, I'm in my car at 4:28, start the engine, and get a call at 4:29. ""Hey, we're here, where are you?"" asks Sam. ""I just got in my car. I'll forward you the tickets. Enjoy the show."" And I hang up.

Following that, Sam wrote in the group chat, ""So glad we rushed here"". To which I responded, ""Fuck your sarcasm are you kidding me / Rushed to be 30 min late lmao I'm dead"" No response since then.

So, there you have it. AITA for leaving my friends at the movie theater?",Everyone Sucks
AITA for letting my friend’s ex-girlfriend into his house party?,"My friend, Eric, broke up with his ex, Amber, and claimed it was because he had been madly in love with me since childhood and he couldn’t take it anymore. He’s used me as his fake excuse to break up with previous girlfriends too, but none of them have ever confronted me or made me feel as bad as Amber did.

She wanted to talk to him but Eric wouldn’t respond to her so since I was pissed at him and feeling sorry for her I told her about the house party he was hosting and I let her in on the day. There wasn’t a big scene or anything at the party between them. Eric and Amber spoke privately and she left after. 

Yet he’s still mad at me and acting like what I did was worse than what he did. When he confronted me I just started telling him off and yelling at him instead of apologising. Our friends are siding with him but that’s not really a surprise.

AITA for starting a fight over my husband not responding.,"My husband (28m) and I (29f)have been together 8 years.
He has a habit of not responding when I talk that drives me up the wall and honestly makes me feel terrible. It feels like what I say doesn't matter and that he's just waiting for me to stop talking.
We will be sitting down looking right at one another and I will be telling him about something (today was about issues I'm having with my doctor) and he will just not respond.
No ""wow that sucks"" ""damn"" 
Nothing.
This is something I've spoken to him about a LOT. He just doesn't see anything wrong with it. ""Not everything needs a response"" 
At this point we are on complete opposite sides with no one budging.

AITA for not telling my fiance I'm an orphan until we were planning our wedding + telling prospective MIL and FIL that I didn't want them to be my parents,"I (26M) am an orphan of the ""left at the doorstep of the fire station"" variety. No name, information, birthday, anything. I guess I wasn't a very cute kid, because I was never adopted. Then I went through a series of foster homes and the things that happened made me wish the US had actual orphanages, because at least workers are there for money, not whatever twisted fuckery they think is ""parenting.""

I grew up bitter and worked hard, desperate to prove myself on the off chance that they'd see and come back. When no one was there for high school graduation, I broke down. Then I let go of the resentment, but in order for that to happen, I also let go of ever wanting anything resembling parents.

I went to college and then got into med school. Not because of a particular interest in medicine, but because no matter what happened, someone would always need a doctor. I fell in love with a classmate and we started dating. I never told her that I was an orphan, only telling her my parents were chronically absent (true) and someone else took care of me (also true).

After two years of dating, she proposed the day after our graduation six months ago. I was so happy that I finally had physical evidence (and a rather expensive ring at that) showing I was worthy of being loved that I didn't remember parents are at weddings, so I'd need to tell her.

edit: the ""physical evidence"" bit was tongue in cheek. I grew up without gifts like that and I learned to make do. The salient part is that that was the happiest that I've ever been, and I didn't want to jeopardize that by unloading my past.

We matched at the same hospital where her family lived, so we moved in together there, and after the 12th unsolicited visit from her mother asking what our plans for the wedding was, I decided to tell my fiance in a probably crude way. I told her that my parents were chronically absent because I didn't know who they were and ""someone else"" was the foster homes. After asking a couple questions, she ran away to her parents to discuss my parentlessness, then they all came back for dinner.

My prospective MIL said that she and prospective FIL wanted me to think of them as my parents from now on and that she'd be my mother for the wedding. I thanked them but said I wasn't interested in having parents of any kind. But, she insisted, everyone should know a parent's love. I made a joke about a mouse in my research eating its baby. She pushed again and I said it'd be akin to stepsibling incest. Then PFIL slammed the table and yelled at me for not taking his wife or daughter seriously, and I snapped, telling them to get a grip and go find my parents if they wanted me to have them and God I hope they have better luck than I did. They shut up and left.

Later, my fiance and I were going to the room they were holed up in to apologize and talk calmly, when we overheard them talking about the situation. They were really concerned...about what it would look like to Gramps if his granddaughter was marrying an orphan. See, that's the kind of thing I've come to expect from parents.

But my fiance is still upset and demanding to know what else I'm hiding from her. The answer is nothing, her parents and her gigantic family that won't fit in a damn farmhouse are obviously important to her but I never knew mine so this wasn't a huge secret, just something I didn't like talking about.

AITA? or even if I am, is there anything else I could've done to get a better outcome?

some clarifying details:

When I made this post, I knew Lola's (fiancee (I can't believe I've been spelling it wrong this entire time and no one pointed it out)) family was rich but there's rich and then there's influential, both of which they are. I only knew about the latter part in vague details before the events happened because I didn't care before and Lola becoming a doctor was in part an effort to break away from the mold of the family so she doesn't like going into too much detail.

They are deeply entrenched in the businesses and local government of the US South and are conservatives, so my lack of heritage is a problem to them not only in a social lens but also in a practical one in terms of possible scandals/campaign ammunition (eg ""your homelessness policy sucks horse cock and yet your son/nephew/grandson in law was 12 dollars away from being homeless in 2014. Curious.""). That's why it's become an issue. Prospective FIL has been told point blank that they don't want a ""nameless bastard"" marrying into the family.

update:

Thanks everyone for the comments. Mostly everyone has been pretty helpful, even if I disagree (and if you weren't, I raged at you, so the universe is in balance) and after taking a step back, I've seen some of the faults in my thinking.

re: AITA?

I'm the asshole for keeping my status as an orphan from Lola only for the reason that she is the person I've decided to dedicate my life to, so I should trust her with everything about my life. I don't agree that I should've told her because if it turns out she has a problem with orphans, that's wasted time for both of us (more on that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zfe8sv/comment/izicjhp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), nor do I agree that I lied. I was never under the illusion that I could keep it a secret forever, but I don't see the issue in having waited past a year or six months or whatever subjectively defined timeline you (in the royal sense) personally might've wanted to know about it. All relevant factors (eg not being a Strong Family Man) are exactly the same whether I'm an orphan or just have really absent parents.

I'm the asshole for saying vulgar shit to prospective MIL and FIL in an attempt to distract away from the topic of me considering them as my parents. They've apologized for not taking more time to understand my situation. They simply thought didn't have parents = wants parents. I've apologized for what I said. I'm glad that a lot of replies here are understanding of my desire to just leave the ""parents"" section of my life blank; PMIL and PFIL still think it's just a defense mechanism that I'll eventually get past.

re: therapy

Not entirely sold on talking to a therapist instead of just talking to her, but at least one of the two is happening.

re: Lola

We are doing extremely well. I figured I'd be, at the very least, occupying the couch for a bit, but on the first night, she came out after brushing her teeth telling me to hurry up and come to bed as if it was my fault or something. Sometimes dreams do come true.

There's been a little adjusting as she comes to terms with the new information, but she trusts that there's not anything else I'm hiding and I'm not.

re: the family's reaction and marriage

We're still engaged, but most of her family is adamantly against us getting married for the reasons laid out above. Her parents are one of the few on our side (oops). Hope things can cool down so we can get married without incident but it's out of our hands for the time being.

"AITA for ""ruining my 15 year old daughter's Christmas""","Today my, (30 F) daughter, (15 F) threw a massive tantrum over the gifts she had received for Christmas. As you can tell by the age I had my daughter very young, my parents didn't kick me out but offered very little support. As my daughter grew up I tried to give her the best life possible, I made sure she had almost everything from her list. Today when me and my daughter were opening presents she got angry over the fact that I had gotten her a blue ipad 10 instead of the pink one. She threw the ipad in my lap and stormed to her room screaming how I was the worst mother in the world and that I ruined Christmas. She didn't even finish opening the rest of the presents. In return to her outburst about the present, I grabbed the rest and took them to my car. My 15 year old then came running out to my car and asked me what I was doing. I told her I was giving the presents to people who would actually enjoy them. At that point my daughter started balling her eyes out saying i'm the worst mom ever, I got into my car and drove to a friend  and gave her children  the gifts. But now I have been getting messages and calls from family members saying I am an asshole. So, AITA for ""ruining my 15 year olds christmas""?

EDIT/UPDATE: For AITA for ""ruining my 15 year old daughters christmas""?

As I read through your comments I now understand I should have communicated with her. Also for some answers to some of your questions, no her father hasn't been in the picture since I was pregnant, also she always was appreciative for her gifts no matter what they were, and for everyone saying I should have specifically gotten her the pink one I didn't even know she wanted a specific color she just asked for the new ipad. 

Earlier today I sat down with my daughter and asked about why she was upset. She told me it wasn't even about the Ipad, she was upset because some random people had been bullying her about me and how I was a teen mom. This was happening in school and online. I sat and talked with her more, how we could fix it, and if there was anything she could always come to me. I had saved one gift from the ones I gave away, it was the Ipad. She thanked me and said it was all she needed.

I truly thank all of your for helping me realize I was in the wrong.",Everyone Sucks

WIBTA for disinviting an envious friend from my wedding?,"I (22F) am getting married to (22M) in a large city near my hometown. I was best friends with (23M) in highschool. We all were accomplished in hs however, 23M had a difficult time post; he dropped out of college and had a major career setback. I am in a great career while fiancé is attending an amazing grad school.

I remained in contact but began noticing that every convo is either me initiating or him bragging. Odd but thought maybe it's insecurity; I'll help by asking more about his life and complimenting his success. This dynamic went for years and there were moments that stung, though I never told him. Including a dry text of ""congrats"" when I got engaged, never asking about my gap year abroad, saying happy bday on the wrong day twice! and immediately switching topics when I shared what school fiancé got into.

The past year I've limited contact. My fiancé and mutuals already stopped contact because the bragging. I suspected he'd get over it eventually until two major incidents:

1. I sent out e-invites, no response. Instead (same night) he sent me a photo of the ring he bought and bragged about the price. I said “congrats and I was excited to see them take this huge step.” Weeks later, still no response. I remind him, he hearts message with no reply/apology, but did rsvp.
2. Recently, he posted a photo of his fiancé and him visiting the same venue we’re getting married at! I was hurt cause we’re in a major city with plenty other venues in that same style. Our venue is also quite new/niche and was selected for a reason close to us, but not to them. This, plus having our invites and socials made me feel it couldn't be a coincidence. I message him ""hey so you're thinking of x venue as well?"" he replies, ""really? lol that's so funny"" No apology for a potential misunderstanding.

Next day, I initiated a call and explained my feelings. He quickly admitted he was envious of my partner and I the entire time! He apologized saying no one has ever told him he comes off this way and he has a hard time keeping friends. He claimed the venue was not malicious, but couldn't give a reason why they selected to view it. He claimed neither of them knew we were getting married there.

I accepted his apology and said they both could still attend our wedding. I asked him to confront his fiancé, tell me what’s said, and to do the work to fix his envy towards others.

It's been a week; he hasn't said anything to me. I'm trying to give benefit of the doubt since I can't confirm malice, but I'm in so much emotional pain. I'm considering disinviting them both as a boundary. 

I'd give him a second chance for friendship in case he is being genuine. However, my fiancé says disinviting is relationship ending. While I feel like right now, I don't mind losing an envious friend, I’m conflicted cause it's partially my fault that he was unaware of how much his behavior was irritating me.",Everyone Sucks
WIBTA for revealing my friend’s racist and homophobic remarks to the college she's accepted to?,"We are seniors in high school in a private religious school. Lia frequently makes remarks that are blatantly anti-LGBT+ (not a week goes by that I don't hear ""f*ggot"", she makes fun of people who use they/them, mocks the acronym with “lgbtqrstuv…”) or racist (""black people statistically are just dumber."" In an outburst: ""you can't get it through your little black brain of yours,"" and more)

She often says I'm too offended at everything and will ""test"" me by saying hateful comments. I am never offended in the way she thinks, just angry and disappointed because my three closest friends in our group of four all share this mindset. Just Lia specifically is the absolute worst. She always dismissed every comment as just a joke, which puts me on the end of “wow a joke offended you.”

She even indicated that she was gay in a college application question to improve her chances. She also says she hated doing it but put her preferred pronouns in emails to a scholarship officer because the officer had it in the email signature. She didn't want to register as a republican because she thinks colleges will reject her for it. The hypocrisy is throwing me off.

I can't completely blame her. She's born into a very rich family, they have servants in her estate in Mexico. She hates anything that benefits minorities, like international SATs or affirmative action (but still benefits from this herself). Her entire character is being vulgar and mean to people, so it's not really shocking to others.

I've compiled screenshots of every message sent to me that has offensive content. I understand that doing something like this, if believed by the university, could completely destroy the path forward in her life. I feel strongly towards encouraging change but I am just mocked for it and at a breaking point. I don’t want to make any decisions out of anger either.

I don't want her to go on like this. I have no power in this high school’s religious culture, so this is what I have to resort to—I'm just hoping it will be a wake up slap to the face. Would I be the asshole?",Everyone Sucks
AITA for asking my family to announce farts or go to the bathroom to fart?,"I (50F) have asked my family (47M, 15M, 14F) to either state beforehand if they are going to make a stinky fart or go to the bathroom to fart and then light a match after. Today at the breakfast table my husband did the thing where he leans to one side to lift a buttcheek (I assume? Actually not sure what the purpose of the leaning is) to fart loudly. Hilarious, sort of, but also gross. He does this infrequently.

This began a discussion where everyone told me that my fart rules are body shaming and not cool. They were tongue-in-cheek but also serious about the body shaming. I told them no one wants to smell surprise stinkiness (hence the announcing) which wouldn't be necessary if people would just go to the bathroom to fart (ideal). According to them, not farting loudly or stinkily in front of others is a just me thing or maybe just a UK thing (I grew up in the UK). No one has suggested that it's an on-the-spectrum thing because my family doesn't hold that over my head, but I wonder. And I honestly find it gauche to like, have a farting stance, but again, they say that's just me. Really? We live in Mexico and I haven't noticed any public farting.

My family says within the family it's fine to just fart away. Some context: I got massively told off by my in-laws in the pandemic year where we were always together for dinner for suggesting people refrain from talking with food in their mouths at the table in front of my kids, because we were trying to teach them this rule. That was true, but also I really find it disgusting when people do that. Normally we live in a different country so I suck it up when we're all together. But this was every night, so that day it became a huge fight between me and my husband where I slept on the couch for days and refused to eat at the table if we couldn't agree on what I thought was basic manners specially as an example for my kids but honestly because I hate it. My mother-in-law has ADHD and she says if she stops talking to chew she'll forget what she has to say and then she won't be able to tell us. Plus, it was her table, her house. I realise I was horrible and the lesson I learned there is to not care so hard about manners over people's feelings. (In case anyone wonders, my couch-sleeping has only happened once or twice in my marriage, it's not common).

So here we are, my family has told me they would like to fart freely in the house and my rules are nonsense. I hesitate to disagree because of the talking-with-our-mouths-full episode. I want to be lighthearted and laugh it off. But, stinky! Stinky farts! You can taste them! I think it's pretty reasonable to ask to not live in a fart zone. We (or maybe just me I guess) do have other rules like, knock before entering someone's room, say please and thank you, etc. I'm not going to list them all because of space. So reddit, am I the asshole?

TLDR: I tell my family they should either say they're going to fart or go to a different room to fart. They say this rule is unreasonable. AITA?

EDIT: the farting isn't constant, it's infrequent. Not daily. And it's 90% accidental which we laugh off.

2nd EDIT: The rule is several years old. Possibly decades old for my husband. When I said 'I have asked' I meant, in the past, not recently.",Everyone Sucks

My husband was definitely used as a co-parent; he was expected to change nappies, to cook, clean and take the kids to school even though he was only 11 when Jen was born and even before Jen he was in charge of caring for his mother. He did so much for the children that they call him dad, even though he’s not much older than them.

I’ve asked and asked my husband to distance himself, be a brother instead and prioritise our family now - he can still see his siblings, but currently he’s exhausted because he’s not sleeping properly since he doesn’t have the time. He wouldn’t.

I texted his mother saying how unwell he is, he’s forgetting to take insulin/not sleeping after working nights/anxious all the time, she needs to back off.

AITA for accidentally outing my nephew and his boyfriend?,"My brother and I both work as mechanics at a garage we started together and so all our kids are pretty close  especially our youngest  my son ""Randy"" 15M  and my nephew ""Colt"" also 15M.  They're the exact opposites though  Colt is an all star athlete and a varsity football player  and he's always been a big for his size kid while  Randy is a bit more lithe and does ballet and gymnastics. While not really feminine he's not to traditionally masculine either.

Me and my brother grew up in a small town   and he still holds on a bit more to that traditional thinking more than I'd like and not trying to be malicious but he sometimes jokes about Randy possibly being gay or just kinda joke with him sometimes about how he needs to do more manly stuff like Colt if he wants to get a gf etc.  Randy just usually laughs his uncle off and he's told us it doesn't really bother him.  
We assured we wouldn't care if he' was gay , but he says he's straight and apparently has a gf from his ballet class. 
A while now he's started bringing her around more and few days ago asked me to talk to my  brother about the gay jokes not wanting it to be awkward with his girlfriend.  

Saturday's Randy usually hangs out with Colt and Colt's bestriend ""Keith"" 15M. Keith is literally always around since they were 10, whenever I see Colt  I know Keith isn't far behind and they're always kinda rough housing and playing so I probably shoulda seen it.

 I decided to talk to my brother while the boys were supposed to be going to the park. I sat my brother down and asked him to quit it with the jokes at Randy's expense and he kinda got defensive and  told me that he's just kidding and that he doesn't actually care that Randy is probably gay. That kinda pissed me off a bit and I just yelled at him that  ""at least Randy has a girlfriend unlike  Colter and his boyfriend Keith"".  I didn't realize that the boys has come back because they'd forgotten something and they heard that last bit.  We immediately heard Colt yelling at Randy asking him ""how he could he tell me that ?"" and that's he wasn't supposed to say anything. We got to the back yard and just saw Colt red faced and crying with Randy trying to tell him he didn't say anything and to calm him down.  We finally got Colt to calm down and I told him I didn't know, bit he just got quiet and rand up to his room and stayed there all weekend. I  drove  Keith home and apologized.

Randy's mad at me now and he told me he couldn't believe I said something like that.  I tried to explain that I had no idea ,but he's still mad at me and Colt and my brother still haven't talked , My brother's tried but Colt just hides in his room he won't even talk to Randy.

AITA for being upset that my entire family is going on vacation without me?,"I (24F) am the oldest of 3. We have incredibly wealthy and successful parents. They take us on vacation a lot- we go on at least 2 family trips per year. They have also invited my boyfriend of 5 years to the past 2 vacations which I have expressed my gratitude for.

I live 3 hours away from my parents and am a software engineer. I support myself financially at least 95% and have unlimited PTO.

My brother (22M) recently graduated college and will be starting a job as a consultant at a big 4 company in the fall, meaning he makes a salary comparable to mine. My sister (18F) is a freshman in college with no job. 

Since my sister was the only child at home for all of her high school years, my parents took her away on a vacation (without me or my brother) at least once a year during breaks- Vieques, the Cayman Islands, etc. While it kinda sucked for me, I understood that I couldn't go because I had college. And I didn't feel too bad about it because my brother also didn't go. Neither my brother nor I have ever been taken on a parents trip without any siblings. 

Now my sister is out of college and they are still taking her on a vacation to the cayman islands for her spring break. Initially it was just going to be her but they invited my brother later too.

I have plans in a city near my parents so I came home an extra day early to spend time with them. When I got in, my mom acted excited to see me and then immediately took a phone call for an hour. While she was on this phone call, I was talking to my dad who said that they were all going on vacation together next week that my mom had planned. 

This upset me so I confronted my mom both about her ignoring me and about feeling excluded. I said that it hurt my feelings that she didn't include me on this vacation. She said that they only had one room so there wasn't enough room for me. I said that I would have been okay to pay for my own stuff (even though my brother isn't) but I just felt hurt that I was not included. 

Repeatedly throughout this conversation, both of my parents made me feel delusional for being upset. I would say something like ""I'm not angry, I'm just hurt that you didn't include me and it feels like you don't want to spend time with me."" And my mother would respond with ""Is there something else wrong?"" as if I didn't have a reason to be upset. Then my dad would say ""We have taken you on so many vacations in your life. We have even included your boyfriend. Why aren't you grateful for those?"" despite the fact that I started the conversation by saying I am grateful for everything they have done for me. 

I kept saying that they were missing the point. The point of the conversation was that they made me feel hurt by excluding me. It isn't about money, past vacations, gratitude, or anything but my sadness. All I asked for was an apology and I have not gotten one.

AITA for telling my husband to get rid of our son’s dog?,"I’ve been terrified of dogs since I was young. My husband knew but I don’t think he realised how bad it was until recently. He got our son a dog and at first, I was angry but he promised it wouldn’t come near me and our son was really happy so I agreed they could keep it as long as it was kept away from me.

For 2 months it was fine and I barely thought about the dog being so close but a few days ago the dog came inside and it freaked me out. I told my husband he had to get rid of it now since he broke his promise and I didn’t trust him to keep it away from me anymore.

My husband doesn’t want to get rid of it because our son is very attached to it already and the dog is harmless according to him. He wants me to let him take me around the dog so that I’ll stop being so scared of it but I’ve refused and told him it had to go. We argued and he told me that if I wanted it gone, I would have to take it myself.

My in-laws came to visit yesterday and my mother-in-law asked me if something had happened between us because I’m still angry at him and she noticed. I told her about the dog and she told him off and said she taught him better than to traumatise his pregnant wife. Now my husband is upset at me because he thinks I only told his parents to force him to do what I wanted and that we’d hurt our son if we got rid of the dog now.

AITA for not checking the scores of a certain NBA game on a 3 hour flight for a passenger on a in-flight WiFi I paid for?,"I was on a 3 hour flight on a airplane traveling back home.

AITA for secretly disliking my friendgroup that i have to see everyday??,"hi, f(17) here and i absolutely cannot stand my high school ""friend"" group that i'm in right now if theyre even considered that.

AITA for leaving misleading my coding competition teammates about the gender of the friend I invited to our team and then forming a new team with just her.,"I (20M) am a college student in computer engineering. In my university the CE program has a bunch of pre-req classes that everyone has to take so we know most of our batch mates.

&#x200B;

Background: There are very few women in the program and most students men. One of these women, Lisa is very girly in the way she dresses, like coming to campus dressed like a model, wearing heels. bright pink etc. I did a group project once with her and we became good friends and ended up leasing an apartment together. She is really smart, has a perfect GPA and is good in computer networking and some aspects of computer graphics. I have good skills in networking as well due to some side projects I do.

&#x200B;

I do not get along with some of the other men as when I hang out with them they get quite rowdy and say racist and sexist things that make me uncomfortable. They make fun of my friend and how she dresses behind her back a lot before they knew I was friends with her. Eventually since she was friends with most of the other women in our program, I ended up with a friend group that is mostly women.

&#x200B;

There was a hackathon recently and I joined after an acquaintance reached out to me. Some team members were one of these rowdy people I disliked but I agreed anyway.

&#x200B;

The day preceding the hackathon we discussed recruiting one more team member and I mentioned having a friend who is really good and whose abilities would be useful. I kept using the pronoun ""They"" and not she. I asked my friend and she was excited to join and spent the day practicing some things related to graphics shaders which could come in handy. I did not add her to the fb group chat and just had her show up to the event to sign up there.

&#x200B;

When I got her to meet the team, the self appointed team lead, was like Oh we decided we just want to be a team of 4, since it would be too hard to coordinate 5 people. My friend was visibly upset but said she doesn't mind leaving since she did not feel like being in a team alone.

&#x200B;

I felt shitty and said I could form a team of 2 with her instead. The others had a surprised Pikachu face when I said that, and asked me if I'm sure.

&#x200B;

They needed networking skills for their initial idea and had to come up with a new one. We ended up doing something requiring the same skills as their original idea but that was definitely a different idea. However we might not have come up with that if I had not known their idea first.

&#x200B;

In the end their project was incomplete and we ended up winning first place. 2 of the team members were very mad at me and called me an AH, told me some nasty things about me being a ""simp"", white knight and saying we only won because of her ""pussy pass"" and that I probably did all the work. They said it was misleading of me to not say who the friend was and use the pronoun they instead of she when they knew the person. They claimed it was not about her being a woman just that she sucked.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for getting rid of my daughter’s dog,"I, 39F, have a daughter who is 16. For her birthday, about 3 months ago, all she wanted was a dog. 

I don’t mind pets but I never really wanted any in my house. My daughter has always begged to get a dog or a cat and up until this point I have said no. 

This time I really thought about it. She is a good kid and I figured since she was turning 16 she was mature enough to take care of it. 

I agreed to get her a dog but I made plenty of rules. The main rule being that she was the one who would take care of the dog. Feeding, walking and taking it outside. 

She was very happy about this and we went to a local shelter. We ended up adopting a small mixed breed dog who is quite friendly and overall well behaved. 

We all grew very attached to the dog, I have a 10 year old son as well and he instantly fell in love with him. 

Everything was going well for a month. Eventually the dog started peeing & pooping in the house. I would text my daughter about this asking if she took him outside and she would say she forgot. 

Since she was at school I was the one who had to clean up the poo. This happened maybe 4 times. Each time I lectured my daughter about taking care of her dog. I made a point to emphasize that it was HER dog and she was responsible for him. 

There were also quite a few times where my daughter texted me from school saying she forgot to feed the dog and asking me to. 

On Friday she went to school as usual. I walked past her room at some point and the door was closed, I heard the dog barking from inside the room. I let him out and texted her what happened. 

She said he must have been in there and she closed the door without realizing it. The dog was fine, he was only in there for about 3 hours but I asked her what would have happened if I didn’t hear the dog. He would have been in there all day without water or food. 

I was very annoyed since I never wanted any pets. I made a heat of the moment decision to get rid of the dog. I called my sister, who lives 10 minutes away and loves dogs. I asked her if she would take the dog and I also said it may be temporary if my daughter can prove that she’s ready to actually care for him. 

My sister happily agreed and I brought him to her house before work. Of course I intend to take my kids to visit the dog, but I am done taking care of him when it’s supposed to be my daughter. I also feel the dog will be better cared for at my sisters house. 

I explained this to the kids who were extremely upset with me. Both of my kids started crying and my daughter stormed off to her room. All weekend she has been extra mouthy to me and my son has been moping around. 

I feel bad for my son who is very close to the dog and didn’t do anything to deserve him being taken away. I do feel bad for my daughter as well but she broke our agreement. Am I the ass hole?",Everyone Sucks
AITA for going into my ex’s room to get something to wear?,"I left most of my clothes and things behind when I moved out of the home I shared with my ex. Our relationship was pretty bad back then and he never offered me a chance to collect them after. However, things are much better between us now and we’re able to co-parent our two kids. 

He hosted our son’s birthday party and my youngest threw up on me while we were there. I didn’t want to sit around with vomit on me so I went to check if he still had any of my clothes so I could change. He did, so I changed.

I never asked him beforehand as I didn’t see him but his girlfriend saw me coming out of his room and flipped out on me. She kept accusing me of snooping and stealing from them and wouldn’t listen when I explained the clothes were mine.

My ex’s parents got involved to diffuse the situation and my ex said it was fine, but I’m not sure if he meant it or if he only said it to keep the peace in front of his family. He did ask me afterwards what else I had done in his room and his girlfriend was giving me dirty looks the entire time.

AITA for calling my adult sister a child,I F17 and my sister F21 got into an argument over stuff being put on her bed. Since we share a room this happens both ways very often just with small things. This time it started with a pair of sweatpants. We both have the same pair from Christmas so the confusion was understandable. I put them on her bed and she threw them on the floor next to my dresser. When I had woken up the next morning I had moved them to next to her bed(she was sleeping in the bed). I thought nothing of it till she had texted me telling me not to put stuff on her bed. I explain I thought they were hers but if I thought they were hers why would she put them next to my dresser as if they were mine. She got upset and mentioned a wallet and headset that had also been forgotten on her bed.(me and my boyfriend move our bed to the living room when she is home.) they had just been left behind and forgotten about. Things escalated and she told me to loose my attitude and says end of conversation. I tell her she is of no person of authority to me so she should not be telling me to loose an attitude I did not even have. She then ends one of her sentences in all caps PERIOD. I tell her she texts like a highschool girl and she tells “And you don’t know how to be nothing but a b****.” And blocks me. I did not think it was a big deal stuff got forgotten on her bed since they were small. It wasn’t like I spilt a drink on her bed and left it. So AITA,Everyone Sucks
"AITA For ""Making"" My Friend Leave My Wedding Over A Bridesmaid Dress...","I (25F) and my wife (30F) got married about a month ago.

We had a ""Forged In Flame"" themed wedding. As in it was fire themed with a lot of metal in the snow.

But anyways, when we started wedding shopping I knew that above everything else I didn't want to be a Bridezilla. Because I have autism, I have a lot of anxiety around the idea that the wedding wouldn't be fun for others if I had everything perfectly my way (traums)

So to plan for this, part of what made it ""fire themed"" was the color palette. We had: Brown, Red, Orange, yellow, with a touch of blue and/or violet. Etc. The colors we nixed were pink and green because, as a gay couple, we were really against having a 🏳️‍🌈 wedding, yk.

Flash foreward and as me and my bridal party. Our only rule was that it matched the colors and had some sort of train. I was even willing to do any altercations necessary for any of my lads or ladies. Everyone appeared to be super jazzed about shopping. Except my friend ""Clara"". I tried asking her what was wrong.

You see, I wanted the bridal party to stick mostly witu the warmer pallette because my MOH and my Wife's Best man were in blue and purple respectively. So I wanted to go witu the idea of, like I said, a ""touch"" of blue or purple. 

But Clara had found a purple dress that she fell in love with. I at first politely asked her if she would reconsider for now and buying the dress in a different color due to the new circumstances. I even offered to pay for her dress (as I did with all the girls) so she could get a different one and pay for that one herself. Bust she refused. She said that I since I said they could get whatever outfit they wanted that the rules don't suddenly change when it benefits me against her. It was now that the bridal party had caught wind and began asking Clara to calm down. With Ashton (the Best man/Her bf) even offering to change his color. But it wasn't until my Wife stepped in (knowing I was clamming up because my lack of confrontational skills) and said that we won't be paying for a dress we don't want at our wedding. So she can buy it herself ($500) and we'll pay an alternative to wear, she suck it up, or get demoted to a regular guest.

Clara was furious and stormed out of the store. And we were forced to have the wedding without her. I was pretty devastated considering even though I wouldn't call Clara my ""bestie"" she was the friend I had known the longest. Ashton (who still attended and lives with Clara) also said that she felt bad too about missing the wedding.

I'm not at all mad at my wife because she only said it because she knew I was thinking it. As she had approximately 0 care at all about color or theme, etc. And basically left that all up to me. But now I don't know who's in the wrong because I just feel so distraught. So, AMTA???",Everyone Sucks
"AITA for making ""rules"" regarding husband's new motorcycle?","My husband, unbeknownst to me, bought a motorcycle from his best friend at work. It's a sturdy, old Honda from the early aughts in near-mint condition.

I'm horrified. My mother is a nurse and raised us to believe, ""We have a term in the ER for motorcyclists, we call them organ donors."" Made my brother and I promise to never to ride on or get one.

Initially, I demanded he return it, but he said it was his ""life long dream"" to own a bike & kept saying how great it would be on gas. 🏍️

EDIT: *yes he knew my views on bikes before we got married & everytime he brought it up I asked him not to do it*

*I knew he was interested in bikes, but none of this ""life long dream"" stuff*

So I said, ok, keep it, but don't drive it over 30 MPH & don't take it out of our neighborhood. (We have a lot of side roads).

EDIT: *of course, it goes w/o saying he would have to have ""safety gear,"" a decent helmet, & pass the course required to obtain your license. In our state, helmets are mandatory* 

 I said he can also  take it up to the lake where he and his friend go fishing, if he promises he won't drive it over 30 mph and stays off the highway, IOW, tows it up there on a trailer behind our car. 

EDIT: *what I mean here is don't take it on roads where the speed limit is over 30mph or out on the highway. The roads in our neighborhood & around the lake have a posted 25 MPH speed limit.*

*the whole point of the ""riding rules,"" which admittedly aren't great, is I'm trying to find a  reasonable compromise b/c he is insistent on keeping it. I mean, I'm nursing this baby and changing her diapers all day and I can't stand thinking about this anymore*


He says I'm being a controlling harpy and sucking all the fun out of his new toy.

AITA for yelling at my sister for eating my brother's food?,"Sorry for bad typing and stuff... this is my first reddit post and I'm just curious.

Some background just to show that we come from descent chaos:

I grew up with 5 kids in my family, my oldest sister (22, who we will call Ally), my oldest brother (19, who we will call Brandon), my older brother (who we will call Carter), me, and my younger sister (who we will call Diana). My dad is gone a lot for military stuff (he's in the air force) and my mom works too (NP). A moved out a while ago, not sure how long ago, and so did B. I begged my mom to let me have the room to myself because before I had shared a room with D, who I absolutely despise in more of an enemy way than a sibling way.

Anyways, this happened just now. I was in my room relaxing, Carter had gotten home from basketball practice (I play basketball, my mom and all of her siblings did, my grandma + grandpa did, Ally did, Brandon did, and Diana will) and I was cleaning my room. My sister just got home from a softball game and she was happy and stuff because she scored 2 points and she got the game ball of the day. My brother went upstairs to relax and play videogames (he plays football AND basketball so he's always sore and tired, but he enjoys it with passion). I didn't see Diana at the time, but we have a reoccurring problem of my siblings eating each others food, except I never eat my siblings food but they'll eat mine. Diana also comes into my room ALL THE TIME no matter what I say. My brother got Wendy's and stuff and he's a big guy (he's a lineman) so he eats a lot. He came back downstairs and my sister had eaten some of his stuff. He was upset about the food and the fact that she had been sick like just a few days/ a week earlier. He also has some pretty bad anger issues... he got really mad and started yelling at her and she was packing her lunch for school the next day so he just went and put his hands all over her salad. She was upset and she went outside to my mom who was on the phone (our dad isn't home and hasn't been for around a week or so) and she started crying and she had no reason to as I thought, she had brought this upon herself and she knew better. I told my mom what happened and she played it off like ""oh she's hungry and she played hard, let her have a good night""... I know what that feels like when you worked your ass off in a game and just want food, but my mom had cooked and we had steak!!! I was also upset and I yelled at Diana that it wasn't hers and etc. She didn't say anything throughout this whole ordeal. (my mom didn't buy his food, nor did she drive him home. She was watching Diana's game). My sister continuously eats other people's foods and its infuriating as I never get any good food even though I eat the healthiest out of all of us. My sister is also pretty overweight especially for her age and she still eats super unhealthy (the salad is a rare thing).

AITA for not wanting to pay (but still paying) for my daughter’s taxes?,"Clarify: THIS IS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF MY MOTHER AND SO ARE THE COMMENTS

I (50f) and my kids (19f, 18m, and 24f) went to pay our taxes on Friday. We hadn’t had time to pay them due to schedule conflicts, but we were all free that day. We were getting ready to pay and I asked my daughter if was going to pay as she wasn’t getting her card out. She stayed quiet. I took that a sign that she wanted me to pay.

A little background: my daughter is living in a very cramped house. She has a small bathroom, small kitchen, and a living room/bedroom. She recently had a baby and is living with her boyfriend. My (3; other is 16f) kids, husband, and I are living/have been living for 20 years in a small two bedroom apartment. My husband is very abusive so he is basically a stranger living in our house. He has no job due to him being injured at work. So my family and I are struggling getting money to pay bills, rent, etc. My kids are very generous and grateful so they help me pay bills. I feel very horrible always having to ask them to help me pay but they always help with full hearts. I don’t have a job because I am a stay at home mom and if I do get a job, my husband would get angry and completely cut me off from getting any money.

With the small amount of money I have, I am able to pay mine/my husband’s taxes. Due to my daughter also having financial troubles, she doesn’t want to spend any money, even if it means that she will have anyone else pay for her. She is very much in that “independent woman” mind of state but she doesn’t really follow through with her “beliefs.” Once she turned 18, she put herself down as independent on her binding contracts so it looks like she doesn’t depend on our income but her own, even though she had only a job working at our local amusement park. Also, in the “independent woman” stereotypes, they don’t have any relationships, however as soon as she got her first boyfriend, she went from boy after boy. 

Anyway, I had to pay her taxes, although I didn’t want to. I know shes my daughter but I don’t think she understands that i am in debt as well. So aita?

Edit: I wanted to add a bit more stuff on here as I see everyone is commenting about it. Trust me, I really do want a divorce, however, I cannot afford it. But tomorrow is actually my husband’s court trial due to him getting hurt at his job. Hopefully, we will get money and if we get enough, he will be moving out and he will give me the rest of the money to help raise my kids and help them in college. After being settled, I will get a job. And thank you to everyone for being concerned and responding to my post.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for fighting with my wife in front of our child when she called my mother a bad mom?,"My mom was a great mother. I had a really good childhood, especially considering how young she was and that my dad is a piece of shit. I really appreciate how she shielded me from all of that. 

My mom is married to my former boss, and while it sucks for me, I do believe she did her duty as a mother and deserves to be happy. I used to work for ""Brandon"". This was one of those jobs where networking was everything, you really needed the boss to like you, and you had to present a certain image. i will admit I tried way too hard and to put it lightly, Brandon did not like me. He was a condescending ass, and my mom was aware as I vented to her about work. He wasn't outright abusive, but did laugh at me a lot and make a few comments that weren't cool. 

My mom and Brandon met at our wedding. Now I don't believe in love at first sight, but they definitely had something there, and my first instinct was eww, but they got serious really fast and I have to say he makes her really happy, and she has never seemed truly happy before. I hate being around him, wish this never happened, but I am happy for them. My wife thinks my mom is a bad mother for putting herself first.

Recently my five year old son asked why we don't see my mom as much as my in laws (about once a month vs once or twice a week) My wife said that while my in laws were the best parents, my mom was a bad mom because she married Brandon who had not been nice to me, and we don't spend much time with her because she was selfish. 

I was furious and told my son that was not true. I said we don't spend time together because my mom has a busier life, and because MIL doesn't work so they sometimes go over during the day. I said that it was wrong of my wife to say that, and my mom was a great mom. 

My wife told our son I was wrong and a good mom would not have married someone like that. I snapped and told my son not to listen to his mother, and she just doesn't like my mom. I said that women with adult kids should put themselves first and maybe it isn't healthy how much we see MIL, but my mom is a great person and I won't hear anything more about it.

when my son went to play, my wife confronted me and said I undermined her and was acting like a mama's boy. she said I should not have raised my voice (didn't yell, but did raise it) and that I shouldn't be confusing our son when what my mom did was objectively not ok",Everyone Sucks

I don’t want her on the trip so I asked Dante to not bring her. I told him she made me uncomfortable and he said he would need to think about it. 

I guess he told her she couldn’t come and why because she’s angry at me and thinks I’m doing this to cause issues in their relationship. She thinks I shouldn’t go if I’m so uncomfortable around her instead of forcing him to uninvite her. Our group is divided so AITA?",Everyone Sucks

A month later she agrees to meet me in person with her husband and friend (I'm alone) and then (60f) told me i'm toxic and unworthy of friends, refused to tell me why and when I tried explaining my feelings I was shouted at and told I was making excuses and invalidating her, of what I'm still not sure, the meeting ended with me having a panic attack in the middle of a coffee shop. 
Skipping ahead, I just decided to cut contact with them, then (32f) starts messaging me, says the meeting went well and wondering when I wanted to meet again so they could continue teaching me how to be a good friend. I told her I felt the meeting didnt go well and I wasnt interested in meeting them again, she then tells me I'm unsafe, toxic, bordering on the edge of proper crazy and that all the trauma I've faced was my own fault and that they were trying to help me. 
I repeatedly asked her to not contact me but after multiple messages I eventually I told her the reason I didnt want to continue the friendship  was because I felt that (60f) treated me awfully and unfairly and hurt me in the worst possible way, that she was determined to misunderstand me, that she was unkind and based off her behaviour, I didn't believe she was a Christian. I also questioned the (32f) about her faith as she had told me previously that God had gone silent on her, I told her she had a heart full of hate and should be ashamed of herself for the way she treats people. I have literally never heard her say a single kind thing about anyone except (60m) and (60f) When I told her that being called toxic and unworthy of friends was very hurtful to me, she stated that it wasn't meant the way I took it (pretty much verbatim) then a week later she messages saying that the 3 of them had a discussion and determined that (60f) didn't say it at all. 
I then received a message from (60m) saying the things I said about his friend and wife were despicable and horrible, he literally quoted the following ' I have been through all the despicable things you have said to (60f) and (32f), like (60f)  treated you awfully and unfairly and hurt you in the worst possible way, was determined to misunderstand you, and was unkind and not a Christian. That (32f) was full of hate, and that she should be ashamed of herself. All these horrible words are not true'

AITA: blamed boyfriend for making me late because he wouldn’t help.,"My family and I got into a road accident a few weeks ago.  Everyone is fine, but I broke my leg in two places.  

The doctor gave me the ok to go back to school.  I’m (17F) am in a bunch of AP classes and have a lot of books I have to carry with me. It’s hard going between my locker to class because it’s hard to manage a heavy backpack with crutches and a bulky cast.

Last Tuesday, one of my classes ran late.  I was with my boyfriend Josh, who shares both classes with me.  Josh is a heavy guy who prides himself on being in unathletic because why need sports when you have video games?

We’re running to the next class.  I can’t keep up because crutches and heavy backpack make it freaking hard. I asked Josh if he could help me carry some of my books.  He said he can’t because he can’t carry my books plus his. I end up late to class by ten minutes when Josh was on time.

Ms. Sanchez, my teacher, is chastising me for being late.  And I snapped, “well, if Josh wasn’t so out of shape and would help me, I wouldn’t be late!”

I got detention for talking back to the teacher.  And my friends and classmates think try at I’m an asshole for fat shaming Josh.  Josh says I’m unfair to him because I know he’s out of shape, and can’t help me.  I’m just sick of being let down by him all the time! AITA?  Or should I try to be more understanding?

Edit:  we don’t have any turtle patrol, so my teachers haven’t been all that accommodating.  My mom was pissed about the detention and has been hammering the principal and superintendents ear.  Until then, I’m learning go remotely.  She thinks the detention is bs.

As for my ex, I dumped him a few hours ago.  Then he blew up my phone to call me a fucking bitch.  Turns out word got around to his parents.  His parents are hardcore conservatives who think that guys have to help a lady no matter what.  His dad confiscated his Xbox until further notice.

I blocked his number.  Good riddance.

I’m just going to focus the rest of senior year getting use of my leg back and getting out of here.  Josh sucks and I can’t believe I dated that loser.

Edit 2: Wow, the comments here.  I stand by my choice.  Fuck Josh.  Fuck my school.  I'm going to be graduating in eight months and moving onto better things.  He had it coming when his xbox got confiscated.  Maybe he'll learn to be a better boyfriend.

WIBTA for asking for a refund of my speeding ticket to my fellow student project members?,"Title alone sounds a bit mad I know but let me explain.

As a graduating project we had to found a student company in order to learn the daily business life in practice. Goal is to gain as much profit as possible to fund our graduation trip, so everyone is quite motivated. A few months back we had a teambuilding activity, I drove together with some team member to and from the teambuilding location. A few weeks later I get a speeding ticket from that night, not a severe one but still 62€ I have to pay from my own account. I didn’t even doubt that this ticket would be my responsibility so I paid it. Although it did suck that I got the ticket because of the teambuilding since it was in a region where I wasn’t familiar with the speed limits.
Now to my problem, a few weeks ago, one of our team members (our CEO) had to unload something from his car at school for our project. He parked on a handicap spot since there was no other free space (mind you it’s on school property) for about half an hour to unload. In between unload sessions, we suddenly see that his car got towed. An old guy called a tow truck because my team mate was parked on a handicap spot (there were other handicap parking spots still available).
Result, he got a 300€ fine. Our professors tried to have our school pay for the fine since it’s a large amount for a student, but with no success. 

Last week we got the notification that the fine would be split between the student himself and our student company, since he got the fine because he was unloading for an activity of the company. Mind you this is 150€ profit gone which means that every student will have to pay a bit more for the trip. No one protested when this was put forth but I felt bad about it (I was in quarantine at that moment so couldn’t really protest). Today another team member told me that I should adress the fact that I had to pay my speeding ticket from the teambuilding myself without splitting it with the company. 

Now I’m kinda torn and I don’t know if I should adress it on the next meeting. On one hand, we did agree on procedures at the beginning of the project that all fines would not be refunded by the company if it was your own fault. On the other hand, I still have to go on a 17 day trip with this team so I don’t want to cause a scene.

AITA for Telling My Coworker She’s Jealous and Insecure?,"I (21f) work with a girl, let’s call her V (18f). About two days ago I wasn’t wearing makeup to work. For some context, I am very insecure without makeup. It’s probably the biggest insecurity I have and I try to avoid going makeup-free usually as I constantly feel like people are judging me. V comes into work and immediately asks if I feel okay, I say yeah I’m fine. She then proceeds to tell me that I look like shit not once but twice. I was shocked. I said I’m not wearing makeup and all she said was oh okay, no apology or anything. I gathered my thoughts and tell her a few minutes later that what she said was fucked up. She denied saying it and said I sound like shit, which is untrue, I wasn’t sick at all. I immediately felt crushed. It really sucked going to work makeup-free and being told I look like shit. I was so embarrassed and insecure I could barely work. I told my manager and an incident report was filed. A few days pass and of course we are the only two girls working together in the store. She tried to be nice when I came in but I didn’t give her the time of day. I spent the night she told me that bawling and very upset. It really hurt having my biggest insecurity pointed out like that. Because of this, I could not keep my cool with her. When no customers were around I told her how rude it was to say that and not apologize and that she was a jealous and insecure person. I was literally shaking with anger and telling her “how could you f****** say say that to anyone.” I was so upset she asked me to calm down. Both my parents and my boyfriend think I’m the a-hole for raging at her. And to be clear I was very, very pissed. I usually can control my anger but this pushed me over the edge. She left early and now I don’t know if I’m the a-hole. Also, yes I know being this insecure is why lashed out, but is it okay to go around telling your coworkers they look like shit knowing they have no makeup on?

AITA for vaping in a shared bedroom?,"**Background**

I (25F) live with three other women (**A, B, C**) in a 2-bed apartment in a high COL city in the US. We're all grad students, and two people share one room to reduce individual rent expenses. I share my room with **A.**

I used to smoke cigarettes. I switched to vapes and lowered the nicotine concentration over time, and I'm at the stage where I can soon quit since I barely even crave it anymore. **A** (25F) also vapes, but she doesn't do it in our room because she claims she doesn't like the smell. So I don't do so either, to respect her wishes.

**A** is overall a terrible person. Roommates **B**, **C**, and I get along really well. **A** has conflicts with everyone. For example, she never cleans up after herself. She has damaged several items that didn't belong to her and has refused to replace or pay for them. We have 2 baths in our apartment, and the state she leaves the bathrooms in after using them has resulted in us asking her to use one specific bathroom at all times, and the three of us share the other one. (Blood on toilet seats when she's on her period, hair everywhere, stained TP lying on the floor instead of being flushed, etc). We barely speak to her. We're just waiting for the lease to end since we aren't in a position to terminate it at the moment.

I don't drink coffee. **A** does. I never eat or drink in the bedroom, unlike **A,** who always does it. I have repeatedly asked her not to eat in the room because she leaves the soiled plates/bowls under her bed for days and our room starts to smell after a few hours. I've been the one to take these dishes and load them in the dishwasher many times because I know she'll never do it. 

&#x200B;

**Story**

All of us take turns cleaning the whole apartment every week or two. **A** hasn't done this at all. Ever. I had been asking her to clean our shared room for 2 months, but she didn't do it. So I did it last week after the state of the carpets disgusted me.

A few days back, I came back from class to notice a huge stain on the carpet on my side of the bed. I asked her what it was, and she claimed to not know. I sniffed the stain, and it smelled like coffee. **B** was walking past my room and commented that she saw **A** trip and fall this morning while holding a mug of coffee. **A** then appeared to suddenly remember it and said, ""oh yeah, sorry, my bad"".

I asked **A** to try to clean it ASAP, and she said that since it was on my side of the room, she's not going to clean it. WTF?

&#x200B;

**Here's where I might be the asshole**

**I just shrugged and said OK. And then I immediately started vaping in the room. She asked me to stop, and I didn't even acknowledge her. This has been going on for 3 days now, and today she screamed at me and called me a shitty roommate.**

AITA for accidentally running a stop sign and taking an abrupt left turn while my dad berated me?,Ok so something happened today that is making me feel like the worst person alive. Basically I’m a new driver so I’ve only been driving for probably a month or so. I am 18 btw. Today I went to go pick up my brother with my dad in the passenger seat and idk what got into me today but I missed a stop sign sort of and stopped a little too late. It was near my house so there was no cars at all. My dad erupted on me and was super demeaning abt it. He said things like “why do you take life so easy?” “Why do people put so much effort in you and you still are a failure?”. I definitely felt bad cuz I knew it was my fault. I totally get how that could have been dangerous had there been cars around. I was really shaken by his voice. My dad was on the phone with someone the entire rest of the time so I had no fucking clue where to go so when we got to the building he told me to take a left turn literally right as I was there. I panicked and took a sharp left which was a little frightening but I made it ok. My dad got so pissed and started grilling me even though he wasn’t giving me directions in advance. I know I put everyone in a unsafe environment and I feel bad and I apologized repeatedly for it. My dad now has no trust in me driving despite the fact that I normally do okay except when he’s in the car. Im just really scared of him so I get really anxious and stuff when I drive with him.

AITA for going low contact with my grandpa after he didn’t promote my fiancé?,"My (26F) grandpa owns auto dealerships. My fiancé  27M works for him. He’s worked for my grandpa for the last 4 years. We have been together since middle of high school and he knows my family very well. 

I’m going to try to make this as simple as possible. My grandpa promised my fiancé a promotion at the end of the year. My fiancé was using PTO for a bachelor party for one of his very good friends at the end of November. The PTO was approved and he went on the trip. 

Fast forward to now and suddenly my grandfather is walking back the promotion because of the bachelor party. My grandfather told us that they had a really rough month of November and December is a bad month too. His words: my fiancé, instead of “going to get drunk at a bachelor party” should have realized the struggling business and not gone to the bachelor party so he could help out at the store. He said my fiancé “isn’t as dedicated to the business like I thought he was since he’d rather party than be here.” 

My grandpa adores me as I’m his only granddaughter so I knew I had some leverage here. I told him that I am not interested in communicating with him until he gives my fiancé what he promised. He went into some lecture about being a “company man” and how friends and activities like that should never come before his job. I brought up how his time off was cleared but he replied with another “he knew we were struggling and he went anyways”. 

I am standing firm with not really talking to him and I’ve had other family reach out to me on his behalf. A lot of my older relatives are saying my grandfather was right and my fiancé blew the promotion when he prioritized the bachelor party. Younger cousins and my parents are siding with me and think what my grandpa did was rotten. I still have 0 plans to talk to him until the promotion is given.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for destroying a friendship over $50?,"'m a 19m college student who is adamant about not paying back my friend. 

Essentially, last Thursday night me and my friends went to the club. I am the only one of my friends that has a fake so I paid for liquor for our pre-game. I have a spare fake that my friend (19m) requested from me and since we look alike, he can get drinks with it. I gave it to him with the agreement that he buys me a drink there. 

While at the club, I request for the drink and he gives me his card, which I buy a drink with and give it back to him, upon which he says that the card is mine for the night. I assume that means that the rest of the drinks are on him, and this makes sense to me on the basis that he has paid for my drinks when going clubbing before and once spent $200+ dollars giving friends drinks at the club. I proceed to buy 2 more drinks. 

He claims to have given me the fake he borrowed back to me while we exited the club. I have no memory of this. Both me and him were drunk, but my girlfriend who was half as drunk as us and who was with me the whole time says she has no memory of him giving me the fake back. Considering both me and her have no memory of him doing this, I have a heavy suspicion that he didn't actually give the fake back, but he claims he 100% did. 

The next day he requests $50 for the drinks I bought, for some reason even requesting payment the first drink that was 100% free based on our terms. I would just suck it up and pay him under any normal circumstance but the fact that he doesn't want to pay me back for the lost fake, claiming for certain that he gave it back to me, makes me outright refuse to give him any money.

Not giving him the money would likely destroy our friendship but at this point idc. He has numerous things about his personality that annoy me plus he has been touchy with my girlfriend in ways that frustrate both me and her profusely, so we don't mind cutting ties with him.

I have a group chat with me my friend and one other friend who isn't relevant in this story. when i found the tweet i sent it to our group chat in which i was like ""what do we do how do you bring this up to someone??"" as we were discussing it and i got confirmation it was indeed our mutual friend, we were wondering how to approach this. i wanted to approach it as a group so we could have power in numbers in case the friend lashed out, as well as reassuring him since this was pretty heavy already. my friend decided she was just going to dm him right then instead of waiting to which i said ""i wish you would've waited instead of just doing it."" this is where things get messy, she gets mad and starts ranting and raving about how ""we needed to do it now because the tweet is already viral and gaining traction"" and she needed to tell him because ""he's the victim in this."" i responded to both of those things saying he isn't going to ask his ex to delete the tweet anyway as well as many other accounts have already posted the screenshots too so the traction from that tweet is always going to be there. also he isn't the victim technically because his ex posted the way he emotionally abused her 2 years ago, sure it sucks to be put on blast especially when you aren't that person anymore but still. it was at this point she tried to abandon the argument by saying she's done with me until i get my meds adjusted since she just ""can't fucking handle me"" right now and has ""much better things to deal with."" saying that is already kind of out of line to me but whatever, i start going back and forth with her just repeating what she says back at her, eventually she goes ""some of us have more important things to deal with than a shitty boyfriend."" it's important to note i had told her about my relationship troubles in confidence since i was struggling and needed an outside opinion. i admit in my anger at her personally attacking me i responded with a personal attack at her too also adding that me and my boyfriend are fine (we are, this wasn't a lie.) she then goes ""yeah because what you told me last night sounded sooo fine, i feel sorry for [boyfriend name] fr.""

AITA For Getting Mad Because My Brother Didn't Like My Gift,"My brother's birthday was last month and I wanted to give something to him, but I didn't know what to give until the last week of January when he mentioned the his mousepad sucked and he was thinking of buying a new one. So as any other person would do, I ordered a new mousepad for him, but not any mousepad, I bought for him a personalized one with a drawing of us and our friends as valorant characters(we play it a lot together) and it took two weeks or so to the drawing to be done and two more weeks to the mousepad to arrive at my house. That was gonna be a surprise for him and me, my mom and all our friends were hiding this from him, for obvious reasons, but one of our friends kinda gave way the surprise when my brother asked him about buying a new mousepad and he didn't now how to answer. So my brother confronted me about it and as much as I tried to negate it he really did found out about and I couldn't hide it anymore, so I just said the truth to him and he just said the he didn't like surprises and to don't do more of them and I let at that, but I was kinda disappointed that my surprise didn't work as intented, but I thought that would been fine since he would like the mousepad at least, he said that he liked the drawing, so that's why I thought that. So the mousepad came, but what also came is his mouse that he bought(Logitech Superlight) and he was way more excited for his mouse than my mousepad, which is fair, but he didn't even said thank you. But when I got back from work I was really excited to play with him and test his mousepad with him, I noticed that he was using his old one and what he said about the mousepad I gave to him made me really mad, he said that the mousepad was shit, that the texture was shit and the the material was trash and wasn't worth the price I payed for($40) and he went back to his old one wich is all small(60X40cm) while the one I bought for him is much larger (90X40cm) and the old one has a lot of coffee stains and the texture is the the same(I used both) and although the material of the new one isn't the best, you don't really notice when playing. But that isn't why I'm mostly mad about, it's the fact that HE USED IT LESS THAN A DAY, the mousepad came at 12:30 and my shift starts at 1:30pm and ends at 5:30pm, so he used for 5 hours max. After all that happened, I got really mad and complained with my mom about and now he can't buy a mousepad until he's 18(he's 16 now) and he has to pay me back the money I spent with the mousepad, but now I'm ignoring him as much as possible and not talking with him in general, my mother said that there's no reason to do this and he got what he deserved.

WIBTA if I call out my SIL for trying to uninvite my BF to my brother's official wedding?,"This is something that just came to light last night, im on mobile and I'm still pissed so please excuse any grammar errors.

I have been with my BF ""Dean"" for over a year and a half. He is everything to me and I'm everything to him. He helped me gain the courage to get mental help and to straighten myself out, become less of a doormat, etc. I see myself possibly and more than likely being with him for the rest of my life and he feels the same.

My brother, ""Roger"" and his wife, ""Emma"" are already married but her and her family wanted a big wedding which they are doing this next year in the summer.

I called my mom like usual after work since she lives in another state and she keeps me sane while driving home. Due to the weather this last weekend I couldn't make it up to her place for Christmas as it is a 5 and a half hour drive for me. But my two brothers and their SOs are there.

She told me that Emma was trying to not invite Dean to the wedding since we aren't married, aren't fiancés, and apparently aren't living together? We are and have been living together for a while. But these same parameters don't go for my other brother and his GF. My father caught wind of it and he too said that Dean was going if he could and she would be wrong to not invite him. My mother told Emma and Roger that if Dean was not invited, she wouldn't go and that she wasn't going to be paying for the rehearsal dinner.

When I heard it from my mom, I did say some choice words that I'm not too proud of but I was angry. Like I said, I support my brother fully but she has changed him. We all three bonded (brothers and I) over a shitty divorce and a sucky upbringing and now he doesn't even call me once in a while like he used to. It feels like I'm losing my brother, but I suck it up because he seems happy and I want him to be happy.

I told Dean and he now doesn't want to go even though my mom smoothed it over and made sure he was invited.

Now onto the issue, no one but my mom knows that me and Dean know about the uninvited to invited issue. I dont think I can bring myself to be civil at our Christmas celebration this weekend at my Dad's place. I know Dean won't pretend he doesn't know, but I honestly don't know if I should bring it up at all. I want to, everytime I think about it my blood boils.

I just want an apology, a heartfelt apology, but I know I'll never get one. I might still back out of going to the wedding over this, it will break my heart because my brother probably won't talk to me ever again if I dont go. But I can't just let this go.

So WIBTA if I were to basically cause a scene this weekend with my SIL? I'm fully prepared for the fallout but I don't want to ruin our Christmas celebration especially since this is the first time in a long while all the ""kids""(us) are together in one place again.

WIBTA if I (22F) blame my boyfriend (22M) for the reason that I’m not having a good college experience?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for two years. Less than a year into our relationship he left for bootcamp but was not able to graduate due to unforeseen circumstances and had to come home. When he came home we decided we would finally transfer out of CC and planned to transfer to one school and rent an apartment/a room in a house for the duration of our time there. This was all good and fine but I started having doubts and expressed with him that I may want to go to a different school and/or that we should rent separate places for the first year and regroup for the following school year. However, he would always get upset because “[moving to this certain school and renting together] is the plan! This is what we’ve been working so hard towards!” Which I find to be understandable, but I always felt like we couldn’t just take one option and run with it- I felt like we should keep our minds open to other options. Ultimately I decided to stick with the plan.

Fast forward to now, we attend the same school and are renting a townhouse with a couple of other people as we share a room together. Now that I am here, and a full semester later (now starting my second semester), I have been feeling like this school is not for me at all. The department sucks, and so do the advisors/counselors, which could be universal for all schools but I keep getting fucked over. I might take 3 years instead of 2 to graduate because the advisors keep messing up my schedules and always giving me wrong information. Aside from that, he wants to spend all of our time together because he has trouble making friends and has made 0 friends in our 6 months living in this area. When I want to go do something he’ll say he wants to be part of it too (clubs, etc.) but will be complaining the entire time that it’s not his type of thing to do. It’s making it very difficult not to resent him because I feel he cornered me to be in this position, but I do know that I’m responsible for decisions that I make. Every time he says he’s here to help in whatever way he can, I just want to tell him that I blame him because I felt like he guilted me into sticking with the plan and not exploring other options due to the fact that he was just “excited to live with [me]” and that everything up to this point has held me back. In terms of school he’s doing much better because his advisors and counselors are quite helpful and for that he’s on track to graduate on time and not behind. Now, if I blame him that I’m not on the same boat WIBTA?",Everyone Sucks
AITA for throwing my wife's phone out the window because she wouldn't stop texting her friend while we're at the cottage?,"Still at the cottage and my wife isn't talking to me. It's not even our cottage, it's my parents' and we were supposed to be here to work on our marriage because we've been having issues. Not huge issues, but issues. Nobody's cheated or gambled all our money or anything. But she couldn't stop messaging her fucking ""writing friend."" All they do is talk about their characters or roleplay them with each other. My wife is looking for a serious career in writing, and she is a great writer, but this is literally just for fun. She's never going to publish this gay dark academia borderline fanfiction she's writing, and she knows it (this isn't my opinion, she's said this). I mean I would still be pissed with her working while we're supposed to be spending time together, but this is worse. I told her I wanted her to focus on me and our relationship, and she said she would, she's just had a new stream of ideas she can't control. Which again, I could excuse if this was publishable stuff, but it's just her and her friend pretending to be two university students in love.

But I did something really shitty. I tried to initiate with her last night, and she rejected me, which is fine because it happens obviously, nobody's in the mood all the time, but then she just went right on her phone fucking roleplaying these guys. I grabbed her phone and threw it out the window. The phone is fine, she has a good case (which I knew, I wasn't trying to break it), but she called me a piece of shit and a ton of other things and isn't speaking to me today.

AITA for telling my friend her sister sucks?,"So me and two friends, ill call them A and L, had to meet up at school and film something for our shops class. A brought her sister along and im not really a big fan of her but i was being nice. Anyways it was really cold outside and we had a place where we could film indoors on Friday so we decided to postpone it until then. We were just messing around playing tag etc. When A’s sister starts throwing snow in my face for no reason. I then take her toque and me and L are throwing it around but she starts fake sulking and we have to give it back. We try playing a bunch of other games with my volleyball that i had brought for filming but we have to keep changing the games cause A’s sister wouldn’t play properly and would get upset when we told her she was wrong. She keeps being annoying, and i just start pretending that she isnt there. In our schools playground their are four square boxes painted on the concrete and we decide to play four square. A’s sister kept trying to get me and my L out but not A. A’s sister got me out and in four square if your out you would go to the back of the line, but since no one else was there we would just rotate squares. I was tired of A’s sister and said that they could play 2 square (not acknowledging A’s sister) and sat out. They continued playing and when it was over A’s sister threw snow in my face or threw the ball at me or something but i was done with her so i asked L if she wanted to leave and get gelato now. She said yes and my sister drove us to the gelato place next to my school, cause we didn’t want to walk there and back. When we were walking up to the door of the gelato place A and her sister came out and i made a snarky comment, and asked them why they were there, because they were going to go to the tim hortons, which was a building over. She said that her sister wanted gelato and they left. Later A texted  us and asked what happened. I was like wdym and she said that i didn’t seem happy when i saw her and her sister at the gelato place and i told her i wasnt cause her sister sucks. I told my mom what happened and she thinks that I shouldn’t have said that. Btw the sister is a year younger than us and knows better, and shes done stuff like this before, when i was roller skating with A, she was trying to trip me and was throwing candy at my head, so Aita? update, we tried filming again, and A brought her sister, and her sister was calling me and L psycho bitches, and got my volleyball stuck on the roof.

AITA for embarrassing my husband and MIL when she tried to meddle in my marriage?,"We had to temporarily move in with MIL and it sucks because she thinks she gets a vote on everything. She critiques my parenting, my marriage, how I dress. She doesn't even like the food I cook for my husband. It's really hard on our marriage and makes me want to get the fuck out of here.

Recently my husband and I had a pretty big fight. I'm aware it is immature that we fought loud enough MIL could hear, but I was just heated because he played a ""prank"" and squirted me with the hose through a window while I was using the toilet, and I felt so degraded and disrespected.

MIL decided to butt in and tell us how much our marriage sucks. she said I'm so miserable and uptight that if she was married to me she would cheat, and she feels bad for her son for having to be with someone so miserable. She said I should work on myself because no man is going to put up with that.

I asked if she would like to be married to her son and she just rolled her eyes. Now I might be the asshole here, but I said I actually don't think she would. If they were two random people who met on the street, she would 100% say he isn't good enough for her. I've seen the men she is with. Her standards are sky high, so she should shut the fuck up. I could see my husband was mortified. I know he already has some insecurities. 

I then said I didn't even want her advice because she cheated on her first husband. MIL told me to fuck off and said I have no idea what happened in her first marriage. I might also be the asshole because MIL's stepkids heard this and now they have more shit to talk about her. After they left MIL called me a misogynist and asked if I seriously thought her first husband never cheated on her, and said I need to mind my own business.

AITA for telling my wife to stop being a jealous bitch,"Both my wife (f31) and I(m32) work in the tech industry. We graduated from the same university with the same degree, and work for the same company. Where we differ is within the company, I opted to go down the management route, and her down a more technical route. For one reason or another, she has not gotten a promotion or (proper) raise in nearly 2 years, which has led to a bit of an income imbalance between us where I currently earn double what she does.                                      

I’ve felt a bit of jealousy from her side, but I’ve always chalked up to her competitive attitude. She’s made jokes in the past regarding how the only reason I earn more than her is because I’m a man (my direct superior is a woman) and how I’m fortunate I’m a good talker because I would otherwise not be as successful (true).                                                                                       This all culminated to a bit of what I thought was banter (it was not) last week where she said she was smarter than me and I kept making dumb comments ( things like “man smart woman dumb haha”) which agitated her further. She then spent the next several hours making me take those dumb online IQ tests until I intentionally failed one which pissed her off even more. Then this past weekend she “had a surprise” for me (which was an official IQ test).                                                                                    

We got the results yesterday and imagine the scenes when I scored higher. She was obviously infuriated, and kept saying dumb shit which I kept laughing off until she called me a “fucking drug baby”. My bio mom was a drug addict and I’ve had no relationship with her since I was 5 (she died before I turned 18). This upset me more than it should (considering she wasn’t really wrong) and I in turn resorted to calling her a “dumb jealous bitch”. She has not spoken to me since and is sleeping in a guest bedroom tonight. I think I’m justified in my actions but I do feel bad that I used her insecurities against her in the heat of the moment.

AITA for insisting my girlfriend come home from a picnic after my dad had a stroke?,"This morning, I had to get a new phone because my screen on my old phone got broken to where I couldn't see anything on it.  My girlfriend had drunkenly planned a picnic with some old work friends a few nights ago and was going this afternoon.  After she left, I was trying to power down my old phone to swap the sim out, but wasn't able to, so I took it apart and unplugged the battery.  After swapping the SIM into my new phone, I turned it on and started the setup process.  


Not long after the phone came online, a few texts came in.  One was from a family group text, and it said that my father had a stroke.  I immediately went into a panic and texted my girlfriend: ""My dad had a stroke"".  I immediately got the read receipt and sat there staring for a good 15 minutes in shock.  I eventually snapped out of it, but was still very much panicking, so I called her.  She claimed not to have seen the text and said she was helping to unload things from the car.  I told her what had happened and she said ""oh shit"" and then just went quiet.  It was just silence for a while, then she asked me what details I knew.  I said none, so she said she would come home soon and that I should call her when I know more.  


I wasn't able to reach anyone for another 30 minutes and I was panicking again, so I called and told her that I needed her and asked if she was on her way.  She had started drinking and was asking me to give her another hour.  I got upset and told her that my dad just had a stroke and I'm not doing well and I need her, but she just kept insisting that if she left, her friend would be there alone, because everyone else was late.  I insisted, that no, this was literally a medical emergency that is potentially life threatening, and that her friend would be fine in a public park for a few minutes while everyone else got there.  She got angry and refused.  I finally said ok, but if people got there before an hour, that she needed to come home.  She agreed.  


Right after we hung up, she texted asking if I knew where my dad was or what was going on.  I was upset, and it seemed to me like she was trying to gauge the severity of the situation to see if she could justify not coming at all.  I replied by asking why she was even asking if it wasn't important enough to leave a picnic.  After some arguing through text, she revealed that actually everyone had been there, and they were just waiting for the sunset.  I got really upset then, and then she turned that on me and said she was too afraid to come home.  


Some context: My car was totaled a few months ago and I haven't been able to get a new one, so we've been sharing hers, so now I'm just stuck at home unable to go to where my dad is after he's just had a stroke.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for refusing to eat the dinner my mom cooked last night after telling her I'm switching to a different diet?,"So I, 17F, recently made the decision to switch to a meat restricted type diet for ethical reasons. The thought came to me while being hungover and unable to stomach bacon. IMO meat doesn't taste good. It's the seasonings, sauce, fat, and oil that makes it taste good. And then, after watching the Dominion documentary on YouTube and crying myself to sleep I decided I was mostly done with exceptions. 

The sole reason of me switching but allowing myself fish, eggs, and game is because I do not want to contribute to an abusive and corrupted meat farming industry. My stepdad hunts game and enjoys fishing, so I will eat that because I know those animals have had long and healthy lives in nature, free, and die quickly. My mom buys free range eggs from her friends farm, they are truly free range, and I would eat her chicken because I've seen how they butcher them, but we didn't get any chickens this year. They are not suffering constant abuse and painful deaths in overcrowded animal farming warehouses, tolerating abuse from workers, often unsuccessful butchering techniques, etc. Overall though, I really hate the idea of needing to kill other beings in order to sustain our own lives.

I got home yesterday from work, started talking to my mom, asked her what was for dinner, she told me chicken and alfredo. I shot her a look. My sister laughed in my face but I ignored it. I looked in the kitchen, it was separated, fine. I went upstairs to clean my room, came down for dinner, a chicken thigh was sitting on my plate. I took it and dropped it right back with the full rotisserie chicken sitting in the middle of the table and said, ""I'm not eating this.""

My mom clapped back with, ""yes. You are."" She put it back on my plate and I put it right back, put a serving of pasta on my plate and sat down. She said fine, and took the entire pot of pasta off the table and told me I wasn't eating anything else for the rest of the night.

I never eat breakfast or pack lunch to work so the first time I'm eating is often dinner, and then I'll snack on like fruit, cashews, almonds or pistachios in the evening and then have a cup of tea before bed. She started arguing with me about how I'm just going to end up binge eating and me restricting meat is more harmful and less sustainable to the environment and I should just suck it up, and I don't understand how expensive produce is so I can't be eating it all to make up for not having meat.. (before this she was throwing out fruits and veggies bc me and my sister weren't eating them fast enough). She also said she would not support an unhealthy lifestyle with me filling up with just carbs, (when that's the only option I had for last night) so I quickly finished my pasta and went up to my room for the rest of the night.

WIBTA/If I stopped paying rent,"I (39f) and my child (7) with my sister (36f) and her family (33m, 4m, 1f) in their house. It was supposed to be my house after I sold mine 11 years ago to move in to this house to help care for our grandmother. At the time I was married and planning a family and my sister was a single nomad who would come by randomly and we would gladly let her stay and feed her. After our grandmother passed away our father who owned the home backed out on helping me get my own place for my child and I. Eventually he sold it to my BIL for a good price and the side deal was for my child and I to remain here and pay rent (which I gladly done) while we all live under one roof.

Over the last few years my sister and BIL have had their kids who I love, however now their family is double the size of mine. We spilt expenses mostly 50/50, but I have been pushing back that it should be more by thirds since they use more food, electricity (they have a home nanny and my sister works from home, whereas my child is at school and I work out of the house 10 hours a day). I also clean up after my child and I, however I refuse to clean up after them as they let their kids run wild and trash the house including our bedrooms. 

Originally I was told the amount of rent I was paying was only covering a third of the mortgage (and I do not receivable equity, and they have made it repeatedly clear that they were doing me a huge favor). Recently I saw the mortgage bill (it was left in the open) and I’m paying half of the mortgage for use of essentially two rooms. I have decided that since they lied to me and refuse to adjust expenses accordingly that I’m going to stop paying rent and instead save it to use towards a down payment on a place for my child and I. It’s already been an unpleasant situation so I think this is justified given the lies and how they treat us. I figure it will take them time to evict us and then I’ll have enough for the down payment. WIBTA?",Everyone Sucks

AITA for telling my friend his life sucks and he needs psychiatric help,"AMTA for telling my friend my life is better then his and that he needs psychiatric help ?

Hi every one , I’m a  skater/filmer who currently lives in Barcelona.


For context Barcelona is seen as the best skateboarding city in the world.


I’ve currently been living there for two years, with a very chill, good paying, accessible job.


A friend( 24) from my home country came to visit me twice, he’s very talented on the board and I filmed him a LOT, by this I mean hours of sitting down or following him with my skateboard and my admittedly heavy camera, yes it’s fun, but it’s work, it’s time invested.


My (Stoner) friend is frequently unemployed and lives at his parents place, I had many Job opportunities for him , and I knew he loved the city, so I naturally tried to help him settle, but he was lazy and went back to his parents place, jobless again.

The footages I have of him were meant to be in a big video , with all of our common friends, it’s an important project for me, and I’ve been working hard to make it the best I can, I’m not working for a brand, so I don’t have any deadlines what so ever.

Recently he started pressuring me about releasing the video, I told him he had to be patient, that my other friends were still not satisfied with what  they had and neither was I, very frequently he would call me lazy for not doing the edit.

But one day he told me straight up to 
«just release the video caus it would suck anyway and no one will want to watch it ».

I told him that’s no way to speak to a friend and that he should  apologize, but he only got angrier, called me homophobic slurs and other nasty things. 


So at this point I lost it, i told him that he as a jobless adult who still lives at his parents place, could not say these kind of things to someone who’s life is obviously better then his, that he needed psychiatric help because his anger management was awful and that he would loose me as a friend. 

After this, I stopped answering, he kept sending messages, mostly mean ones, partly because I still had some footages of him that he needed.

But he never apologized, and at this point I was over it.
He ended up releasing all of the footages on Instagram without crediting my filming. 


Was I the asshole for the way I talked to him ? 

Tl; DR : 

filmed a lot of skateboarding

AITA for making my mom return my Christmas gift?,"My mom always gets the best gifts. It has been a big point of contention in my marriage for years as my wife feels that my mom should be getting gifts for her kids partners as we are older and in relationships. It took me an embarrassingly long time to realize she was right because that was just so foreign to me and i felt super uncomfortable when my in laws gave me gifts.

Last year I hinted at something my wife really wanted and hoped my mom would get it, but this year I decided to set a firm boundary and not accept any gifts from my mom unless she also has gifts for my family (wife and 1.5 year old son) Now I take full accountability here. I fucked up and didn't have the conversation with my mom. I really did mean to, but life just got in the way and it didn't cross my mind until we arrived. She had my dream gift. I've been wanting a snowmobile for a couple years now and she got me one. I knew it was going to suck but there was nothing for my wife or son, so I pulled her aside and said I couldn't accept it.

She seemed really confused and said she shouldn't have to buy gifts for my wife and called it weird. She said my son is only 1.5 and won't even notice. I told her I was sorry and it was an amazing gift but she was going to have to return it. She was frigid the rest of the night and wouldn't even say goodbye. Her brother's wife pulled me aside and told me I was completely inappropriate and she would never expect my grandma to buy her anything. My uncle married her. No one else in the family did.

AITA for telling my dad his cooking sucks?,"(Im on mobile so please pardon the formatting)

For a bit of context ive been learning to cook since i was 14(im 16 now) so i think i might be a good cook. My father however is not. To put it straight his cooking is not good.
Last night my mom and dad were out late working so i made food for myself and them. When they came home they were delighted to see that i made them food.
However as soon as he took a bite out of the food he started complaining about how there was excessive salt and how it didnt taste good at all. I was saddened to hear that cuz i made that food as good as i could. He then said"" I could make better food than this in half an hour"". Now this is where i think i might be the asshole. In the heat of the moment i said"" Your cooking sucks dad no one likes it.""
Then i got up and went to my room. Today when i woke up and went downstairs mom said Dad thought that his cooking was great(everytime he cooked mom told me to say it was good). Turns out my mom agreed with me and they argued about it. Now he is giving me the cold shoulder telling me that im an asshole and that i couldve just prepared something else and not insult him like that.

So reddit aita?

Update: Last night my dad came home and he still didnt talk to me. But i apologized for what i did saying that me lashing out was bad. He then apologized to me for not talking to me and that he shouldve appreciated what i cooked for him.
However he still thinks he cooks good and that I only said his cooking was bad cuz he insulted mine. I have now proposed a cook off.
He accepted it so this saturday were gonna have a cook off and the judges will be my best friend and his dad( my dads best friend).
Now its all good. Thanks to everyone who replied :)",Everyone Sucks
AITA for eating most of my sister’s cake?,"so on Saturday it was my sisters 16th birthday and my parents wanted to host a birthday party for her.

we went to a bowling alley, and invited our cousins and her friends. the venue was great, I really liked the curly fries there but the thing that i didn’t like was my sisters friends.

they have bullied me for years. it’s because I don’t have the same similarities as my sister. i’m overweight while my sisters body is the shape of one of those bikini model you see on the magazine. my sister is pretty, big lips and all that. i look ugly, i have acne all over me and everything. they’ve bullied me for that basically.

in the party they made fun of me for missing the bowling pins a lot of times, they blamed it because of my weight. on the other hand, my sister is a pro at bowling. sometimes I think i’m adopted.

my sister is bullying me along with them because I think she is trying to fit in with them, but I’m not really sure

I enjoyed bowling with my cousins whilst I tried to ignore them but anyways after about an hour it was time to cut the cake. the cake wasn’t large but that didn’t bother me

the portion I ate was bigger than everyone else’s, my parents knew I wanted a big portion of cake, it was so damn tasty. unfortunately when I finished eating my sister and her friends came up to me and started laughing, one of them said “are you trying to be Lizzo, because I can definitely see it” I knew she was talking about my weight, I just knew it.

I ended up crying and they quickly ran away because they didn’t want to be seen, my mum and dad came up to me asking what’s wrong, I told them they’re bullying me because of my weight, and my dad told me to just ignore them, and my mum got me a larger portion of cake to cheer me up

because I ate two large portions of cake, some people didn’t get to even eat one small piece of cake, because the cake wasn’t big. my parents ended up giving the people who didn’t get to eat any cake an extra gift bag, but they weren’t mad at me.

when we got home, my sister was mad at me saying I embarrassed her for eating most of the cake (which is why I think i’m the AH for ruining her party).

AITA for wanting to sleep in my room and making my brother and his wife sleep separately?,"So, during the quarantine my brother (33M) and his girlfriend Melanie (32F) were staying at home with us and that was fine, at first. I told them to sleep in my bedroom, since I have a double bed and he doesn't, and they accepted it. My brother doesn't have the bigger room because he left home years ago to live with his then girlfriend, so when he came back he got the smaller room. The problem started when they decided to STAY in my room like... forever. They stopped asking me if they could and slowly started moving their stuff. He said once jokingly that I had the room during the day and he had it during the night, but the thing is - THAT'S NOT EVEN TRUE!! My mom stayed in my room during the day because it was ""more quiet for her to work"" and I couldn't use my bedroom for literal MONTHS because every time I would say anything to my parents they quietly told me to suck it up and ""they're going to move out soon"". I couldn't even use my bathroom and had to move my stuff to the half bathroom downstairs. They eventually left and I got the room back. 

After the pandemic, I moved to another place country and started college there. My parents also moved and now they live in a coastal city to enjoy their retirement. I'm coming home for christmas and so is my brother, his now wife Melanie and their 18 month old baby, Annie. I love my brother and SIL, I love my niece even more, but when my brother started saying shit like ""don't settle into your room just yet"" and ""don't worry, we'll make good use of it"", I lost it. I was so mad, I screamed at him (we were on a facetime call) and melanie also got mad at me, saying that they NEEDED the room way more than I did, because of Annie. I said that if that was the problem Annie was welcome to sleep in my room with me but they can sleep separately for once and suck it up. My brother said I was being a selfish bitch and was going to sleep alone in a double bed while one of them would have to sleep in a mattress on the floor, and said I couldn't take care of Annie properly. I said ""Well I had to deal with you, an adult sized toddler who throws tantrums when he doesn't get his way, my whole life, so I think I'll be fine"". Both my brother and Melanie blocked me and they told my parents. My dad actually defended me and said that it isn't fair for them to take my room when I'm only staying for 2 weeks, but my mom said I was being a brat and it wouldn't kill me to lend my room for some days, since it's not like I'm living there.

I feel bad for snapping at my brother but I also don't want to give up my room, the little time I have home I would like to spend there.

AITA?

EDIT: Sorry for the missing info, I'll try to clear this up: this is the house I grew up in, my parents moved but we are all going back for christmas with the family. 
My room was never my brother's, I was trying to explain why he had the smaller room since he is the older brother. 
If they took my room, I would be sleeping in the office, not another room. Grandma is staying and obviously she gets the other room, sorry for the confusion everyone.

all that said, I do think I might have overreacted lol thank you for bringing some sense into me, I think that because my brother sometimes acts entitled it triggered something in me from last time they did that. I'll let them have the room for baby Annie.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for calling my stepson a loser and telling my wife “if I had it my way he’d be out of the house” ?,"First time user. I’m a 50 year old man. I’m not too familiar with Reddit or social media, I am sorry if I format this wrong. 

I’ve been married to my wife since the fall of 2019. I have 2 boys with my ex wife, both successful, in their late 20s, and married. One has a kid on the way. My wife has one son(Kevin). He’s 20 and lives with us. He and my wife moved in with me after we got married. I have the room because I was alone in the house. 

I have never really seen eye to eye with Kevin. I love sports. My boys excelled at baseball and football in highschool and some college. Kevin is the type that can’t be bothered with sports. Which is okay, but it means one less thing we can bond over. He’s never really seen me as a father figure and I never really saw him as a son. But I provide for him since he lives with us. 

Kevin flunked out of college after his first year (he doesn’t care, his friend is starting a company after college and promised Kevin a job), and has now been fired/quit from his 4th job since. This conversation happened after he was fired again, but I will provide backstory first. 

First job: Target. He quit because his boss yelled at him. I asked why. Because Kevin was late. Kevin sarcastically said target didn’t lose any money for him being 20 minutes late. 

Second job: Starbucks. They wanted him to work some morning shifts, Kevin refuses to wake up before 11 AM. So he quit. 

Third job; a local grocery store. He was fired under the suspicion he was stoned. I believe it. Kid smokes like a chimney. It’s not my place to tell him to stop though. 

Fourth job: a friend of mine hired him on his landscaping crew. He was fired because he was no call/no showing. I was embarrassed because I knew the guy. Apparently Kevin had a problem with being on his phone, when the boss (my friend) corrected him, Kevin said he has no right to tell him what to do with his property. 

After this, I refused to acknowledge Kevin much. Kevin was talking with his mom, (his mom is the most amazing woman I’d ever met) but goes soft on Kevin IMO. She was doing her usual “it’s ok sweetie” routine and my blood boiled. I yelled “NO it’s NOT okay. He’s a Fucking LOSER”. I’ll admit I raised my voice. 

Then I said “Kevin you’re lucky I love your mother with all my heart, because if it was up to me, you’d be out of this house” 

My wife snapped at me, and I responded that Kevin is 20 and needs to start finding a direction in life. He flunked out of college and can’t hold a job that 15 year olds are able to do. I suggested he go spend 2 weeks living with my son, and he would whoop his ass into shape. 

Kevin cried, told me that the worst day of his life was when his mom married me. My wife got very upset with me, which is fair. I flew off the handle. But IMO he has been babied and that’s why he acts this way. I think he needed someone to give it to him straight. 

He even started applying for jobs again after this, so I think my yelling worked. Wife is still angry and wants me to apologize.

Edit: I can’t believe how this has blown up! I won’t be able to read all the responses but here’s an update. I did apologize to Kevin for losing my cool. But I reiterated the importance of trying to find something he wants to do. I told him he doesn’t need his life figured out, but he needs to be working toward something. A bunch of you suggested that we tell Kevin he can go to school or find a job and pay us a small rent. I am trying to get my wife on board with that.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for walking away from my mom,"There is a lot of context needed, me (18m) with my sister (20f) and my mom (56f) all went to the Dallas mall on a vacation trip. I thought we were going to do something at the mall so I agreed to go, when it became apparent that I was just going to be dragged around to look at clothes for 3hours. Naturally I was not a fan, I didn’t vocalize it but it was apparent through my demeanor that I didn’t want to be there. When we finally get back from buying nothing to the car both my mother and sister start yelling at me and calling me an asshole for being a drag. I admit that I had a upsetting demeanor but upon hearing this I argued back that I just thought we were gonna do something and that I specifically did not vocalize my issues. 

When we get back to the hotel my mother has to talk to the receptionist at the front lobby so me and my sister go to the elevator to go to our room. In this elevator my sister further calls me an asshole and stating that “mom was only trying to be nice.” When I attempted to talk to her she gave me the silent treatment and repeatedly said “what? I can’t hear you.” This made me upset so I had to leave the room to get air. 

Que 30 min later when I’m walking back to my room because I was texted that we are gonna go get food and I overhear my mom talking to my sister saying “adams (not my name) little hissy fit doesn’t make anything better, he needs to grow up.” I confronted her about it as we were walking to go get food as a family.

I said “it’s hurtful to hear you talk bad about me to my sister” my mother responded “good.” Upon hearing this I instantly got emotional and left to go back to the hotel. 

Now my mom is calling me an asshole for walking away from her. AITA",Everyone Sucks
"AITA for pointing out that i've realised my wife hugely favourites our son, opposed to her daughters?","I've been with my wife for over 20 years. She had 2 daughters from her previous marriage, and we also have a son together. My wife has always insisted that i stay out of the parenting - when the girls were young i tried to take them on a walk without her and she was furious and since then, i've never tried to be involved. I'm the breadwinner and she's a stay at home mom.

It's come to my attention that my wife plays favourites with our family, and doesn't actually treat her two daughters the same as our son. We have recently fallen out about it and she has told me that she is the parent and knows what she's doing, and I should stay out of it. So i want to ask AITA for noticing these things and pointing them out? I've just realised that the girls are feeling quite neglected. All three children are now adults (all in 20's).

We take my son on holidays and don't invite my daughters at all

My wife is telling the daughters to spend time with their friends over Christmas, rather than come home

My wife insisted my son needed a car so we bought him one, but when her daughters needed cars she was silent (our financial position has always been the same). She then lied to the daughters and said this was a loan to the son.

She cooks foods the daughters don't like, and just says 'tough', whereas makes a special dinner every night for my son

She stirs trouble between the siblings and pits them against one another

She plays favourites and pretends to be each of their best friend's, but then gossips behind their backs with the other siblings

She seems to sabotage the daughters by not giving them the correct instructions for something, then waiting for them to come to her crying as they were unable to do something (but the reason they couldn't do it is because of insufficient instructions!)

AITA for pointing out that these things aren't really what family is all about? I've only just noticed this is all going on, and she's telling me to stay out of it. It's causing tension between us. AITA here?",Everyone Sucks
AITA for not buying my younger sister anything after she said it was wrong for me to use my ex’s card to go shopping?,"I broke up with my ex a month ago and when I tried to return his card to him he told me to keep it because we weren’t over. I didn’t want to keep it so I left it at his house but he sent it back to me.

I was angry at him for sending it back so I decided to do something I’d never done before in the hopes it would make him take the card back. I took my sisters shopping and offered to pay for everything but my younger sister, Allison, told me what I was doing was wrong and I should rethink using his card. I told her he gave me the card because he wanted me to use it, so I was going to but she kept telling me not to.

I bought my other two sisters lots of things but nothing for Allison since I assumed she wouldn’t want to as she kept saying how wrong it was. According to my parents she cried as soon as she got home because I didn’t get her anything and she felt excluded. They think I should take her shopping but now that I’ve calmed down I don’t want to use his card again.

AITA for assuming that a neighbor has stolen my plunger?,"For some context, me (18M) and her (18F) both live in the same university apartment - she on the first floor and me on the third. 

On Friday last week, she asked the building group chat if ""anybody on the first floor [has] a plunger"". I respond, ""I'm on the third floor but i got one"". Later that day, she came to my room and picked it up, easy as pie. For the rest of the day she did not respond via text or in person. Fair enough in my mind, perhaps she had night classes or went to sleep early. 

Before midnight struck I texted her that I would be sleeping and that maybe she could return it tomorrow. Then came Saturday - no response. Fair enough in my mind again, sometimes I don't see notifications for texts, so there's a possibility she couldn't have known (But then again, wouldn't it be reasonable to assume she would approach me if she were intent on returning it?)

Then came Sunday. She texted me back to apologize and say she could return it tomorrow, and I accepted that response.

On Monday, I told her which times I don't have class so that she could have a schedule to drop it off. No response from her for the entire day.

Tuesday is when some suspicions began to arise in me. At 10:00AM she texted the building group chat to ask to be let into the building because she forgot her entrance key. 4 hours later she texted me saying she was in the ER for a foot injury. In the spur of the moment I was shocked and asked if she was okay, but as the day went on I started thinking.

Fast forward to Wednesday - the present. I texted my feelings to her about the situation and preemptively apologized if my assumptions were incorrect. She texted back saying she has a swollen throat and doesn't want anybody to get sick by being around her. It was at this point she offered to send proof and I happily accepted; I also offered to come to her dorm to pick it up instead of the other way around (she didn't respond to this part, and I don't know her room #). The proof was very solid, she sent images of her foot and ER paperwork and I did a reverse image search just in case; it is now beyond a reasonable doubt for me that she is being truthful about her ailments. At last, she told me that she would send a friend to drop it off at my dorm.

Currently, as of me writing this post, I still do not have my plunger back. 

AITA?

For me, I feel like I simultenously am and am not an asshole here, I probably could've waited a few more days; it is just a scarcely used plunger after all (Is it really that big of a deal?), but at the same time it is still mine and if I were to lose it, I would have to buy a new one. It sucks that she's going through this and I hope she recovers soon",Everyone Sucks
AITA for storming out,"I was invited to a very short-notice birthday gathering, we were going for a meal at an expensive restaurant for my very well off friend. I had no intention to go and am broke but decided to go and just 'grin and bear it'. I got her a gift, a £20 bottle of perfume I got on the way there due to the very short notice and lack of funds. I get the cheapest thing on the menu (it was about £70 in total) and enjoy myself. However, then I present my gift and she tried to hide the disappointment and just ignored it and opened another gift but I am furious because she never appreciated it. I ask her what's wrong and she calls my gift 'lousy' and 'cheap' and just carries on. I slam £50 on the table and walk out, as I couldn't deal with her snobbery and her arrogant nature. I have blocked her number and not spoken to her since.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for “scamming” my sister,"My sister (17f) has to write 5 essays by next week for her English class (she had all year to do them but she procrastinated). She kinda sucks at writing but our dad offered to get her a car if she gets straight A’s so she paid me (19f) $100 per paper to do her essays for her. 

I honestly don’t have the time or patience to do the essays for her so I went online to an essay writing service, paid $20-30 for each paper, and kept the extras. 

She got all of her papers back a couple days ago. She turned them in and ended up getting an A. 

My mom is still on my bank account and she can be a little nosy. She saw that I had paid the essay service and asked what that was for. I told her I used them for my sisters essays and she got mad at me for “scamming” her by not doing the essays myself and paying someone 20-30% to do them.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for insisting on taking credit for a product I made?,"My fiancé (late 20s, M) is currently employed part-time and just started going through training (also part-time). I (early 20s F) am working full-time in that role. This work consists of creating products; think graphic design. Recently, his class has been doing a group project competition in groups of 3-5 people for one week starting last Tuesday. He didn't get along with the people he was assigned to work with, so he asked if I could give him some feedback if he decided to do the project on his own. Although this is not 100% accurate to what I do for work, I do have some experience with similar freelance projects, so I agreed, and he registered to do the project by himself.

Initially, I asked if he had any ideas of what he wanted to do so I could help him find the right medium. He said no, so I helped him research possible ideas, the corresponding tools for them, and how to implement them. He agreed with one of the ideas, so he settled on that and registered it for his project. Halfway through, he still has not researched the idea, the tool, or even how to build the product. I became more and more nervous for him, but he kept playing on his phone and said he would do it later, so I got started on my own. I did a very simple structure with the main components and functionalities, as I thought that in case he did not finish his own in time, he could submit this for credit.

Today—less than 24 hours until he has to submit his work—he still hasn't done anything! I showed him what I had created (70% done), but he said he could not understand the material I had created and asked if I could provide a slideshow so he could present this assignment. I agreed to do so once the project was completed. At this point, he mentioned to me that to get additional marks, he would need to publish this project in his portfolio. I refused, stating that he can submit this work internally, but I would publish it in my portfolio as I have completed the entire project up to this point. He then asked if he could change some minor details and then publish it as his; I refused because his changes would be minor in comparison to what I had done, and they would not demonstrate what he had learned in this course.

He got mad and has been ignoring me since, stating that I should not have interjected myself from the beginning and he would have chosen to work in a group, chosen a different idea, and done it himself. He said that I could keep this to myself, that he would not need whatever I came up with, and that he could do better than what I have created. He also blamed me for using my laptop, which meant he didn't have time to borrow it to complete this assignment (he doesn't have his own, so he uses mine for lessons).

I wanted him to win so he could use the cash prize to pay his portion of rent as he was unable to for a few months. I am also paying for this training. So Reddit, AITA for insisting on taking credit or should I have let him use my work?",Everyone Sucks
AITA for being talking crap about my “best friend”?,"Basically I had liked a guy, not realizing he was very manipulative, I would soon find out through his friends that he was using me to get to my best friend. When she had also found out this information she had told me not to worry because she cares to much about our friendship and would never do that to me.

Next thing I know She lies to me twice. First about not liking him and then second on not telling me she liked him  when the day before she told me that she would never get with him, until I found them walking together holding hands. I took the whole situation calmly and at first I never talked shit, how could I? She was so happy and it was working out that she found a guy who likes her too, but then the problems started.

She soon became the girl who was all about her boyfriend, she had completely ghosted me or in other terms started to only come to me when she needed advice or wanted to tell me about her sex life. Which made me horribly uncomfortable because of the fact that I don’t like talking about that type of stuff, it’s private business between the people it happened with why should I know?

Now as that may sound I don’t mind my close friends sharing their sex life with me, but her she was just showing off the things that she was doing and that made me really uncomfortable. So slowly I had started ghosting her.

Then right before christmas, the whole friend group ghosted me and I found out through another mutual friend that she had apparently found out “everything” that I had said. 

She simply removed me from her social medias and we left it like that. Then I found out she had started making more lies and said I was talking crap about the whole friend group I was in with her. I was so confused, the only person I could actually see myself having a problem with is her, but that whole friend group refused to hear my side and are now giving me dirty looks whenever they pass by me and that’s how it’s been for that last couple of days.

I know it’s probably very messy the way I explained this, but there’s a lot that goes into this.

I will take accountability for the fact that I talked shit after I said it was okay. But what i won’t deny is that she became a horrible friend to me and refused to accept the fact that she was wrong for it. Not only that but overlooking the fact that the guy she’s with used her friend to get to her. I know how good it feels to get attention from a guy and feel important, but at the cost of making someone you supposedly care about feel like shit?

Edit: the guy was never my bf but I did tell him I liked him, he told me he didn’t feel the same but started giving me a lot of mixed signals that said the opposite and I had realized that was him keeping me there a bit longer so if the group hung out my best friend would come too. She knew what was happening the whole time as she was one of the people who told me to also stop talking to him. The whole situation was kinda public in my friend group so i didn’t really go around telling everyone what happened, they kinda just formed their own opinions.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for calling my gf racist?,"Hi,

Mg gf and I (both 29) are from Singapore. Here most of the construction worker and road sweeper are foreigners like Bangladeshi and Nepalese. My gf is kind of racist. She would avoid places with a lot of dark skinned foreigners. She said she doesn't like dark skinned people and would avoid countries like India or Bangladesh because they are dirty.

I tried to change that. Everytime she said something racist, I would tell her (very politely) don't be racist. I told her Bangladeshi/Nepalese came to Singapore to earn better wage. They took on a job that otherwise she wouldn't do.

Yesterday, while inside the train I took a picture of Bangladeshi construction worker digging something under the hot sun. I sent it to her with caption 'Working under the hot sun'.

AITA for refusing to compromise my holiday boundaries so my grandparents can see my mom for Christmas?,"My grandparents are both divorced and remarried and i rotate who i spend holidays with (while spending every other one with my in laws) A few years ago I had a big blow out fight with my mom about her never buying my wife a present. She would get me extremely lavish gifts and get her nothing. 

When I confronted her she seemed genuinely dumbfounded about why would she expected to buy present for an in law. She insisted we were being weird and entitled and pointed out that she never bought anything for either of her stepparents. It really bothered my wife and made her feel excluded, so I told my mom she had to buy for either both of us or neither.

She chose to buy for neither and stop attending celebrations. It really soured my relationship with her. My mom got remarried around this time and became even more steadfast in us being insane and she would never expect his family to buy her anything. She claims I'm not even my own person anymore and has done a lot to distance herself. It hurts but I have to support my wife. We just had our first child, so I feel it is even more important to not let anyone mistreat her in front of our daughter.

Both of my grandparents have been complaining that she won't attend Christmas anymore and they miss her. I've been sympathetic, but recently they asked me to compromise on my boundary in hopes my mom would agree to resume family holidays. They even offered to communicate it with her for me, but I said absolutely not. Now there are a lot of hurt feelings on both sides",Everyone Sucks
AITA for asking my ex to pay tuition?,"This will likely get removed, but I’m genuinely conflicted so I’ll give it a shot! My ex-husband (43m) & I (46f) share 2 kids (18m) & (17m) & separated back when they were 3 & 2. We have a child support order in place, but I never held him to as much as the state recommended because I honestly just wanted to be done, & instead signed an agreement for about half of what the calculation was. He only started regularly paying in these last 5yrs through bi-weekly direct deposit (not a formal garnishment just a payroll disbursement), & even made an adjustment because the accountant at his job pointed out 2 extra pay periods a year. Regardless of how much he owed, I’ve always kept my mouth shut because it was just “easier” to accept whatever he was willing to pay. 
Obviously, my 2 boys are hitting major milestones with cars, braces, college, etc., & I’ve tried to bring this up only to be promised support that hasn’t come. All the while he has reaped child tax credit benefits (for 1) & no expense when it comes to any visitation since he moved out of state. He sees them, but I still pay half or more of the expense. 
My oldest is wrapping up his 1st semester of college & I’ve paid the entirety. I’m now paying deposits for the next semester & looking towards fees for the other. Same son also recently had to replace his car due to extensive parking lot damage, which I paid for in full. I’ve let my ex know of all of these expenses & have asked for support but he goes silent or makes jokes (?) about how much anything that comes up must “suck”. 
I can’t cover everything on my own anymore. My oldest’s tuition for Spring is coming up & I’ll soon have 2 kids as the other is graduating in a few months. I’m all but broke. I bring it up & he laughs everything off as a joke because I “make more” than him - even laughed when I said my mom was going to pay for oldest’s dental. I ask for help & am reminded this (his support $) is what I agreed to. 
I finally put my foot down & said if he’s not going to put these boys over his BS with us, then I will argue the agreement that I’ve admittedly not held him responsible to.  He obviously thinks I’m an AH for this. I honestly don’t care what he thinks, but really, AITA for asking & expecting him to finally help??",Everyone Sucks
AITA for giving my friend significantly less money from a YT channel,"Almost 2 years ago I was looking for some deleted videos and found them after months of searching and just uploaded them in case other people wanted to see them and they got a lot of views and the channel had about 700 subs by October 2022. I didn't care too much but my friend kept asking me if I was going to do something with it. I eventually agreed we'd make some actual videos on the channel and **verbally\*** agreed that we can split money 50/50. Recently we haven't uploaded anything related to the content we agreed on making and it's obvious to see. The old videos that I found myself got 80k views in the last month and the more recent other content got 72, \~0.08%. I proposed that I get the percent of money from things that I did myself and he can just take the rest which is barely anything. I was trying to explain and bargain with him, and he was threatening to tell people ""leverage"" that he has against me which some of it would affect me greatly. I could remove him from the channel as he's not an ""owner"" just an ""editor"" in YT terms but he won't sign anything and the arguments are getting annoying. It's still my channel.

Extra info: He also bought something for $260, worked 3.5 months, for 1k sub special and also said half of it was for a late birthday gift for me and is getting upset that he's probably not going to get back what he put in although it was his idea and knew that this type of content doesn't get nearly as many views.

AITA for defending my mom and saying maybe if my wife apologized she would give her free treatments like the rest of the family?,"My mom and my wife don't have the best relationship. My wife previously said my mother should lose her medical license and have to work at Starbucks, because she coerced her now husband into letting her give him Botox and then pretended she fucked it up. He is extremely vain and honestly I probably suck but I found it funny and certainly not our business.

My mom was obviously mad about that, and my wife refused to apologize and said she is stupid and doesn't deserve her license. That was years ago and I think my wife forgot about it. She recently approached my mom and asked if she could help her as she has been feeling so bad about herself lately, and we don't have much disposable income, but she knows my mom does a lot of free stuff for the family.

My mom smiled at her and said sorry but since she doesn't think she should have a medical license, it is probably for the best. my wife said that was years ago and she was being unfair. She got emotional and told her how bad she feels and begged her to do something, but then fucked it up by saying my mom is good at her job and her abusing her husband doesn't negate that. Well my mom got pissed over the word abuse and refused to do anything.

My wife came home and cried her eyes out. I tried to be sympathetic, but when she asked what I thought I was honest. she should not have insulted my mom. I feel she overreacted and then doubled down and made it worse, and maybe if she really sincerely apologizes and grovels a bit, my mom will do it. My wife became furious and accused me of wanting her to humiliate herself, and said she shouldn't have to apologize for speaking up as she didn't want out son (2 at the time) to think that abusive behavior was ok. She currently thinks i'm an asshole and is being distant",Everyone Sucks
AITA BC I don't want to take in his mother and kids,"Recently, my fiance and I just had a baby after struggling with IVF for years. He has three previous children from two separate relationships and a mom who lives with her questionable boyfriend not too far away. I am buying a home, I am putting the money down myself and I am furnishing this home and paying the mortgage without his help. But he wants to move his kids in and he wants to move his mother in and he keeps saying that I should be okay with that as we are a family. I'm not. I've waited a long time to start my own family, and I really don't want to take in his kids be the financial breadwinner for four new people and be a stranger in my own house. I made it clear to him that if he's going to move in he has to help with the bills and it is our home with our new child. I feel like his exes are so excited to lob off their kids on me and his mother is just looking to leave her bad relationship and come live for free in my house. I feel used by all of this and I feel like he's not considering how I feel at all. I'm a new mother I want my new home with my new family on my terms. Am I the a******?",Everyone Sucks
AITA for lying to my gf's friend that my gf is dead?,"I (23f) have been with my girlfriend (22f) for about 2 years. My gf has an ex girlfriend (let's call her Ashley). They are best friends now, after splitting up like 3 years ago. It just didn't work out. 

Now, I never liked Ashley. I guess it's understandable. I'm a jealous person. I never made a big deal out of it tho, until 2 months ago. My gf spent A LOT of her free time with Ashley. I was even about to bring it up to her somehow, in a polite way obviously. Well, my gf suggested a threesome while we were talking about our sexualities etc. Not only I'm not really sexually open when it comes to involving other people, but she wanted our partner to be Ashley. THAT was when I made a HUGE deal out of it. My gf is all about communicating things and said she just wanted to be clear about her desires. After seeing my reaction and hearing about my feelings, we talked it through and she said she would cut contact with Ashley. I know I may sound a little overdramatic, but I was only comfortable this way. 

After two weeks or so, I had to check my gf's phone. Ashley texted her a couple times, wanted to hang out etc but she pretty much ignored her. I was happy until I went through some older messages. They apparently hooked up once, at the beginning of our relationship. I didn't handle it well, so I decided to block Ashley everywhere from my gf's account. After failing to contact my gf herself, Ashley texted me asking about her. For me, she seemed obsessed. So, after a little bit of thinking, I decided to tell her my gf was dead. That's embarrassing and I trust my gf but I definitely don't trust Ashley after finding out how obsessive she is.

I told Ashley my gf got into an accident and died. She seemed upset but that's it. She didn't really ask many questions. But it was a relief. It crossed my mind that maybe it wasn't the brightest idea but I was not thinking clear tbh. I also told her that my gf's accounts were deactivated and that me and her family want some privacy now. It worked. 

Some old friend contacted my gf and sent her screenshots of Ashley's facebook posts. She apparently has been posting 24/7 about my girl and her death. Not only that, but she called her ""my love"", ""my wife"" etc multiple times. She basically acted like they were still together for all these years. Even posted about their upcoming ""anniversary"" with an old picture of them kissing. Really creepy. 

My gf got angry when I told her the truth. She says it's all my fault that it's happening and that I should be the one to fix it. I don't feel guilty when it comes to Ashley's reaction considering she never asked about the funeral or anything, just went straight to facebook. Seems like she just wanted some attention. My gf said she doesn't know if she's able to ever forgive me. I forgave her for cheating and I feel like it's not fair. Am I the asshole?",Everyone Sucks
AITA for saying rude things to my friend?,"MODS: This post mentions relationship problems, but that’s not the main point of the post. Please don’t remove it, or at least read the whole thing if you do.

A few weeks ago, a girl who I’ll call Nicole and I decided that we were going to date. To keep it lowkey since it was both of our first relationships, we only told close friends. But at an event a week or so later, a different girl, who I’ll call Sharon, made a bunch of comments about me and another girl, and after a few drinks I admitted I was dating Nicole. But Sharon SUCKS at keeping secrets, so Nicole and I were both wary. Next day, we were at a different party, and I was hanging out with five of my closest friends, and Sharon. We were all having a good time, but one of them blurted out that I was dating Nicole in front of Nicole’s ex boyfriend. I say one of them because I don’t remember, as I’d had a lot to drink and didn’t seem like a big deal at the time, as I’m on good terms with him, and he just walked away. But, two days later, a get a text from Nicole saying he told a bunch of people she didn’t want knowing, and she was mad at me. I got mad at the group I’d been hanging with, and sent a text to all of them asking who’d told. One by one, they all denied it, except for Sharon, and in blind anger I texted out “It must’ve been Sharon, no surprise there”. Instantly I felt bad because Sharon  lies things waay out of proportion. She replied and said she hated me and tokd me to fuck off. I tried to apologize, but me just texting her caused her to block me. I got mad, and had another friend text her with screenshots of em saying that she was being selfish and rude and trying to start a fight by blocking me before I could apologize, and told her I didn’t care to hang out with someone like that. She told me she didn’t want to be my friend anymore. The worst part is, almost all the friends agreed with her.

So now I have an angry girlfriend, someone who hates me, a bunch of angry friends, and just one friend who isn’t furious at me. Am I the asshole for these comments, and by extension WIBTA if I held my ground. Feedback is greatly appreciated.

Edit: Yes, I did tell Sharon not to tell anyone Nicole and I were dating. I am also not trying to say it was her who told. The point is that I think her response to my admittedly dumb comment was unnecessary. She and I have had brief arguments before, but always resolved, and nothing like this.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for calling someone a bitch?,"I (20M) am a college student. Recently, we had a group presentation to do, which our group has a whole really fucked up. One of our team members is this girl with whom I don’t really get along. We often get into disagreements and don’t quite enjoy each other’s presence.

She chose to personally attack and blame me specifically for our poor performance as a group. She went on saying “it’s all your fault that the presentation sucked, I am gonna email and tell them that you’re not a part of our group…” etc. I argued back and brought up my own argument in regard to how this was a fuck up from all of our side and what she did (literally stole an entire presentation from the internet for our pitch).

This was when she was clearly fuming, and retaliates with “is this how your dad yells at your mom?” out of the blue. Keep in mind that there’s no context to this at all, but I do know that her dad took off and left her family when she was a child. Neither did I yell at her, I merely just raised my voice to some extent. She randomly brought up my family into a personal argument, and I lost it at this point. I replied “Oh, so you’re gonna bring in my family into this argument? Go fuck yourself, you fucking bitch”

Now she’s going around trash talking me and telling people that I called her a bitch (I don’t really care) but I would love to hear your thoughts on this. Am I the asshole for calling her a bitch?",Everyone Sucks
AITA for yelling at my mom because she didn’t take me to a music convention?,"I(16m) have found a love for music and want to spend the rest of my life playing music. I am an extremely dedicated musician and spend hours and hours every day practicing and making music. I have a group of friends who live in the city and who also love music and we have become pretty close. They told me about a very big music convention that took place all of this week. I told my mom about this as soon as I heard it from my friends as I thought this would be a great opportunity to meet and introduce myself to a lot of the most successful and famous musicians of my instrument. She says she will do her best as she know it means a lot to me.

Fast forward a few months and it’s now a few weeks from the event. I again talk to her about it and she says that she will do her best to get me there. I am extremely excited at this point because my love for music has grown even more and the thought of meeting some of my musical heroes is amazing. I’ve made plans with my friends and scheduled a time that I would meet them there.

Throughout this whole time period my mom is extremely busy working. However the funny thing is that her would is literally completely voluntary. Yet she spends all her waking hours running around stressed, starting arguments and yelling at every person she sees. I don’t really care about this and it’s not really the main point as I don’t really spend much time with her anyways because she is a horrible person to be around.

So now 3 days ago and I ask her again and she says she doesn’t know how I’ll get there. Keep in mind, I’ve talked to her numerous times about how I wanted to be there and about how I should get there and she’s shrugged it off. So now I have no way of getting there and decide that I’ll just take the train. I take the train to the city multiple times a week and it has never raised any problems with my parents. So I tell her and she says she doesn’t want me taking public transport. This confused me as literally I take it 4 TIMES A WEEK. She again tells me that she’ll do her best to drive me or something because she knows how much it means to me.

At this point I’m extremely frustrated because I know she doesn’t actually care. This isn’t a one time thing to. She does this with everything, says she cares and proceeds to give evidence proving the exact opposite. So yeah, as you can tell by the title she doesn’t take me because she’s working.

There is no apology, not even an aknowledgment. It’s like it wasn’t even a thing. Long story short I yelled at her. I know this is a bad thing to do, she has raised me and given me the opportunity to do music. But I was just so mad at her.

This is really just one example of the same thing. Only this really did suck because it actually meant a lot to me.",Everyone Sucks
"AITA for ""outing"" my roommate?","First off I (22m) am gay and he (22m) is not.

We were having a party at our apartment and the two of us were talking to an acquaintance of mine from class. I'm not particularly close with her but I was just making small talk with her and I complemented her on her outfit (we were having a themed costume party). Evidently Trent, mr oommmate, was  unhappy with me for not ""wingmaning"". So when I was talking to someone else  he told her ""why are you talking to him? you know he's gay right?"". This isn't super ideal for me because I'm not out to the general public just to a handful of friends including the roommates I live with but also I didn't care too much. 

I didn't overhear the exchange but one of our other roommates Evan did. The girl who heard it asked Evan is this true and said it was kinda problematic if Trent's just outing me etc. Evan being drunk/high decided to downplay it by saying he thinks Trent's just into me and being territorial. 

Other people overheard and thought it was kinda funny and the situation was a little uncomfortable for me so when people asked me if its true I said we are waiting for marriage because of our religion.

Somehow Trent's girlfriend got word of this rumor and she confronted me. I'm not particularly close to her so I was sort of offended she was pressing me for details. She asked if I had hooked up with him and I said no but I acted intentionally suspicious like I had been caught in some lie and even though I told her no (which is the truth) she became convinced that we had hooked up. She pretty quickly broke up with him because even though they are/were open (at least to some degree) him messing around with guys is a dealbreaker (LOL).

Now it's been a few days and Trent is super mad at me, blames me for ruining his relationship and one of our mutual friends is taking his side. I'm starting to feel bad but also there's nothing I can do because I have zero credibility with his now ex gf.

AITA for not splitting a repair bill with husband,"My husband, 34, and I, 28, bought a house together with a septic tank. We have a joint account for bills and separate accounts with our own spending money. We have a septic tank, and we use wipes to clean ourselves after the bathroom. I have instructed my husband to put wipes on the trash can because even wipes that say they are safe to flush cause damage. He said it was disgusting to throw poop in the trash can. Well, earlier this week, the toilet won't flush and overflowed. We call a plumbing specialist to take a look at it, and he ends up pulling a clog of wipes out of the tank. My husband said it must have been some uninformed house guest, but the plumbing specialist said it had to be years of regular flushing of them. I know I had not been flushing them, so it had to be my husband. I confronted him and accused him, and he confessed to flushing wipes. He wanted us to contribute equally to the bill, and I said he created this problem, and I refused to contribute to this disaster.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for telling my mom she sucks at parenting because she is in denial of my phobias?,"      A little Backstory: I may have phobia called Haphephobia (self diagnosed from research) where I hate the idea of people touching me, but I never was sexually harassed and I hate showing affecting. Which included, saying or texting I love you,. I also have a mild case of Agroaphobia where I hate going outside during the day, it makes me very anxious to go outside, sometimes I think the brink of a panic attack.  

      Some issues I have had: These have been accusing ever since my fear of being touched started to rise around 10 or 11. At first, I have confused why it repulsed to be hugged by my family. I began asking them to please not touch me or hug me because it makes me feel trapped and scared. They always ignored me and continued to forcefully hug me saying, “It’s just a hug we are your family.” over the years have gained a very deep hatred for them with the lack of them even trying to understand. There have been many screaming matches and me running away for a couple of hours to calm myself down. My mom (39F) always tells me I’m overreacting and I should open up more because the fear of being touched isn’t supposed to hold up for family, even though I have expressed it does.. 

   A cut down version of the situation: 

 On Christmas, they wanted to take a picture and told us to stand next to each other. I didn’t want to put an arm around my brother or sister (19F). They began telling me to just do it because it was just a picture and my began trying to force his hand around my shoulder. I flinched back scared and my mom rolled her eyes annoyed and told me never mind. I was pushed and said to just accept I hate being touch. She quickly snapped back it was not normal, and I yelled at her what’s not normal is that none of you are accepting I hate it and keep trying to force it and somehow turning it back into me. She said she didn’t want to get into an argument over something so stupid. I quickly told her she sucks as a good parent and shouldn’t have had kids if you weren’t ready to be an adult about things like this. I sat in my bed crying silently and hyperventilating from my brothers arm reaching for me while they began taking picture of my sister and brother hugging and laughing about now it looks good without the weirdo. Today, they are acting like nothing has happened and are confused about my shut off attitude? 

   So AITA for telling her she sucks at parenting for not being a grown up?

Update: Officially diagnosed with Haphephobia by a professional. Since then, I have now been treated as a “freak”. I am not allowed in family photos because the no touching makes it “not so family like” and I am still forcefully hugged and touched while they laugh at me. I believe they aren’t ever gonna change and I should accept this as my new normal..",Everyone Sucks
AITA for making a money claim against my neighbour for damaging my parcel,"So I had a laptop being delivered to my house, I wasn’t in when it was due to be delivered. I assumed they delivery driver would just leave a card for me to pick up or arrange a redelivery. When I came home I found my item in the alley down the side of my house, it had been thrown over it. I opened up the £2000 laptop to see it was completely smashed and broken. 

So I went to check the cctv in my house to see what had happened. I was shocked it was my neighbour who had chucked the parcel over my fence. I couldn’t understand why they had done this as I could of collected it later on that day. And I’ve taken there parcels before. 

First thing I did was ring the delivery people up and they said they can’t do anything to help as it was delivered in perfect condition. So I went over to my neighbours.

AITA for going over there raising my voice at my neighbours and telling them I will be making a money claim against them for the damages? They did say they have a note on there door not to drop anyone else’s parcels off at their house and they were fed up because it keeps happening with other peoples parcel. They also said there’s no way they could afford a £2000 laptop money claim.

AITA for asking my boyfriend to work at the office 2 days a week?,"My boyfriend (m35) and I (F34) live together with our son (m2). We both work 4 days a week and have 1 day with our son. My boyfriend has lost both his parents a couple of years ago and an unborn child with his previous partner. He’s had a hard time since then. 

Since we’ve moved in together (3 years ago) my boyfriend has had issues with going to the office. We are both people that need space to function, for us that means being alone in the house. I have ADD so I really need my alone time. We agreed we would ‘give’ each other one day a week without the other one home. We also agreed we would be at the office when the other was home with our son. 

My boyfriend always seemed to have a problem that could only be solved by working from home.  He’s had 3 jobs and all 3 jobs have made it ‘impossible’ for him to work at the office. He was reluctant to go because of covid, it was difficult because he had to ask permission to go to the office and now the reason is because he hates his job. 

I’ve also asked him to please leave me alone while working, because I’m easily distracted and need a long time to regain my concentration. He agrees to -and it works for a week- after a week he starts to bother me again. When confronted he always says he is just happy and in the heat of the moment and forgets our agreement. 

Al these years I have tried to ask him to work at the office, I’ve begged, pleaded, tried to talk though his difficulties, but to no avail.

I feel like I have no time alone, because I’m either with the baby or working, and when I’m working from home, he is also home. And he doesn’t leave me alone while I’m working. I’m losing my mind.

I quit my job 1 year ago because I was tired of not sleeping and I wanted to change jobs. Also because we had a lot of fights over the above and I thought that maybe quitting my job and finding some rest at home would help. It was a tough year for me. Also my dad died this summer. My boyfriend did what he could to support me. It included doing 50/50 housework, even though I was home, so I could have done 100%. I’m really grateful for this of course. 

I’ve recently started a new job and I need to study for exams. So I really need my time alone. 

So an hour ago I asked him to please work from the office for two days a week. He agreed and said he would try to work towards it, but that it would take time because it was difficult for him.  I also told me I had to work on trying to learn to concentrate while he is home. He feels as if he is being kicked out of the house. 

I lost it and told him to please start working on his issues because it’s not normal to never go to the office. 

So, aita? I feel like I’m the asshole here because I was home for an entire year and he helped me through it and he is obviously having larger issues here so I should be greatfull for the year he supported me and just suck it up and help him through his issues.

EDIT I’ve been informed I need to add this for clarity: I work from the office 3 days and work 1 day at home, as per our agreement, my bf doesn’t want to do 2 days at work and 2 at home. Also my boyfriend didn’t financially support me during my year off.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for serving my sister's husband dinner using toy utensils?,"

I, m17, moved in with  you sister after my parents kicked me out for coming out (another story) they said I'll be here temporarily til I get back to ""normal"" which I don't think I will, lol. But uh...anyways, so I moved in with my sister and her husband about a month ago. FYI she does everything around the house (I started helping here and there) as well as looking after a 2 year old niece and now she's 6 months pregnant. BIL does nothing because he's the breadwinner as he claims but imo he's taken it a bit too far. e.g he'd tell her to start his laundry once he takes off his clothes, put dinner on the table once he's home, get the shower ready and so on.


They fight a lot cause my sister is exhausted and burnt out, I usually put my headphones on and mind my own business but 2 nights ago there was a lot of commotion once heart home so I went to see what the issue was. Turns BIL was complaining about dinner and my sister was too exhausted to get up. I mean the dinner was already cooked but he wanted her to put it for him on the table. I told my sister I'd do it, but instead of using their kitchen utensils, I used my niece's toy utensils like toy cup, toy plate, toy fork and knife and a tiny napkin. I put the food on the toy plate and the drink in the toy cup while BIL was in the shower. He then came into the kitchen and sat down and stared at the plate for few seconds. He then looked at me and asked what the he'll this was, and whether I was joking. I told him if he wanted to act like a helpless child, then he might as well get treated like one. He began yelling and my sister came inside. He then threw the napkin and stormed off upon saying that I'd disrespected him and that he'll let my parents know about what I did. My sister saw what I'd done and started laughing. I went inside my room but the argument didn't stop, now he's expecting an apology for me for meddling in his marriage and pulling this crappy stunt on him. I could be TA for this but I was just so mad for my sister and also sick and tired of being sick and tired of the nightly fighting over dinner.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for telling my SIL to f off after she called me a horrible parent?,"My (25F) SIL (32F) and my brother (31M) came to visit us for my mom's birthday this weekend. 

Nothing's wrong with that by itself, but my SIL is UNBEARABLE. We disagree on a lot of things when it comes to parenting. She's the type who wants full control over whatever her kids are doing, thinking, watching, basically their entire life.

I'm the type who thinks that their kids should learn to be independent and grow as a person without me breathing down their backs over the smallest details.  SIL has always disliked me for this POV.

Don't get me wrong, I'll discipline my daughter (9F) when she does something bad, but I'm not going to punish her for having interests/being herself.

This all came to a head yesterday when my SIL asked me when I was going to be making dinner (they just got here yesterday). I said that we don't eat dinner together (I know it sounds weird but everyone in my house is on their own schedule and my daughter doesn't like most of the things I do).

I said if she wanted I could order something for her, but she said something like ""how could you just leave your daughter to eat by herself? And you let her watch her tablet while she eats??""

I said yes, I do, and my daughter prefers to eat alone so she doesn't have to turn off her shows. SIL called me a horrible parent, and said that I should be watching what my kid is doing at dinner.

I told her to F off, and that she should let her kids breathe for darn second because she's suffocating them with her controlling behavior. She started crying and hasn't spoken to me since, my brother agrees that she was being rude, but what I said was also out of line. I don't think so, but AITA?",Everyone Sucks
AITA for saying that ultimately I have no power over my wife and would never control her clothing?,"Growing up my mom always taught me body autonomy, and also not to be an asshole to women. As a result I've never been controlling in my marriage and don't think highly of men who try to control their partners.

Now for the issue. My mom and my wife hate each other. They can hardly be in the same room and obviously I chose my wife, but I'm not ready for full no contact with my mom, so we do still see each other on important days such as her wedding.

My wife wasn't excited for my mom's wedding as she thinks my mom ruined our wedding with her complaining, refusing to wear what she was told, refusing to brush her hair, calling us assholes for having a black tie wedding, and basically showing up in a gown, but everything else looked underdone, hair, makeup, etc. She felt she was showing off, and showing how she didn't care.

I was nervous about how she would act at my mom's wedding. She came down in a full on gown, like a wedding dress, and I begged her to change, but she said no, and if i wouldn't drive her she would uber, so I was like fine whatever. I don't think I get to be the ultimate authority on what she wears, and also I doubted my mom would care. I cannot even describe how laid back she is.

I'm not sure if my mom even saw the dress. If she did there was zero reaction. She didn't really talk to us, but her friends were there, and I'm not sure she likes us much these days. My wife was embarrassing me as she was massively overdressed and clearly trying to be the bride.

The issue is my grandmother, my grandfather (divorced) and the groom's mom cussed us out. I was really verbally abused over it, so I snapped at them that maybe their marriages suck, but I have no control over my wife. I even texted my mom after the fact and asked if she was mad.

AITA for blaming my friend for a poor grade?,"Hello, I am a guy from the Balkans who recently got in a heated argument. I am currently a younger teenager (ages not disclosed) and in school. I care a lot about my grades and have been a straight A student always. I have a friend....or I should say, I used to have a friend who I will call Jacob (to not invade his privacy). Basically, this is what happened:



This year I got Chemistry as a new class. I got an A pretty quickly and moved on. About a week ago I had a test in Chemistry. I studied overall about 6 hours for it and was ready. However, a massive problem came: Jacob constantly called me throughout the entire 45 minute class! I could not think straight. Imagine someone calls your name in a very stingy tone in a way that is quiet but you somehow always manage to hear it. My concentration completely flopped.



I was pretty angry with him and called him out on it. I told him multiple times during the test that I will help him, he just needs to wait so I can get my stuff together. He didn't listen once! I did some math. He called my name about 7 times every minute. That is 315 times someone said my name! My teacher didn't hear a single call, somehow! I was frustrated, I had to basically do my work, do some of his and another friend (however that friend only asked me a few times throughout the entire thing, which is more than acceptable).



Today I found it I got a C, which damages my chances for an A significantly. I instantly bursted crying and was swearing to myself. Jacob looked at me for 5 seconds and walked away. He got a D! Without me he would have gotten an F! He didn't apologize for being an arse, he didn't thank me for helping him, he didn't do anything! 



I just came home extremely exhausted and sick from the whole thing. The fact one appreciates my character and help so poorly that I have to oversee my grades suffer as a result is damning. My dad recommends I cut contact permanently (Jacob has done other stuff before, nothing major but some stupid stuff. This is the worst he has gotten).


I feel as though I may have overreacted though. Have I? Side note: I didn't say a single swear word to him, so he didn't get to hear any of that stuff. I swore to my two pals (basically dumb stuff like ""he can suck my dick"" and whatnot). I later learned that he lied about me, saying that he only asked my when I finished my test, which is complete BS.

AITA For being overly sensitive to negative feedback?,"I was really excited for the holidays today but when I invited my brother over, things got downhill fast. For context: 

\-my brother and my dad don't have the best relationship, so whenever my brother comes over to visit, my dad has to leave so my brother immediately doesn't drive away.

\-My mother forces me to go to church. I've told her politely several times that I'm not christian, and that the weekly church visits make me more irrational and stressed out. 

I was showing brother a movie I loved and was really passionate about. I told him several times before he saw the film that I absolutely adored it. However when he started watching the movie I could tell he wasn't really into it. I understand how my taste in media won't appeal to everybody, so I offered to him multiple times that he could stop watching the movie if he wanted to. He basically ignored me, and about half way through the movie, I asked him what he thought of it since he stopped paying attention. He then went on to say how the movie sucked, how it made no sense, etc. I know this may seem a bit silly to get worked up over, but showing somebody a piece of media I really enjoy, just to hear them insult it is one of my nightmare scenarios, and I felt espeicially hurt since he knew I enjoyed the movie. He then went on the lay on the couch and declined to partake in any other activities (playing cards, board games, etc.) we offered him. A few seconds later he complained that he was bored and that there was nothing to do.

At this point, I was irritated with him since he is a full grown man, and I felt incredibly upset I had to entertain him when I was 4 years younger than him (I'm a teenager). I was also sad that I had to deal with somebody (I thought) was incredibly inconsiderate about my feelings, when I could be spending time with my dad, whom I rarley get to spend quality time with due to a variety of factors.

I eventually  discreetly walked upstairs him and my mom watched another movie. My mom must have noticed that I had been crying , and after the movie was finished and my brother had left, she went into my room to talk to me. I told her I didn't want to discuss what happened since I had just cheered up a little thanks to my friends. She then went on to pressure me until I snapped and got into a crying/screaming match telling her why I was so upset. She then went on to tell me I was being overly sensitive. She told me that I cracked under pressure too easily, and that I needed to change my behavior. She use the fact that I got annoyed with a child who screams nearly every time I go to church as a example of how overly sensitive I was.

"AITA for yelling at my wife after she put our children in danger, but not yelling at my family?","My  mom is married to ""Rick"" not even going to call him my stepdad. He does  not like me, does not speak to me, and I recently learned doesn't  actually know which of my kids is which. That being said we can hang out  and be civil. He just will not talk to me.

Recently  we went to a beach with Rick, my mom, and my aunt and uncle. The set up  kind of sucked because the sand area was very narrow, so we had to walk  pretty far to get a spot. Since we have kids we had a lot of stuff, and  had to go back to the car. I told my wife to stay with the kids and I'd  get it even if I had to make two trips.

At  this point I don't know where my aunt was. My mom took her dog for a  little walk, and my uncle was also making a trip back to get some stuff  for my one year old cousin. So Rick was the only person sitting. My wife  asked Rick if he would keep an eye on the kids while she went to the  car. He said no. She told him he was being childish and it would only be  a minute.

I did see her in the  parking lot, but she told me Rick was watching the kids. When we  returned my aunt yelled at me that we are irresponsible and stupid, and  that she had to go in the water and get my kids. My wife asked Rick what  was going on and he said he told her no, and called us both fucking  idiots. He said the kids were fine and he wouldn't have let them drown  (I agree with my aunt that they shouldn't have been out there)

My  wife yelled at Rick, and my aunt began to berate us (she was mad  because she didn't have a good spot to put her baby) At this point my  mom came down and asked what was going on. My wife began to yell at my  mom that she never should have married Rick, and this is her fault for  bringing him into the family.

I  snapped at my wife and told her she always treats my mom like shit for  the most minor things, but she was irresponsible and owes our kids,  Rick, and my aunt an apology. I said she put out kids in danger, so how  am i supposed to trust her again, and said she needed to use her head.

She  began to cry and said I was being mean. She asked if I was going to  yell at my aunt for being a bitch, or yell at my mom for marrying Rick  and I said no. Now she is angry with me, and saying she doesn't want to  be around my mom anymore for marrying Rick. For reference our kids are  all under 5 and two can't swim.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for taking a nap after work?," I (26f) am mildly autistic and get really tired after a full day of work. Today I was getting sleepy and told my bf I would like to take a nap.
He got on the couch with me and we cuddled, after which went to sleep, with him laying next to me. Next thing I know I am waking up by the sound of the vacuum (mind you, I am autistic and this is one of the worst sounds for me). This all because my bf decided he needed to do things. I got angry at him because he could have just woken me up first, tell me he still needed to do some stuff and THEN start vacuuming. I would have understood, honestly. Bf says if I already slept 50mins he should be free to do whatever and was already doubting for 15mins if he should start doing things or not. Says I ALWAYS need to set on alarm AND tell him for how long I will be sleeping. I just want to be woken up by him, rather then the horrid sound of the vacuum.

He asked his brother and  sister-in-law if they could help (who live half hour from the hair salon), which thankfully they can, however,  this is going to add half hour to my drive each way because they live in  the boondocks.

AITA I found out I have a long lost cousin before Thanksgiving,"I did not know this Thanksgiving drama thing was an actual phenomena that people experienced, but I just found out that my aunt had another daughter before the 5 she had with my Uncle and I am shook. I have a whole ass cousin that literally no one told me about for 25 years until me and my Uncle are having a few beers and he says that it's her birthday today. 

 I asked why they never told us about her and he said I was  because he demanded my aunt had to leave her with her father when they got together. I told my brother and we reached out over facebook and invited her to my parents house for thanksgiving dinner. 

I guess she told my aunt that she was going to come over because my aunt calls and explodes on us about being disrespectful and invading her privacy.  I asked her why she cared if her daughter came to Thanksgiving at our house. Also, her daughter is 27 so she could make her own decisions. 

My uncle called me a dick for bring it up and told him if he hadn't gave my aunt that ultimatum,  we would have had time to get to know her organically. He just backed his wife and said that that's their life. My aunt wants me to uninvite my cousin but I told her no so she stormed off into the guest bedroom and hasn't come out for a while. 

My parents are staying neutral in this and say that if she shows up, she is welcome to eat with us and my brothers are on the same page as me. My cousins are all teens and they knew about her but never talk about her. 

 I know people are entitled to private matters in life, I just think that they should have told me if we had family that we didn't know about and that if I find out that someone is related to me, I have the right to get to know them despite the relationship they have with their parents.

WIBTA: if I told my roommate I don’t care that she’s uncomfortable with my guests?,"Tomorrow, we have to do a roommate agreement for our shared dorm at uni.  I (f21) and my roommate, ‘Sola’ (f21) have been friends for 4 years but recently had a falling out.  I did everything I could to reconcile, and really everything because I wanted to make sure if we still weren’t friends by the end I could remember that I did my best, but we wound up at an impasse when I asked her to be considerate of my feelings if she expected me to be considerate of her feelings, and she said that was unfair (she had sent an inconsiderate text and I had sent a rude text in response, which wasn’t meant to be rude at the time but later I recognized that it could’ve been softer.  But my request that she try and see my side of things was deemed ‘unfair’ and ‘unsympathetic’).  

We have to settle how we plan to go forward as roommates, and one of the questions on the roommate agreement is about guest policy.  We had a lot of mutual friends, but she pushed each one away.  She had even written off two of our friends before talking with them because they were roommates with someone she newly-hated (Felice, 21f).  While she has pushed away all her friends and is now basically all alone with bridges burnt, I’m not.  I’m still friends with her newly sworn enemy Felice and those two she wrote off and everyone else.  I’d like to have them over as guests again.  I’m totally open to warning her ahead of time that I’m inviting guests so she won’t be unprepared.

However, I anticipate resistance.  She really hates Felice over a rude text Felice had sent.  Felice doesn’t have great social skills and she called her text ‘tactful’, she really had no idea she had hurt Sola that much, and wanted to talk to Sola about it, but Sola won’t give her a chance to explain herself, and she told our group of friends that we have to pick between the two of them, and we told her we weren’t doing that; we’re not kicking Felice out.  So she felt we had all turned against her and decided to not talk to us anymore.  She already told her bf (19m) that he can’t go to our group meetups because Felice will be there and if he goes it would cause tension for them.  We offered her a 50/50 split where sometimes Felice will come to group things and sometimes she won’t so that Sola can come, but that was rejected.  Sola wanted it to be all or nothing.  So, based on that and how she wrote off all of Felice’s roommates purely on the fact that they’re her roommates, I see her having a problem with my guests, even if I offer a warning.  I think she’s still going to feel ‘all or nothing’ about it.  

So, reddit, would I be the asshole if I told my roommate to suck it up and deal with the consequences of her actions and that I don’t care that she’s uncomfortable with my guests I’m still having them over?
Edit: we each have our own bedrooms with our own bathrooms, she does not ever have to see my friends when they come over, and it would be infrequent gatherings (once or twice a week, tops)


UPDATE: we did the roommate agreement, and I was spot on about the resistance.  Sola said several times she was extremely uncomfortable with me having guests, even if I gave her a heads up and only had them when she wasn’t there.  In the end, the RA told her it wasn’t fair to me to say I can’t have any guests at all ever because I live here too and I should be allowed to have friends over (provided they’re respectful, of course).  It doesn’t matter that we can hang out elsewhere, I live here and am allowed to have my friends over occasionally, especially since it’s only once a week (many of you suggested we hang out else where, which Sola also said, but the RA shut that down).  She eventually relented provided I promised Felice would not come, to which I agreed.  We picked a time when she will never be around and has never been around all semester so no one is going out of their way to accommodate.  

Additionally, some people are under the impression all of this was over purely text, it was not.  It’s an extremely long story, but even the texts were all talked about.  As I said in my story, I was willing to acknowledge wrongdoing and apologize but she wasn’t so we came to an impasse in person, but she has had in-person convos with most people.  She is still not willing to talk to Felice about the text, and is throwing away most of her friends over this text and some other things that have built up over time.  I am not throwing away any of my friends and am striving for cordiality with Sola, and we’ve both agreed to try and work together and rebuild some trust.

AITA for wearing a dress that my cousin wanted to wear,"my aunt had a beautiful gown type dress gifted to her by a friend who was a fashion designer. it was supposed to be handed down to her daughter once she turned 18 

i grew up as a fat kid, and my cousin was always skinny. she used to bully me about my weight to the point where i was deeply insecure about my body. i lost around 40 pounds when i was 16, around the time she was diagnosed with pcos. she gained around 100 pounds in a year and was constantly bitter about it

i know what it’s like to be insecure about your body so i never bought up the weight gain, but the same can’t be said for my family. they teased her the way she had once teased me, except she was much bigger than i’d ever been

on her 18th birthday her mother didn’t give her the dress like everyone thought she would. she threw a tantrum when her mother told her that she was too big to ever fit into it and gave it to me instead

she shouldn’t have shamed her like that in front of everyone but by that point she must’ve been around 400 lbs and the dress was made to fit my 100 lb slender aunt. she refuses to lose weight too so the dress would’ve been wasted on her

my cousin stopped talking to me after that which i was grateful for but we eventually crossed paths at our younger aunts wedding. id chosen to wear my other aunt’s dress because it’s stunning and fit with the theme perfectly. my cousin saw me and started screaming that i was rubbing it in her face that i’d gotten the dress and that i was a toxic bitch and she hated me. that hurt, but i couldn’t help but feel a little bit of triumph because of how she abused me for my weight when we were younger. i didn’t respond and i walked away because i didn’t want to ruin my aunts special day and she was hushed by her mother. so, AITA?

edit: i did offer to let her keep the dress but she refused. in her words she said ‘i don’t want it but you can’t have it either you don’t deserve it!’ i decided i was done with her petty bullshit and kept it for myself. she’s a small scale body positive influencer and believes losing weight will give her followers the wrong impression so she said herself she’ll never be able to wear it",Everyone Sucks
"AITA for turning my wife's workout room into an office despite getting a ""No"" from her?","
Throwaway and all that...

I genuinely don't know if I fucked up or not so we'll see.


So I  M/32 struggled with lack of employment for several months, I finally got a job opportunity that requires me to work from hom and for that I needed a quiet space which is hard to find in a 3 room apartment with 2 kids.

My wife has a ""workout"" room with all of her ..working equipment!. I asked if she'd let me have it so I could turn it into an office for my work and she said ""no"" no discussions no compromises just ""No"" man.

I tried to reason with her and explained to her why an office is more needed than an exercise room but to no avail, no is still no.

I thought that she was being unsupportive and unappreciative of the fact that I'm trying to make us money to provide for the family. I waited for her to leave the apartment then had all her workout stuff out and turned the room into an office away from the noise and distraction. She came home and lost her shit on me for doing this and yelled that I was being inconsiderate of her struggles with keeping fit and healthy since she has a number of disorders that she only manages via working out but I took that away from her, I explained to her that I have a stronger cause because I need the room so I can work and again earn us money to keep a roof over our heads yet, she called me a manipulative, and abusive sob for going behind her back and kicking her out the room like this. She demanded I put everything back but I said no and even told her she was being a child throwing a temper tantrum over silly shit and not giving a shit about my work conditions when she should be accommodating me. She told me to fuck off since this is her apartment too and I had no right to steal her room.

She's sulking to the fullest degree now and is trying to get me to put everything back, AITA?",Everyone Sucks
"AITA for refusing to wear ""protection"" at a family get together?","SEE UPDATE ON MY PROFILE 

For context: 

My (18F) family gets together every summer in my grandparents' cottage, its really big house and can accommodate all/most of the family.

This summer has been the first time doing the get together since Covid and everyone has made a huge effort to come as it's a very important tradition.

It's my parents generation, with some as young as their early 30s, and then their kids (1-8) and finally, me and my younger cousin (15F) in the middle, who I don't get along with as she's a bit of a brat/mean towards me.

I usually don't mind playing babysitter, but this time I was asked to too much and I'm afraid refusing it might create permanent damage to my relationship with my family.

Most of children are at that age where they are potty training or still wetting the bed (this runs in my family quite a lot), and some of the older kids were refusing to put on their nighttime underwear because they were embarrassed to do it with their cousins there (not all of them wet the bed) so my grandmother decided that to avoid any embarrassment for the children they would all wear ""protection"" for a few days and then would be able to stop wearing it if they did not wet the bed.

This was all well until my cousin, 15, who sleeps with the kids (she's still considered one) was asked to wear the ""protection"" too to set a good example for the children.

I did not see anything especially wrong with this, my family has a VERY strong division between adults and children, and being 18yrs old I was excited to be a part of the ""adults"" club, and thought that obviously any rules applied to all the children would apply to my cousin.

She however did not like having to wear protection for bedwetting and thought she was too old for that. My grandmother reminded her that I had wet my bed until I was 16 so she was not too old.

She argued that if she, who had not wet the bed in over 10yrs, had to wear the protective underwear, then so should I because I only stopped bedwetting a couple of years ago (last time I was there) and it would ""make her feel better"".

So now my grandmother is insisting I wear the pull-ups for a few days with the children, but I refused because I think it's going to crush my chances at having an ""adult"" summer free of all the children's rules and having been a bedwetter it's really humiliating to ""go back"" to pull-ups

She said that a ""mature adult"" would do the right thing and wear them, and that I ""might need them anyway"". She at least kept this between me and my cousin for the moment.

After a long she said that I either followed the rules to her house or left, and that she would be letting everyone know why I had left too.

 I feel like letting win will only encourage my cousin's behaviour and tell my grandmother I am still a child, but if I leave this important event I might create a strain with my family.

So.... AITA for refusing and making things difficult for everyone?

Edit: comments have made me see it's VERY wrong to do it to my cousin too + I should side with her united",Everyone Sucks
AITA for not letting my grandma stay at my house until she has power?,"My grandma (79F) has dementia, though my mom (50F) doesn’t want to believe it. Mom moved her to FL from MD to “get away from the ghosts.” Obviously that didn’t work. The plan is for my parents to move also but my dad’s (52M) still waiting on his work transfer.

There’s an in-law suite which my sister (18F now 19) moved into. Sister had no driver’s license. I knew she couldn't care for grandma alone so I sold my condo and moved in. For \~1 year I took her to the doctor, cooked, cleaned, etc. I had my own space. The shared kitchen was an issue because she constantly moved my things and they’d be lost with no memory of where she put them. She refuses to shower some days. She uses utensils for food then puts them on a tablecloth, leaving food residue everywhere. At one of her doctor’s appointments she peed on herself in the bathroom and walked out to the lobby carrying her pants and saying a ghost peed on her. She was trying to yell at a lady that worked there by the time I saw her.

2 months ago I bought a house with my boyfriend. Our friend (27M) rents and lives with us. Sis took over with caring for grandma. Currently, because of the hurricane they're without power with no ETA. Mom texted me today to say something needs to be done.

We could put her in a hotel. Grandma has $30k in savings so money isn't an issue, but if she walks out she might get lost there. I don’t think she’d leave the room, but if she does, the staff can direct her back to her room. I’d drop in when I’m not working to bring her food.

Mom wants grandma stay with me since I have a spare room. Here’s where I might be TA. I don’t want her staying with me and neither does my BF. I don’t want her messing with/breaking my things, leaving messes/unsanitary conditions, etc. She doesn’t know how to be quiet and she’s up at random hours during the day/night. I don’t want her to wake the people in my household. Sometimes she walks around without pants and I don’t want my BF to have to see that, let alone my roommate. I don’t want her to be rude to them.

My dad normally agrees with me on matters regarding grandma. So I was surprised that he said it's shitty of me to not let grandma stay with me after I was able to live with her for free, and that even though it sucks, BF and I should deal with it.

I love my grandma and I know her problems aren’t things she can control. I feel resentful of mom for moving her here basically alone. I did live there for free, but she never cared about receiving rent, and I put in a lot of work to take care of her while I lived there. I’m very grateful to her. I feel guilty that I’m refusing for her to stay here, but there’s other solutions. Mom hasn’t called yet but I'm expecting her to go off on me.

WIBTA if I told my grandma that she is fat phobic and her being concerned about my weight is simply her insecurities about her own body.,"Tldr; grandma fat shamed my brother and I and I want to tell her but I'm worried about how she'll take it.

My grandma (87f) has always been obsessed with the weight of her family. When my brother (33m) gained a bunch of weight, she would harp on him and he didn't like it so he set boundaries. She would say he's yelling at her or scaring her so we always assumed he was in the wrong. I (25f) gained 65 lbs and my grandma started on me though not a lot. Mostly it was taking the bread away from me after I've had a slice in restaurants or asking everyone else if they wanted a slice of cake except me. 

When my brother died, all her attentions focused on me. I understood why he was adamant about setting the boundaries. When I visited her, she would say she's worried about my weight because she has diabetes and doesn't want me to get it. I said it's my body and if it happens then it's on me. She would cry while saying this and I would always feel guilty and hug her and tell her I understand. 

Then she started saying if I didn't loose weight and dress better then I would never find a rich, successful, and handsome husband. I told her that that's not what I want. I want a comfortable and simple lifestyle. It doesn't matter if he's a garbage truck driver or a farmer, if he has honest work then that's good enough for me. I've told her so many times I've lost count.

Whenever I wear clothes that are comfortable for me (not baggy but not form fitting), she says I don't look good in them. She looks at tight clothes and says that's what I should be wearing to find a rich husband even though I tell her I don't feel comfortable wearing clothes like that.
If I get a second helping of food then my mom later tells me that my grandma had been eyeballing my plate and pursing her lips.

I was stressed at my job and wanted to quit to go to school for something else. She offered to foot my bills while I did that on the condition I lost weight. I agreed even though I knew I wouldn't because I was so tired and depressed at my job. I know I'm the AH for agreeing. She obviously said she won't pay for my bills anymore and I said I have zero problem getting a new job. 

When we close out the agreement next month, I want to tell her every hurtful thing she's said to me and everytime I cried about it. That she is fat phobic and because she got diabetes from being overweight doesn't mean she has the right to try to control what I eat. I hate the way I look. I hate my stretch marks. Sometimes I think I hate her but that's the emotions getting the best of me. 

Wibta if I tell her all this knowing she's 87 and is very unlikely to change. Will it just hurt her but i should just suck it up because I have so little time left with her? She'll definitely start crying and say all she has ever done was for me and she just wants me to be healthy.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for not inviting my friend to come in?,"3 months ago on my bday, my friend came to my city to celebrate my bday with me. He wanted to make me feel good. It was a really nice day. On his bday, two months later, he of course expected the same from me. I tried my best but I have been in a bad health for last two months, so I couldn't make it.He lives 3 hours away & I don't have a car. He was mad at me but I promised to make it up to him.
So this week I decided to make this trip despite being sick(flu) & exhausted all week cuz i was feeling guilty as he said he took off & came but I couldn't do the same for him. 
So I reached at 5Pm and he called me at 6 to discuss plans.He said its 3 of us for dinner which surprised me & asked him who was the other person. He said his new girlfriend which surprised me. I still let it go cuz I thought its his day so whatever he wants. We planned to go for dinner and drinks & then both of us coming back to my hotel to chill.
They came at 8.15. I met her, she was really nice. I was very tired & bit surprised with the situation so i was a bit quiet. But I thought let it be, I have come here to chill. The dinner went fine, it was fun. we enjoyed & ate & drank & laughed.I paid the bill for all since it was my treat and then left. As we reached the hotel, she parked the car in front of the entrance like you do while dropping someone, so I thought are they not coming in. I didn't say anything and waited for my friend to say something or get out of the car, he then told me if I wanted to take the wine bottle that he had and go enjoy in my room(alone). (He said, you can take the bottle if you want and enjoy at night) 
So thats when it struck me they are not coming in, my expressions changed but I didn't say anything cuz it was awkward & i tried to act normal. I said no to the bottle & we said our goodbyes & i came back to room.
I felt so so bad cuz despite being sick and exhausted, I came to see him in another city & he told me to take the bottle & go enjoy. 
I texted him that I thought you guys were coming in. He said we were prepared to but you didn't even invite us once.
I was shocked. We had plans, i came here to just see you, why am I supposed to invite you when you and your gf are literally saying bye to me? He said you were talking throughout the dinner, why didn't you say something when we were saying goodbye, we felt you didn't want us . 
My mood got so messed up & he was like whatever happened, happened. Lets meet tomorrow.I told him i had really good time at the dinner, but we would meet some other day cuz  am in a really bad mood right now & that I wanted to leave asap All he said was thanks for everything. I replied thanku, i came here for just you & I don't think I should have had to invite you when we had plans.
I feel like this is so immature. He messed up my mood but I am feeling bad about all of it like may be i should suck it up& meet him.

AITA for banning my mom's husband from the house to make my wife feel more comfortable?,"My wife and my mom have some issues.  Nothing too severe I'd say, but I do stand by my wife and as a result  I'm not close to my family anymore. We got married a few weeks ago and  my wife was a beautiful bride.

My  wife overheard from someone, that my stepfather ""Jake's"" mom (who was  not at our wedding) asked him if she was a beautiful bride, and without  skipping a beat he said no. My wife was obviously hurt and when I  confronted him he admitted he said that and told us to stop whining, he  doesn't have to lie and he isn't obligated to think everyone is  beautiful.

I didn't totally know  what to do, because I do think the person who told my wife was just  stirring the shit. At the same time I'm not ok with anyone hurting or  disrespecting my wife. My wife wanted to ban him from our home, because  she didn't think she should have to have someone who felt that way (and  verbalized it) in her safe space.

"AITA for telling my Girlfriends daughter, that her dad kinda sucks because he and his new family went to Disneyland without her?","I’m currently in a relationship with my Gf of 4 years, and she has a daughter (we’ll call Susie) who is 7 years old, who we share with her Dad every other week. Recently we found out through the new Gf of the dad (through social media, mutual friend who makes shirts) that they had “Family shirts” done for a Disneyland trip. So we ask Susie, “why didn’t you tell us you were going to Disneyland?” out of genuine curiosity. And she looks at us confused has no idea what we’re talking about. 

Fast forward a month or so, we pick up Susie from school on the beginning of our week, and she’s going on about how much fun she had at her Grandmas house. During a school week. We then found out that the Dad, new GF, and 2 sons, had gone off on a Disneyland trip with out his ACTUAL daughter, during the school week, and couldn’t even let us have her a day early, (but that’s not that important). The 2 sons, are from the new GFs previous relationships, no way related to the Dad. We ask Susie why didn’t they take her too. And she says because then it would be an odd number and not everyone can go on the ride at the same time (or some bull crap excuse like that). 

Sometime during our week we’re in the car talking about this situation amongst my GF and I. Then Susie shouts, “they said they’re going to bring me back a gift to make up for it, and they’re going to take me next time”. I then say, “whether they bring you a gift or not, they still both suck for not taking you”. So then when she goes back on her week, she ends up telling her dad what I said, and honestly. I didn’t give a shit because I meant it. This if screwed up in my book, how do you exclude a little girl from a trip to Freaking DISNEYLAND. 

Next time we meet to exchange Susie, the dad walks up to my window and says I better keep my F****** mouth shut and stop telling my daughter bad things about him, and threatens me, and on and on. Granted, this is the first time I’ve ever said anything about the dad, because drama isn’t my thing. So I get out of the car, (because I ain’t no bitch and am size-ably larger than him, just in case if had to hold my own ground, ididnt want to have to defend myself from the seat of my car) and just explained I wasn’t lying, and asked him man to man, in front of his daughter and my Gf, “Why couldn’t Susie go with you guys to Disneyland?” He had a couple of excuses. That it was his new GFs sons first time going, and they wanted it to be about them, not that my GFs daughter couldn’t go, but because she wouldn’t have enjoyed it as much as someone who hasn’t been there before. He then also said, because she had already been there with us that she didn’t need to go this time (we had taken my GFs daughter to Disney land, the 3 of us, about 2 years ago). He then keeps going back to how he never talks bad about me (even though they do) and that he’s a good dad and that he doesn’t suck. The exchange never escalated past some mild shouting, and both parties left. 

My GF is annoyed that the situation didn’t need to happen, but does agree what the Dad and New GF did wasn’t okay. So, AITA for being honest in front of the daughter and saying her dad and “step mom” sucked. 

TLDR: Child gets excluded from Disney land family trip (Dad, Step mom, and step moms sons go, but not his biological daughter) I tell her that her Dad and Step mom suck. Dad attempts to confront me in person, but then put him on the spotlight in front of daughter, and explains that they have another trip planned for her in the future. Also says since we’ve already taken her to Disneyland, it’s okay she misses this trip. Dad claims I’m manipulating daughter, but have never said anything about Dad before. Gf gets annoyed, but agrees with me. ",Everyone Sucks
"AITA for asking my coworker to replace a charcuterie board he gave me, then asked to borrow, and then broke?","December 2020 my coworker received a large (3ft x 2 ft) wooden cutting board for Christmas from his mom. He brought it to work and asked if anyone wanted it because they did not have room for it. I leapt at the opportunity and he gave it to me (for free). It was a beautiful, custom made board from a local woodshop. I used it often for parties. About 6 weeks ago, my coworker asked if he could borrow the board for his kids’ birthday parties and his mom had some showings that she wanted to use it for (she is an interior designer). I was a little curious why they would not just use something else but this guy is on my close team and we are all “friends” so I agreed and brought it in the next day. We are having a celebration this week so I messaged said coworker and asked if I could have it back, as I needed to use it on Friday. He responded that he “would check” with his mom. Friday rolls around and I ask again if he will drop the board off at work as I need it by 4pm. He states that he reached out to his mom and at the event she held, someone dropped the board and it cracked in two. 

That was it. No offer for replacement or anything. I understand he gave me this board and it was originally his, and I did not pay anything for it. But I feel like he or his mom should replace it. Before I go nuclear with this, AITA for expecting them to replace something they gave me and then borrowed and broke? Or should I just suck it up and replace it myself?",Everyone Sucks

AITA for ignoring my friend just because he said he didn’t like me?,"I’m(15f) homeschooled and attend a virtual academy. 2 1/2 months ago, i made a server on discord with a few buds from the school. Within two weeks, everything went downhill. One of my friends, Cody(14m) has been the start of almost all the drama. 99% of it. 

The thing abt Cody is that he isn’t very socially smart. He’s really dry and rude without even realizing it, and he tends to play victim whenever we call him out on it. By “we” i mean “me” bc it’s always me who tends to be the outspoken one when he comes after me or our other friends. I’m not going to get into everything he did due to space, but feel free to ask me

i got a ToD bot for our server, and one of the questions was “who here is most likely to have a secret crush on you.” I said Cody, bc he’s had around 20 crushes (not even joking) in the past 2 months, and he admitted to having a crush on me in the past. After i said that, he started saying “EW NO! no offense” even after saying “no offense” he still kept on abt how he would never like me and making it a point to say “ew” every other word. I brought up the time he said he used to have a crush on me, and he said “that was a lie. I never liked you.” When i told him he shouldnt joke like that bc it could hurt someone’s feelings, he said “well i only lied to you, no one else”

it sucks bc im already insecure, to the point where i think no one is capable of ever liking me. And he kind of proved it further. My friends defended me and Cody started asking why we’re all being mean to him, and we were freaking out over a prank.

so today, i ignored him and anytime he said something to me i pretended not to see it while i was still talking and chatting to my friends. He started spam-pinging me and when my best friend spam-pinged him to defend me, he started being rude to her over it. He asked what was wrong with me, and said unlike us, he’s not chaotic. Even though i was mad at him, i still think it was out of line to give him silent treatment. I wouldn’t want someone to do that to me. So AITA?",Everyone Sucks
AITA for getting offended after my sister called me fat?,"In the household there are 5 girls, my youngest foster sister (12, about 100-110lbs) the second youngest foster sister (14 about 100-120) me, (15, 143lbs) my oldest foster sister, (16 about 90-105lbs) and my foster mom (— (never questioned her age) and about 200-240lbs) 

To make things simpler, we’ll just call them sister 1, sister 3, and sister 4 (oldest to youngest) 

For context, I had always struggled with my weight because of my rooted fatphobia and relapsed from an eating disorder twice. the guilt never completely left me, but I was still able to eat what I wanted without any troubles. I’ve lived in this household with sister 1 for a few months now, and I noticed that despite being the thinnest in the home, she would call herself fat. This did bother me for a while, but I usually just ignored it until sister 3 spoke up and said something insulting her weight jokingly, and I took that as an opportunity and jumped in on the conversation “yeah you are fat.” everything was intended as a joke and I think that got across but sister 1 clearly took offense and started calling me a fatass every time she saw me eating something. That fucked me up a lot, but I didn’t want to beef with anyone I lived with at the moment so I just sucked it up and didn’t eat around her to reduce how much she called me fat. it did get brought up unintentionally though, on the day after thanksgiving when my foster mom was putting away the pies, I was going to grab a slice but
my sister was in the room so I walked back to the living room and waited for her to be done with what she was doing so I could eat until she said “what? Your fatass was gonna get a slice of pie but she put them away huh?” I think that was near my snapping point because I guess how I said what I was gonna say next came off as pissed since she responded so defensively. I told her exactly what I was doing, waiting for her to leave so I could eat in peace, and it started a whole argument. she responded by calling me sensitive and how she was just returning the energy I gave her that one time I called her fat, basically saying if I couldn’t handle hearing yit then I never should have said it in the first place. when I tried to explain to her about my eating disorder and why what she said affected me, she just responded with “I know.” It really pissed me off to hear that she went and called me a fatass all this time knowing how it affected me, but I didn’t want anymore conflict so I just gave up. 

She’s been avoiding me since then, I don’t really care about reconciliation nor do I regret what I said but i want feedback because she did make some good points in her argument and I’m starting to think maybe I am just being sensitive and insecure",Everyone Sucks

AITA for calling out all the people out who don't cover shifts at my work while defending someone,"So I (17m) am working full-time at a fast food restaurant, I have left school and decided this would be the best course of action.

(That's another story I may get into if people are interested)

One night, I am working an 10 hour shift and there was only 5 people are working not including myself. Turns out that there was people who couldn't work and noone was told. The manager on shift (who has only been a manager for about 2 months) has asked 2 times for people to come in and help. Noone came in. Later in the night we are getting screwed and the manager asked me if I could just ask for people to come in. I do so but the work chat I messaged in, seemed to take it as a joke were saying things like ""maybe the manager can use his big boy words and get people to do what they were they were told."" That's night we Had 2 trainees that were cashiers  and a trainee kitchen hand all who had been hired within the past 3 weeks and were not that strong at there job.
 
I lost it and messaged the work chat saying "" this is not fair this manger has been a manger for 2 months and covers shifts. He does nearly 45 hours a week when rostered for only 22 hours. Everyone treats him shite even when he covers your shifts"" I then began to name people who had  said no because they don't want to. I said this is not fair and they should grow up and they should be ashamed.
Shortly after the franchise owner messages me and tells me that it is inappropriate to say that and I should take the message down. Now that I think about it I was angry about it and feel like an ahole

I am also the only full-time employee in the store while everyone else is casual. You may think I'm exaggerating but I am the only full time person 
I have also seen that people are saying the hours I do are illegal but technically they aren't. The Max is 38 hours per week and Max 11 per day
The reason I do more hours is not because I want to it's because I get paid 11.69 an hour which is different to my contract I have but I won't get into that

I told her it's covered, so nobody can see it anyway. She was very unhappy that I got the first tattoo but didn't stop me until I told her I wanted to extend my tattoo to my upper arm. 

The design I had in mind is to extend the tree and add another owl on my left deltoid. Some leaves and branches will peek out if I am wearing short sleeves.

AITA for taking away all my (F45) daughter's (F14) money?,"My daughter Vienna has about $2800 in savings. She got the money from saving up allowance, running errands for neighbours and selling homemade jewelry. She treasures her money a lot.

Yesterday, my son Jon (M10) told me that Vienna paid her friend to tear up his painting. He loves art and has been working on a painting of a winter landscape. The worst thing is that the painting was supposed to be for Vienna (for her Christmas present).

He was so upset, and obviously I was furious. I demanded an explanation from Vienna, and she said ""It was supposed to be for a reaction video..."" I told her I didn't care, it was a horrible thing to do. She argued again and again that it was just for fun. Jon said it wasn't funny, and was visibly hurt.

Eventually, Vienna gave a half-hearted apology. I told her that she wasn't sorry, the apology meant nothing. So, as a punishment - I told her I was going to take away all her money until I felt she deserved it again. I would also never give her allowance again.

She looked stunned and started getting hysterical. She said that was her hard-earned money, she worked for it so hard and now I was taking it away. ""All for a silly thing!"" was what Vienna said. She started crying that she was going shopping with her friends next weekend, and now she would have no money. She stormed out tearfully and locked herself in her bedroom.

Jon agreed with what I did, but he said I should give it back to her when she apologises properly. I feel it's too lenient. He's already ready to paint another landscape for her if she apologises.

My husband is totally horrified with my decision, and said it was unfair to Vienna. He said I should just ground her for a month. He thinks I'm being an asshole (and of course so does Vienna). So...AITA?

tl;dr - My daughter paid her friend to destroy my son's painting. I took away her savings as a punishment, and now my husband thinks I am an asshole.

She didn't listen and just quit her job without consulting with me. I was super mad at her. I told her I don't want to bust my ass while she relaxes at home.

3.Stick a pot pie into the oven for dinner (the occasional spaghetti or chili) 
Buy groceries
4. Drive me to school and some other fun activities that I have because I'm stressed

***IF NOT DONE THEN HE GETS OFF SCOTT FREE***

I feel like I don't have equal amount of work. He does less then I do, and his work hours are less then my school hours and he even has a extra day off, Well I've been focusing on my mental health lately and have been letting the dishes pile up, well hes been bugging me every single day to do them while I have a hundred other things to do. 

Well he told me three times today over two texts and a call, so I finally got them fucking done on my day off before school tomorrow because this is supposed to be my chill day. So I got every single dish done and it took a hour and a half. I put all the clean dishes on a towel and they ended up looking like a Jenga tower about to fall over. 

My legs hurt like fuck so I texted him that he's in charge of putting them away. Well he texted back saying ""ask if your sister will do it"" my sister is 5 and a half months pregnant and made spaghetti for dinner last night, she deserves a break because she works at a chemical factory while 18 and pregnant.

 So I went to my sister and told her not to do them and make dad do them, and she said that I'm being a ass and I should just do them, well I explained that I don't feel like my work load and my dad's are the same and she basically said suck it up. Am I wrong for planning on making my dad put away the dishes when they are almost guaranteed to fall so he'll have to clean them?

AITA for asking my neighbor to pay the vet bill after my dog instigated his to attack?,"Some background - I have a small 12 lb dog that barks a lot at other  living creatures. He's super friendly and not at all aggressive, but he  likes to say hello with a passion, which can sometimes startle people  and his barking gets very annoying when he’s out in the yard chasing  birds and squirrels.

The other night I was coming back from his nighttime walk at about  10:30pm. Neighbor a few houses away who I’ve never met is out with his  dog, who is much bigger than mine maybe \~40 lbs. The dogs will bark at  each other, my neighbor isn’t friendly, and so when we encounter each  other we typically just walk past each other as quickly as possible  pulling our respective dogs along as they both bark away. On this night  its dark and his dog is peeing on a tree, and they don't see us. I pull  my dog in close to me and work on keeping him calm, but as we get closer  he starts barking like a mad dog. My neighbor's dog gets startled, and  immediately charges at us. Neighbor has a retractable leash, and the dog  reaches the end of it and snaps around 180 degrees. He doubles back  towards us and this time the neighbor loses the leash. The dog attacks  mine and throws him up in the air. I shove the neighbor's dog aside and  pick mine up. Neighbor grabs his dog and everyone calms down. He  apologizes and swears his dog has never done anything like this. My dog  seems shaken but ok, so we go our separate ways with him saying to let  him know if we need anything.

Once I get in my house I see my dog is bleeding, shaking like crazy,  and wont' put any weight on one hind leg. So I decide better take him  into the doggy ER (at near midnight on a work night). Luckily there was  nobody else there and other than some cuts and bruising, my dog is ok.  They provide some pain meds and send us on our way with a bill of $280.

The next day I walk over to my neighbors with the bill and other ER  paperwork. He is surprised as he thought my dog was ok, and offers to  split it with me. I suggest as he is the one that lost control of his  dog, that he should pay the entire bill. I also mention that the ER  suggested I file a police report to get an official record of the  incident in case it ever happens again, which I did not do. The neighbor  flips out at me, saying my dog instigated the attack, and he lost the  leash because he’s recovering from back surgery. He says he is trying to  be nice by offering to split the bill with me, and that my response to  his neighborliness was to threaten to call the police. He further adds  that he is our rep for the HOA and that my dog is a nuisance with all of  his barking, and he could file a quality of life complaint (we don’t  let my dog out at all at night/early morning, so he’s never making noise  when noise ordinance is in effect). In the end after some back and  forth, he begrudgingly paid for the ER bill.

So reddit, AITA for asking my neighbor to pay the pet ER bill after my annoying dog instigated his to attack?

"AITA for telling my parents that they DIDN'T ""work hard for everything they've got""?","My (21F) parents are very wealthy. My dad owns a big construction company employing a lot of people and has worked on some huge projects. My mother is a fashion designer and owns two large shops selling the clothes she makes. Not going to say too much but she's designed dresses for some quite wealthy and well known people. We live comfortably and my parents have always done everything they could for me. I'm studying for an accounting degree and will always be grateful to them. 

Our lives weren't always like this however. We were very poor when I was little, and my parents had a bad lifestyle. Both my parents have been to prison. None of my friends know this but I was actually born in a jail nursery while my mother was held on robbery charges. 

The only reason they got to where we are today is because my dad ended working for a manager who felt sorry for him and trained him in skilled trade work. From that he was able to go self-employed and then got people working for him. Once he started making money he bought my mother her first shop. 

I've been seeing this guy, let's call him ""James"". He's 20 and works for my dad's company as a labourer. He hates the job. It's long hours and the money isn't great. Managers are rude and its generally a shit place to work. I've brought this up with my dad but he's just said that James ""knows where the door is"" if he doesn't like it. 

James quit yesterday because he's found another job. When I told my dad this he called him a ""useless c*nt"" who ""never wanted to work"". I said that wasn't true and that maybe he should think about how the company treats people. My dad went mad, called me ""spoiled"", and said that ""people like me and James"" expect everything without working for it. 

I said back that if not for that manager feeling sorry for my dad, they would BOTH probably be in prison right now. This made my dad even angrier and my mum got involved too. They told me to get out and I did. I'm staying with James for the moment but I don't regret what I said. I'm not saying they haven't put in a lot of work, but my dad got very lucky and we wouldn't be where we are if not for that, so they shouldn't be treating James and others that way.",Everyone Sucks
AITA - commute fight or emotional blackmail?,"My wife (27F) and I (30M) have been married for 3 years, together for 4. She recently started an internship for the next two months on the other side of our large metropolitan area that takes 1 hour to get to via mass transit (at worst 1:15 and Google says at best 40). I usually take the bus to work, which takes me about 15-30 minutes. We have a car, but she doesn’t drive yet. The internship leads to a potentially lucrative career for her as well as she progresses up the ranks in a few years (200K+).

For the first two days this week, I drove her to her internship. This took away about an hour+ of my sleep (30 min drop off, 30 min to work, 10 min walk), and cost us $15 in parking (she also had to commute back via mass transit given I’m at work). I am a very poor sleeper in terms of times / hours (average probably 4-6 a night so every hour matters in my opinion). I admit this is my fault as I stay up too late (reading, gaming, random chores, tv) and I do not have a great sleep schedule. I also do reasonably well at my job, making around $250K+ (context later). So instead of waking up at 730, I had to wake up at 630 to take her. And even that one hour less of sleep made me feel awful during the day and I couldn’t concentrate (and my job involves me thinking all day). I felt it affect my performance.

I initially suggested she just take mass transit to work, and just leave earlier because I need my sleep. She countered with just take me to the main station hub, which is just 5 min away (her walking would take 15). I said that still disrupts my sleep and doesn’t really solve the issue - I want my sleep to be productive at my job.

This is where the emotional blackmail started which included
-crying
-“I can’t believe my own husband won’t do this for me”
-“Why are you even my husband then”
-threatening “I’ll do what I want” when I try to find a solution
-cold shouldering / ignoring now
-“my own husband”

Keep in mind, I’m trying to be reasonable / rationale and not get emotional, but I do say she is emotionally blackmailing me. I probably got somewhat emotional / loud in the argument as well - “my one hour is worth less than $25 to you”.

My ultimate solution was why don’t we just get an uber? It would cost $20-$25, allow both to sleep more, she could leave as she wanted, and it’s safer (mass transit can be sketchy here) and quicker. At most it’s for two months as she will hopefully start driving soon and we can afford it. However, she wants to save $$$ (which I sincerely appreciate cause we are single income right now) but I’d rather be able to think straight and have her have a safe, quick commute.

Or, should I just suck it up given it’s only two months and fix my sleep schedule overnight (which has been messed up now for 3+ years). I really do value every hour (I have massive bags under eyes).

TLDR: AITA? wife and I fight over morning commute. Emotional abuse / blackmail / manipulation - is it there? What is the solution? We are both stubborn.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for (F23) making my great aunt (F65) cry ?,"Throwaway account.

My great aunt was diagnosed with cancer when I was around 13 years old. Thankfully she went into remission when I was 16, but now at age 23, her cancer is back. This has obviously been very sad for our family, and we have all pitched in somehow to help her out with this process. The doctors say her chances are very good, so we are not too worried.

I have 2 younger brothers, but I have my own apartment, work full time + am in school, And am also ring shopping with my bf, so life has gotten very busy for me. I try my best to balance everything, but it is growing more and more difficult. 

Ever since her diagnosis, my aunt has called my brothers and I about 3 times a day. A lot of it isn't even something important, it's just to talk about random stuff. This is fine every once in a while but my brother is applying for pharmacy school, and so we are all very busy. We do all call/text her about once a day , so it's not like we are completely ignoring her.

Last week she sent a gift to my parents house for my birthday, and I made a mental note to thank her. A week passed and it completely slipped my mind. Come today, she texted  me about it and I apologized and thanked her. she then called me and goes off on me about how I am completely ungrateful and that she can't believe I didn't mention anything about her gift. she told me I was raised better than that and something in me just snapped. I told her we were all very busy and that we are trying our best, but we can't just be available at her beck and call whenever she wants.

She began crying and hung up the phone. She told my parents she wouldn't be calling us as much anymore and My parents are pissed at me but my brothers are very grateful since they are able to focus more on school now.

AITA?

TL;DR: I forgot to thank my aunt for a birthday gift she gave me a week ago. She has cancer and is going through rough times. She called me and called me ungrateful so I argued back and made her cry. 

I forgot to text my aunt a that jcyou",Everyone Sucks
AITA for getting mad at my brother?,"A little context, this all happened really early in the morning after a full night of me not getting any sleep. 

I (25f) live with my brother (28m) and I have 2 cats and he has one cat. I leave my bedroom door open so both of my cats can go in and out as they please and I don’t have to get up and down all the time to let them in and out. Well, as a result of me leaving my door open, my brothers car naturally comes into my room every once in a while.

This morning, my brothers cat comes in at around 4:40 am and starts getting into stuff, so I put everything away she was getting into and gently pick her up and put her out of my room and lay back down, trying to sleep. Keep in mind, this is happening after me not getting any sleep up until this point. So I’m laying there trying to sleep and my brothers cat come back into my room and knocks some valuable things over, one of them being my tool that I use to smoke concentrate with. So I yell “goddamn it” and pick her up again and put her out of my room and close the door this time. Well around 5:45ish in the morning, after I had just fallen asleep, I am woken up by my brother BLARING his tv (keep in mind he sleep out in the family room in the basement which is right next to my room because he doesn’t have a bed in his room and doesn’t want to sleep on the floor, understandably so). 

So I got out there, and he looks at me and says “yeah sucks to be woken up huh?” And we get into this huge fight and I ended calling him selfish. 

Am I the asshole?

TLDR; my brothers cat come in my room after me not sleeping all night and breaks some stuff, I get mad and yell at the cat, he wakes me up by blaring his tv and we fight",Everyone Sucks
WIBTA if i don't explain to my sister why i am asking a question before asking a question?,"I (27M) started to see that my sister, Laura (21F) developed a new behaviour in the last 2 years. Laura will get cautious and want explanation if i ask a question (generally speaking: about her life).

Example situation:
*
Laura and i both moved to the same city, i am working, Laura just started university, parents live in our hometown. I am living in the city for 3 years now, Laura moved there 3 months ago. One of my friends started a little music band and they invited me to their concert for a Saturday night. I thought it would be nice to ask Laura to come with me to a program in the new city. The conversation:

Me: ""Hi, will you be in the city or hometown for the weekend?""
Laura: ""Why?""
Me: ""I love that you can't answer the question first.""
Laura: ""My answer depends on why you are asking the question.""
Me: ""One of my friends will have a concert on Saturday night in the city and i wanted to ask if you would like to come with me.""
Laura: ""Ohh i already have a program for that time, so thanks, but i cannot come now.""
*

This was our last problematic conversation, because i am not making a big fuss about it and i realized Laura feels comfortable to answer questions that way, so after the example situation i have been always explaning my questions beforehand to her. That being said i think the ""Why?"" reaction can be harsh from Laura, and i realized that even she does not always ask questions to me the way she would expect me (~20% of all time she asks me questions the way i explained in the example, but i always answer her anyway).

Bigger problem comes when our father, David(50M) and Laura get in a similar situation, because both of them can be headstrong.

Example situation:
*
Parents and Laura are at home in hometown on a weekend, David is fixing a shelf in the living room and he has a hard time doing it alone, Laura is chilling in a separate room. David wants Laura to hold the shelf, while he fixes the screws. The conversation:

David: ""Laura, come here!""
Laura: ""Why?""
David: ""Because i told you to come.""
Laura: ""Why would you want me to come?""
David: ""I told you to come, why can't you come already?""
Laura: ""Because you don't tell me why you want me to come.""
*

And this goes on and on across the rooms with loud voices till one of them yields to the other. They can go through this conversation a lot in any kind of situations, and they always make a little fight about it. Mostly David thinks Laura is too defensive with her own father and sets him up as a bothersome stranger with her behaviour, Laura thinks David is uncooperative and she is reasonable when she needs an explanation before responding to anything.


So as i was saying i now explain my question to Laura beforehand, but WIBTA if i kept asking questions the same way and if i reacted as my father?",Everyone Sucks
AITA for complaining to my boyfriend instead of talking to my roommate?,"Just so you know the issue that broke the camels back. I have been having problems with my roommates a lot. While i know I also suck as a roommate, they have been super passive aggressive. I don't know if they realize it but its been definitely rude (coming off at least). They have been super messy the whole time we have been living together. I was too in the begining so I try not too fault them too much but I feel like they arent even trying to fix it. By messy I mean leaving dishes in the sink for months and cups of tea on the counter/table till it molds. They leave countless shoes jackets out and have overloaded the fridge so that I can't get anything into it. They have now started to use the freezer that me and my boyfriend bought to have a part of a cow. And had been throwing stuff just in there. At one point the freezer was a month old and they threw open package of chicken nuggets in getting them everywhere. They constantly forget their laundry in the washer and dryer. So no one else can do their laundry unless you want to take theirs out. I have a lot of problems. I will also do some of those things but I have been trying to fix my behaviors. They recently texted us that we cant use their food. It was very passive and accusatory (In the past we have all shared food. This is also when they stared to file the fridge.)  Before this me and my boyfriend had bought chicken nuggets and they eat them all. Where we got none of two 10lbs bags. And then after this is when they started to do this. I had recently bought myself some hot chocolate and marshmallows this literally cost me 4$  and there were two bags of marshmallows. I had opened one bag to use. My roommate opened my other bag to make them self a cup and i hate when marshmallows go stale. I texted my boyfriend that i ask annoyed about it. Because they like to bitch about others eating their food. And my boyfriend escalated it by sending out a group chat saying don't take others food. They are all pissed because I was annoyed by it. So now i have two open bags of marshmallow's i cant eat before they stale up and pissed roommates. Im sorry i am really bad at English no excuse but thinks if you read it.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for yelling at my partner to clean the dishes?,"So my (24m) husband (28m) have started living on a  semi-off grid farm, about a year and a half ago. One of the effects of that, is for the time being we don't have hot water running in our home. We usually boil water or we will go to my uncles house (our neighbor) and get some hot water for tasks we need it for.
We also usually divide chores/errands pretty evenly, he works during the day so I take care of our farm critters, as well as take care of any handyman needs, such as (eventually) setting up a hot water heater.
One of the chores he agreed to do was the dishes, mostly because I have a bit of trauma from childhood that surrounds doing the dishes (as well as cooking). Before we moved here he did the dishes pretty regularly. He has adhd and I'm on the spectrum, so we definitely fall behind a bit on chores, but generally they would get done within a week or two.
Now that we've moved, that's become less frequent, which I understand. 
However, he got into the habit of only cleaning the dishes we needed, which led to a large pile of dishes being left in the sink for a very long time. Eventually they started to smell badly, so he put the outside on the porch. I would ask him to do the dishes maybe once every couple weeks, and he would say he would do them. But that was almost 4 months ago. 
I finally snapped today and started yelling about how he hasn't done this one chore in months, and if he would just ask me for help I would have done them, but because of my trauma and his promise he would be doing them, I hadn't stepped in. I finally did them all today, and nearly all the metal silverware were rusty, including the mixer pieces.
I pointed this out, and said that I had only been able to use the mixer once before it had been left outside to rust, and his response was ""waste of money then huh?""
Well now we've been fighting for hours, he keeps saying I have to stop talking about it so he can calm down. He has not thanked me for doing the dishes, and he has not even admitted any sort of responsibility for ruining so many dishes.
I do feel really bad for yelling at him, but I also feel like I was at my wits end. It smelled so bad yall. 
Anyways, TLDR husband left dirty dishes outside for 4 months until they rusted and then said I was being the asshole because I yelled at him, after I had to clean the rusty old dishes.

EDIT: because I think people are assuming a few things, 
we both do all the housework together, at the same time, and usually play music or a documentary while we do. The ONLY chores we have ""labeled"" as one or the others is the dishes, and the cat boxes. He does the dishes (usually) because he offered to, on his own, without me asking, before we moved out here. and I do the cat boxes, because he doesn't like to and he does the dishes. We both take turns on all other chores.
We aren't leaning on our disabilities. Everyone has different limits and different ways of coping. The only reason I didn't just do those dishes months ago, is because any time I tried, he would take them and say things like ""no that's my chore I would feel bad""
And as for my trauma and how I need to ""heal"" from it, kindly remember that none of you know why, when, or how severe this trauma is, or what I've been doing to heal. I have a therapist, and am working on it. I did the dishes today, which is a step for me. We both do a lot, and yes, it's stressful, but we are happy. This is one incident I was hoping to get an outside perspective on, not an invitation to attack me and my partners mental state or disabilities. Not saying we don't both suck, just a lot of assumptions and some kinda ableist stuff is popping up in the comments and I'm not really cool with. Even if I am the ass, that's not needed.

Edit #2 because I have a clearer head today.
First, I did the dishes for myself and my roommate daily until I met my partner, and we took turns with them until he offered to take over the chore. I never have refused to do them, and have done them here and there since he offered that.
His mom visited about 3 months ago and when she did he moved the bucket of dishes behind the feed cans on the porch, so I didn't know they were there. When I found them yesterday morning it started the fight and I took them and did the dishes within an hour of finding them. If he had just left them inside I would have done them way sooner, I just didn't know they were there.
We have also done dishes within this 4 months, it was just not all of them. What he hid was pots, pans, a couple cups, and silverware. Our plates and bowls and such were getting washed.
Lastly, we moved here because my grandparents both had intensive surgeries within a year and are getting up there, and needed a caretaker. So most of my day when he's at work is taking care of them, and doing THEIR dishes and other chores. Which I don't mind. But I also don't like the assumption that because these few dishes fell through the cracks that I was allowing it to happen. I'm not a great writer and like, I have autism and some other shit goin on, so I probably didn't come across as very clear yesterday. I was full of emotions and stuff. Anyways, we don't just not clean, and it wasn't all of our dishes. Anyways, looks like we both suck, which I agree with. Peace.",Everyone Sucks

AITA for getting angry at my sister during a family dinner,"I (m32) went to my parents house to visit for a weekend as the whole family was there. My parents and my two brothers and my sister were also staying for the weekend. It’s been about 2 years since the whole family has seen each other so we had lots of things to tell each other. I am a travel nurse and I have been going around to different parts of the country to maximize my profits. I was telling my family about this at dinner and everyone seemed happy about it and were talking about how tough it is because I’ve been traveling around working to provide for my kids and wife with cancer. I talk about the different things I do as a travel nurse and when I mentioned how I recently filled in for a hospital who was on strike, my sister starts flipping out. She calls me many horrible things like class traitor and greedy piece of shit right in front of my face so I start yelling back at her telling her I need to pay for my wife’s cancer treatment and provide for my children, and if I could make enough money at a regular hospital I would. By now it’s chaotic with everyone trying to calm each other down, yelling… and my sister eventually gets up angry and yelling how she doesn’t want to sit with a class traitor. We come from a poor family. When she’s leaving I tell her “piece of shit I hope your husband gets cancer so you understand you spoiled f*cling brat” and my parents start yelling at me. My mother said I ruined the dinner, so I just also left early and did not go back. AITA?

AITA for yelling at the girl who caused my son's ED?,"I want to start off by saying this is a throwaway account, so please disregard the lack of posts.

My wife (39f) and I (40m) have a son Keegan (16m) together. He’s our only child and he means THE WORLD to us.

A few months ago, we noticed Keegan had started skipping meals, saying he had a lot to eat at school and just didn’t have room to fit dinner. We didn’t think much of it as Keegan always had a small appetite since he was a young child. He had also lost a bit of weight, but he said he worked really hard in soccer. But, we soon came to regret believing what we found out were lies.

At a school conference, we talked about many things with his few teachers and me and my wife thanked his teachers for providing lunch for their students (he goes to an alternative high school, where the environment is a lot smaller than an actual school). It turns out, Keegan NEVER ate the school lunches there. He was only eating an orange daily for THREE MONTHS!! He’s also very forgetful, and would even forget to grab something to eat at least half of the week.

My wife and I felt devastated we hadn’t noticed sooner. We had a talk together about how to approach this, and we had a talk with Keegan. We made sure to let him know we’re here for him and we love him dearly and want to help him however we can.

He broke down and told us there was a girl Riley who was bullying him for “being fat” and told him he should stop eating, so he followed through (he was 5’5” and \~150 lbs prior to his ED).

My wife and I felt ANGRY and took Keegan to a nutritionist where he was diagnosed with anorexia. He had lost 35 lbs over the course of his eating disorder. We made sure he would get enough to eat (slowly but surely per recommended by his doctor). We told him he isn’t fat AT ALL, but he feels incredibly insecure about his body now, especially his stomach and legs. My wife and I feel so hurt seeing him go through this. He already suffers from severe depression and anxiety and can hardly go to school every day, so this is just yet another topping to the pizza for him.

The next day, I went into school with Keegan, and I talked to his teachers about the situation. All of them felt horrible about what happened and brought in the girl in question. Once the door was closed, I lost my temper and started yelling at her, about how hurt my son was over this. I really didn’t intend to, but the damage had already been done.

What made me even angrier is she said (not exactly, just paraphrased as well as possible) “I don’t see the problem. Boys can’t be affected by weight comments.”

Before I could yell at her again, I was told to leave and they would handle the situation.

My wife and our parents are furious with me about yelling at a young girl who probably doesn’t know better. I know it was wrong, but holy shit, she’s the same age as Keegan! High schoolers know bullying is wrong! She doesn’t even know she caused his anorexia!

I know I am at least a little bit, but how much AITA for this?

AITA for telling my boyfriend that my best friend has a better ass than him?,"I (F22) started dating Jacob (M22) about a year and a half ago. We've had our ups and downs, but it's honestly been great. However, even if he's never admitted it, Jacob isn't a huge fan of my best guy friend Damian (M20), who I've known for four years. I had unrequited feelings for Damian for the first two years of our friendship, but I eventually got over him before meeting Jacob. I told Jacob this when we first started dating, as I wanted to be transparent with him. Jacob was a little uncomfortable, but he agreed that it was ultimately in the past and he'd get over it.

In the past year and a half of us dating, Jacob has only gotten to see Damian a handful of times at events, as Damian goes to a different college than us. They've had a few civil talks, but Jacob never really takes the initiative to approach Damian, and Jacob can sometimes be short and quiet with him. If Jacob is with me when Damian facetimes me, Damian will say hi and Jacob never says hi back. And back in April, some friends and I wanted to go down to Damian's college city and watch him perform in a play at his school. But Jacob said he wasn't really feeling up for the 3 hour drive (He's the only one of us that has a car). I was pissed at this point and asked why Jacob had issues with Damian and if he trusted me, and he got defensive, saying I was overthinking it. He said Damian was chill to him, though I also pointed out that I genuinely don't have any issues with Jacob's best girl friend Michelle (F21), and we even drove 6 hours to her college city back in January for her improv show. Jacob said again he wasn't feeling the drive, and he was sorry. I want to believe Jacob has no issues with Damian, but I don't know. I know Damian and our friends have had their suspicions about Jacob disliking Damian, and I've tried to assure them it's false.

Cut to yesterday, and Damian and some of my friends came to visit my college city for the weekend. Michelle and some of Jacob's friends came too. We all threw a party at my apartment with my college friends, and a good amount of us got pretty drunk, including me, Damian, Jacob, and Michelle. Michelle came up to me, laughing and saying Jacob told her she has a better bust than me. Furious and intoxicated, I stormed up to Jacob and confronted him, calling him an asshole. Jacob told me it was just a joke and to quit bitchin about it. At that point, I dropped a genuine opinion of mine, saying Damian had a better ass than Jacob. Well, Jacob didn't take it well, cursing up a storm, accusing me of being a baby, and saying I was being serious while he was just kidding.

AITA for accepting to babysit my friends child without checking with my bf first?,"My (32F) bf (29M) and I live together.  We have a couple who are friends of ours who have a 2yo toddler (we have no children).  She is the cutest little kid.  My bf isn't a kid person, he doesn't dislike her or anything, but he doesn't go out of his way to interact with her when we see them, like I do.  They had a get together earlier this week, and while we were there, the wife started talking about how she and her husband haven't had a night out in a while.  I told her that if they wanted to go do something on Friday, I would be happy to watch their daughter.  I already knew I didn't have plans, and I knew that my bf didn't have any plans at the house or anything, so bringing her to our house wouldn't be a problem.  She thanked me and confirmed with her husband that he was available on Friday.  The morning after the party, I mentioned to my bf that I was going to watch their daughter on Friday so they could go out.  He got annoyed and said I should have asked him before offering.  I said he didn't have to do anything, he didn't even need to be there if he didn't want to, I wasn't expecting him to help.  He said that at the party, he had asked a couple of the guys to come over on Friday, and didn't want a little kid running around bothering them.  I said I would entertain her separately so it wouldn't be a problem.

That's exactly what happened.  They dropped her off after my bf's friends were already here, I took her into another room, we played games and watched tv until they picked her up, and that's it.  My bf is still acting salty this morning because I didn't talk to him first.  AITA?

Edit: I've seen this question a few times.  I was watching her at our house instead of theirs' because they live about 45 min. outside of town, and we live in town.

AITA for refusing to speak to my bf after he took my car off the road?,"I've never had a drivers license.My bf would get me to work and back,and if he couldn't,I made other plans.I decided to get my G1 and got a car.I'm a nervous driver. One day,I was driving,hit ice and slid towards a bunch of kids on a curb.I did manage to stop after going sideways.I got home and haven't gotten behind the wheel again.Our city has crazy drivers.I can usually accomplish anything, but this one might take time.

He totaled my first car, and I got another car and paid the insurance and put my mom on, but in his name. A few months ago..he mentioned that he wanted the car out of his name. My mom cant get insurance. He then got into a fight with her and decided she couldn't drive my car and pulled the plates. She was how I got to work,physio 3 days a week,etc.Everything.It was fine that she took me everywhere so that he didnt have to.

I decided to put it in my sons name.I can get home from work but always struggle to get there because my son works late.I havent been able to get insulin I need, etc. Since then,my bf wont take me to or from work. He says it's not his responsibility. He's made my son get up to get me at 6 am on his day off even though bf was already up for work. Bf will nap after work and be awake for when I come home and still my son has to get me.This happened while I was on modified work for an injury and had little income.

When we had just his old car, I would pay for gas, oil changes,parts; whatever we needed. When I had my car and his didnt work,he used mine and I paid people to bring me to work. He never paid for anything. I needed 2 oil changes since and I needed to replace parts to pass safety that were damaged while he drove it. Now he got a newer car and decided that he doesnt want the responsibility of my car. I paid for it all. 

I tried to talk to him about how this would reflect on me and how much I'm struggling and he told me to quit being mad and ""suck it up and get over it""
I stood by him through a criminal charge,a trial,through job losses,through his mom then his dad dying. I've dropped everything and did whatever he needed,even if it meant being in a hot car for entire weekends while they visited his father.I've covered bills when he couldnt. When he was getting kicked out,I moved him in so he wouldnt be homeless.If something needs to be done for the team, I do it. I feel like our relationship is completely one sided and he just lets me deal with everything. He barely does any chores,and when we got a shut off notice for hydro, he told me ""oh well, I dont have any money for the next 3 weeks cause of my car payment."". I have to make sure everything gets paid on time,which seems ironic since he made it so much harder for me to get to work. I've never depended on him for anything but a steady way to work. I feel like if I'm doing everything alone, maybe I just should be. It's not even just about the car anymore.

"AITA for letting our skink fill with rust, mold, and fruit flies?","I (25F) found an ad for a room for rent and really liked the landlord, who would also by my room mate (31F). She told me that I would have my own private bedroom, and the bathroom, kitchen, and common areas would be shared between the two of us. She gave me designated kitchen cabinets and half of the fridge/ freezer space. One day, my room mate informs me that her SIL got a job close to our house and would be living with us for 3 days a week for 4 months. I was not thrilled at the idea but I did not complain. Almost immediately, the SIL started putting her groceries away in my kitchen cabinets, and I would move them to my room mates cabinets. Same thing in the fridge and freezer, and with my dishes. My room mate and I have always had a very peaceful and good relationship so I didn’t want to be petty and complain over something small. Then my room mate goes out of town for a few weeks, and the SIL has her husband over and they bring their dog. They are very loud, have loud shower sex, and lock the dog out of the bedroom so they don’t have to hear it bark and scratch. The dog actually made a hole on the floor in front of MY bedroom door from scratching trying to get in. At this point I’m very frustrated but still do not complain. Then one day I come home and the kitchen is a WRECK. They left dishes in the sink, a frying pan full of oil on the stove, McDonald’s wrappers on the counter, and just an overall messy kitchen. Now no where along the way did I agree to clean up after her family members so I did not. I left the mess there. The SIL only stays here 3 days a week, left the kitchen a mess and then went back to her house. I guess she told my landlord that she could sense tension or that I didn’t want her there and that she wouldn’t be coming back. My landlord did not communicate to me that the SIL wasn’t coming back, so I assumed she would be back, and left her mess there for her to clean up. I work a lot so the mess wasn’t really bothering me. My room mate comes home a few weeks later to the mess, the dishes were covered in mold, there was rust in the sink, fruit flies in the kitchen, the frying oil, McDonald’s wrappers and trash. Now she is being passive aggressive with me. I saw her as I was on my way out for the day and I said “hi welcome home” and she said “yes it feels good to be back, go out and have fun, don’t worry I got us, I’ll clean up this mess” passive aggressively.

If Johanna invited Allie to a movie, Allie was suddenly super busy and had no time. If Johanna wanted to come with Allie to a party, Johanna wasn't invited and there was no way she could bring her. She'd rip up Joanna's things and would blame Johanna when she'd be grounded. 

Just the run of the mill petty teenager bullstink. Johanna was a good sport and always seemed to take things on the chin. Her explanation was always that ""sisters fight"". Until about maybe three or four summers ago Allie was home from college and was going through a rough breakup that was causing her grades to tank which put her on academic probation. Allie was upset and was taking it out on everyone, especially Johanna. My wife and I told her to cut it out and she seemed to catch on that her behavior wasn't gonna be accepted. Come to find out after Allie leaves to go back to college that she'd completely destroyed Johanna's scrapbook with pictures of her dad and destroyed a lot of the shirts she had left of his. Johanna didn't make a stink about it in front of us but that night the house stunk of E6000 and mod podge. You could guess what she spent the night doing. After that incident Johanna had completely given up on Allie. Allie has a birthday coming up, Johanna wouldn't even sign the card. Allie is in town for the weekend, unless it's a holiday or family event, Johanna wasn't there. And honestly we didn't blame her.

Now the issue is that Allie wants Johanna to let things go and let bygones be bygones. Johanna is getting married soon, and Allie wants an invite. It was brought up this past week at a family dinner (Johanna and her fiance as well as their son attended/Allie and her wife and two girls attended as well). Allie brought up how the kids were the same age and how it'd be cool after the wedding if the kids could hang out. Allie also asked what she should wear to Johanna's wedding and if she'd be a bridesmaid. Johanna pretty much laid it out for Allie that she wasn't coming and that the kids wouldn't be seeing each other outside of family events.The night was pretty tense afterwards and I asked Johanna if there was any way she could forgive Allie. She said she wanted nothing to do with her and I told her I fully understand that she carries a lot of hurt from how Allie treated her. Allie came to me after Johanna left and pretty much begged me to convince Johanna to move past things. I told her that had she been a more considerate and kind person back then that maybe she'd have a chance at a relationship with her stepsister. I told her that she made her bed and she needs to lay in it. She said I'm a a-hole and that any good father would want to see his kids reunite. 

AITA for telling her she deserves this?

Info: For everyone asking and making assumptions about my parenting, Allie was never allowed to slide with anything she did to her sister. She was grounded, she had things taken from her, we replaced the things we would that she broke and we made sure Johanna was supported and validated throughout the years. We never told Johanna to get over anything, we never told her she had to forgive Allie. When we offered Allie therapy, she was 14. We weren't going to force our daughter to go to therapy where chances were, she could just tell her therapist she didn't want to be there and be uncooperative, and most likely have the therapist stop seeing her as we can't and weren't gonna force a kid to be somewhere she didn't want to be, just for her to lash out at her sister even worse.
When Allie destroyed those things she was banned from coming back until she apologized and made things right by Johanna. Johanna said herself she didn't want the apology and my wife and I did our best to surround her with love while she was grieving the loss of those things she cared for. Johanna moved out so the punishment was moot. We are aware Allie sucks, we did everything we could within reason. I didn't raise Allie to be this way,we didn't encourage this nor did we allow her to believe the behavior was acceptable.

Edit: This thread is an absolute pit of people who don't seem to understand some kids just aren't receptive. I'm kind of done seeking internet help here, you all seem wonderful and I'll be sure that on the next go around I toss my kid to a psych ward and pit all blame on the Healthcare system for not fixing them.

AITA? My girlfriend has caused a mosquito infestation.,"Hello, fellow Redditors. *tips hat* My GF left a plastic wash-basin of murky water and dirty dishes in the kitchen sink for so long that it became an abode of mosquitoes. Perhaps some of you don't know this, and that's fine, because not everyone is obsessed with insects, but those fuckers begin their life cycle in water. Whole-ass breeding colony of mosquitoes in the house.

I told her to maybe step up her housekeeping game. That it's not cool to have food around as bait for the kitchen moths and various species of mold. But maybe when there are MOSQUITOES BREEDING IN THE FUCKING HOUSE, I think a line may have been crossed.

She felt attacked and wounded and was upset with me.

AITA for not being excited about my s/o’s dogs existence,"So my s/o knows I never cared for dogs, they’re just not my cup of tea. I wouldn’t harm one what so ever. I just don’t like to be around them.  I don’t find them cute. Entertaining or lovable.  The majority of them  gross me out.  (For some reason I do really love pugs) Plus the fact that I’m extremely allergic to them anyway. 


My s/o and his ex share a dog, he normally gets the dog one week every month.  I’ve met the dog once. It was a nightmare, it constantly wanted to be around me no matter how much I tried to ignore it and not make eye contact. And I got the worst allergies ever. It sucked existing around it.  But I endured. I didn’t treat it badly. I always ended up either moving away from it or picking it up and putting it back on the floor whenever it wanted to snuggle me. 

My s/o always hyped up his dog.  And that’s cool. I get loving your pet.  I just don’t really care to hype up the pet with him.  Today is his week with his dog, and he tried to get me excited about it. And hype up with him. I gave him a monotoned “yay” and replied “cool” while on my phone. Honestly not really caring. He got upset telling me that I could at least try to be excited for him.  I responded by being sarcastic and faking enthusiasm which made him even more upset.  So now he’s ignoring me and playing with his dog and making passive aggressive remarks everytime I pass by.  Like “it’s okay. The majority of us love you being here” while glaring at me. Which got under my skin in which I said “I’m sorry I don’t care about your damn dog”

I just feel like I haven’t done anything wrong. He knew from day one that I don’t care about dogs.  That includes his dog. Did he think just because I love him means id love his dog?",Everyone Sucks
AITA for not wanting to do the shopping on my birthday?,"I (m28) asked SO (f33) if when we went to the supermarket we could not do the whole shop for the week and just grab my birthday cake which is all we went in for initially. 

For context my SO and I live together and have been together about five years now. The supermarket we went to is about a ten minute walk from the house but as it was my birthday and I didn’t want to spend ages doing it I drove my SO and I there as she wanted to get me a cake and would like my input so agreed to go. We enter and immediately she asked if we need a basket to carry the items I said no as we were only meant to be getting a cake and wanted to avoid her having the space to start piling things in, as I said I wanted to be in and out with one thing. She then proceeds to start shopping for salad and what she wants to have throughout the week including chicken and shampoo to the point she needs to go and get a basket to carry everything she has. So there I am on my birthday stood waiting in the cold section next to a basket of food shopping I didn’t want to start in the first place and having already asked if she could do this later repeatedly was told I was being unreasonable and she can just get it now. She has a history of doing things like this where she will say we are going for one thing then tack on everything we need to get and on my birthday I just wanted one time where I’m not dragged into it. Any other day I would’ve been fine because as far as a shop goes it wasn’t crazy I just didn’t want to spend time on my day doing it. And wanted to relax at home and just spend time with her not doing chores. 

She then proceeds to give me the silent treatment and leave the groceries she so desperately needed to get that second in the hallway not bothering to put them away (this is normally my task). She could’ve gone after work to get them or even the next day nothing she got was time critical and I didn’t have to be there. 

We are now in an argument with her calling me unreasonable for not wanting to do it and me saying it’s pathetic that she wants to do this to me on my birthday (admittedly not great of me but she refused to apologise or acknowledge why I might be upset). She has also ruined a couple of previous birthdays e.g. I had a small gathering a few years ago and really would’ve loved her company but refused as she said she didn’t want to meet my friends.
I just feel it’s like she doesn’t care because it isn’t her birthday even though we do whatever she wants on hers. Admittedly in the spirit of fairness she did want to spend some time looking for a gift for me near her birthday but not on the day and also after me saying we don’t need ti as it wasn’t a big deal for me that we do it right there and then.

AITA for getting mad at my mom for telling at me over something I cant control,"This just happened. I'm in my bed, crying my eyes out because of my mom. 

I, 16f, have a Samsung phone. And one thing about Samsung and android is that if you have data, it's on or off. You cant control which apps are on or off. You either use it or dont. 

And if you have airplane mode off, messages through your phone number won't come through as they need internet connection without airplane mode. 

My mom, 43f, has an apple which you CAN control. 

Mom came into my room, asking why I wasn't answering her messages. I hadn't gotten any. She demands why I'm ignoring her, and not answering on messenger or messages. 

I tell her I dont have access to my messenger account or my Facebook account, as I created the account years ago and recently swapped phones, and it for some reason didnt transfer my phones data. 

She keeps demanding why, and I'm getting more upset. Ngl its partially my fault, I've been defiant and haven't taken my meds in a few days so I know I'm a little over emotional but still. 

She takes my phone and begins to try and fix what happened, all while scolding me for not already setting it up. By this point I'm already in tears, frustrated as this isn't the first time I've told her I dont have my account.

Once it's set up, she begins snapping at me for having my phone on airplane mode in the first place. I keep shooting back how I have it off because the moment I go over my data, she screams at me and makes me feel like garbage. 

I'm full on sobbing(I'm sensitive with trauma from my dad, ok?) And keep telling her I cant keep it on because I don't want to get yelled at for wasting my data and being irresponsible.

But she keeps telling me I just dont waste it. 

But guess what, mom! Even just leaving my phone on the table while I'm at school with my data on uses it! Everytime I get a notification, or pick it up to use it for 5 freaking seconds, I'm using my data! 

That's why I leave it off, I dont want to waste it. 

She gets mad i keep arguing, i yell back that she isn't listening to me. She keeps telling me I'm being dramatic, I'm acting like a baby, blah blah blah. Finally I demand she leaves my room and in the most petty, childish way she does. Slamming my door behind her, storming down the hall and then slamming her door on the opposite side of the house. 

I know I'm going to get comments saying I should be grateful cause my mom pays for my data but I'm freaking 16, and I work a part time job. Even if I wanted to, I really couldn't afford to pay. SHE offered that, then makes me feel bad for it.

AITA for asking my son has a little d*ck?,"I really look like an asshole but let me explain.

Me and my wife(47M,52F) have two kids,J(26M) and K(24M). J always has been the easy one to raise. Although he was a teenager who had a wild partying era and as an individual who has ADHD(diagnosed by a pediatrician and managed by a psychiatrist), he always knew his responsibilities,was a hard worker and he always has been a compassionate human being against others and he is currently engaged to our Son-in-law H(28M). K is a whole different story. 

K always has been the troublemaker in the school. If we weren't called by his schools for a month,we would celebrate secretly. He always had anger bursts and he never respected his friends, teachers or us and at age 14,he started to hang with alt-right groups which raged his beliefs about misogyny and after an incident,he was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and he refused therapy and treatment. We had to kick him out 4 years ago from our house because he was an utter jerk to his brother and BIL. He was also a part of Proud Boys before they were deemed as a terrorist organisation and he can't hold any kind of government jobs anymore due to this. He is only allowed to visit when his brother or BIL isn't around and our interactions are fairly limited. He probably also has psychotic episodes and another problems at this point but he refuses to get help. 

Last week, while he was at our house he saw the photos of his brother's engagement. J has asked not to tell him unless he does but he sneaked into our room and saw the photos at my iPad. He raged down and yelled us for not informing about his brother's big step. At first I was mad that he looked through my belongings but as the argument continued I started to sense the insecurity.
I laughed and said ""Aren't you sure you have a little d*ck problem that makes you speak like this?"" He looked at me shocked and left the house. Later I learned he called his grandparents and they said I was a big c*nt for insulting him but my wife thinks he deserved it. So,AITA?",Everyone Sucks

She says ""Negative, well sometimes, but no. WE(Ex wife and our daughter) will still be attending. You can meet us there."" She has full custody.  Everytime me and my ex wife are together, she disrespects me. I can't even ask a simple question without getting an attitude. I can't say anything to her or the kids. Anytime I say something to them she doesn't agree with, it's an argument right in front of the kids. Anytime I say something to them she does agree with, she makes it a point to tell the kids what I said was right. I responded by saying ""If I'm paying, you're not coming unless it's an event or ceremony. It's going to be a father/son time. Make your decision."" She sent a laughing emoji and ✌🏿.

AITA for telling an overweight person that they were in no position to give me advice on my weight?,"I (17m) am pretty skinny and don't eat much. I've always been like this and I don't know why, I've always had a small stomach and got full pretty quickly. There's this girl (16f) that kinda invited her-self to the friend group but no one's really said anything. She is quite large but I never cared because it isn't my problem. What I did care about though is the fact that anytime I'm eating and ask somebody if they want some since I'm full or if I ask somebody if they wanna take some of my food since I can't finish it she will always say something like ""Omg your so skinny you should eat more"". ""That's all you can eat?. That's barely anything"". I always say something along the lines of, ""just eat your own food"", ""I have a smaller stomach"", ""you just have a bigger stomach"", etc. 

My final straw was on Friday when I was inputting height and weight information into a card thing that I had to submit for a wrestling tournament. She saw it and was like ""YOUR THAT LIGHT, YOU SHOULD BE EATING SO MUCH MORE."" I was just mad at this point and said ""Look at you, you look like an oversized land whale you should be in no position to be talking about MY weight."" She yelled numerous insults at me then stormed away. I immediately felt awful for how far I took it but she was already of and I started to think that she kinda deserved it because she wouldn't stop talking about my weight despite me telling her to stop, but my friends are all telling me I took it to far and that I should have just clearly told her to stop and I am starting to think they are right and that I took it to far.

AITA for arguing with my mom because she didn't want people to understand I'm bisexual?,"I am a bisexual and I live with my mom. And I was afraid to tell her about my bisexuality, aAnd I was afraid to tell her as she always seemed quite judgemental about gay people in general. (If she is watching tv and sees a man with long hair, or a woman with short hair she complains about it. Or when she would hear a man talk in a slightly higher pitch voice she would immediately assume they're gay. So at 4:30 am (approx) today I told all my friends on Facebook (Including my mom,) that I was bi and she discovered it like 30 minutes ago. And when she did I got a phone call from her. It went something like this (J= me, M= my mom.)

M: J, delete this post.
J: Which one?
M:The one about being straight and gay. (I explained bisexual=straight & gay.)
J: What for?
M: Just delete it.
J: I don't want to.
M: DELETE IT NOW.
J: Give me a reason.
M: Delete it right now.

(Back and forth a few times)

M: When I come home I'm taking Facebook off of your phone.
 She puts down the phone.
So I eventually changed the Facebook post to say: My mum sucks and hates me so this post is unavailable :/ I tried calling her but she ignores it. 
I start to argue with her on messaging and i say things like: ""Oh okay, just ghost me like dad ghosted you."" And: ""Dad got you pregnant with me and then ghosted you..."" And things like that... So am I the asshole for arguing with her? (I know it escalated quite quickly but I think my mom has anger issues and I have Adhd and Autism. So I can sometimes rapidly escalate.) Also every time I try to grow my hair a bit longer than usual she'd say ""Do you want to look like a girl?""
BTW My mom was born in 1969 so that might be part the reason but I'm not sure. TL:DR I made a Facebook post about me being bisexual and my mom demanded I take it down. So I argued with her to defend my right. P.S  Yes, she is the type of woman who hangs live, laugh, love decorations all around the house. Obviously.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for suggesting my wife could breastfeed a friend’s baby,"Throwaway account: 
Background-
My wife (F 32) and I (M 31) agreed to babysit a friend’s (F 29) child (3 months) because she wanted/needed to go back to work. My wife is much better friends with this lady than I am but we have known her for several years, and she is a single mom so we are trying to help her out, thus we don’t charge her for the babysitting. We only babysit a few days per week because the friend’s work is hybrid, so she only goes in a couple of days per week. I work from home and my wife doesn’t work because she wants to be a full time mom to our kids. We have 2 children of our own a 3 year old and a 5 month old. 
Today-
Sally (name change) dropped her kid off a bit on the early side, normally she includes several bags of breast milk for feeding times. Today however she must have forgot about the breast milk, because none was in the bag. My wife called Sally to tell her that no milk was in the diaper bag. Sally said she really couldn’t turn around because she would be late and asked if I could go retrieve the milk from the refrigerator at her house. My wife agreed to this without asking me if I could fit this in to my morning schedule. So my wife gets off the phone and goes when her morning activities with the 3 small children. Fast forward about 2 hours, I’m in the middle of work and my wife pops into my office and asks me to run an errand to pick up the milk. I told her I couldn’t as I had a Monday morning conference call in a few minutes and I was still preparing last minute items. She got upset and some of her motherly instinct kicked in and a few sharp words soon followed. I am a problem solver by nature and I may have said something like you have 2 boobs so what is the problem, with that she left my office and went back to the kids. Once I got off my call I went down to the kitchen and asked my wife if she still needed the breast milk from Sally house. She said no and indicated that it was easier to just breast feed both of the babies, rather than breast feed one while trying to bottle feed the other. Fast forward to about 20 minutes ago Sally showed up to get her kid and my wife told her that we didn’t go to her house after all and she just breast fed Sally’s baby. Sally flipped out completely and accused us of hurting her child, threatened to call the cops and said my wife was a terrible person. I miss most of the fireworks because I was working in my office, but I caught the tail end of the conversation. My wife is now kinda blaming me because I couldn’t leave when the baby needed fed.  

Question: I am I the asshole for not going and getting the milk ? Also am I the asshole for suggesting that my wife had the ability to care for Sally’s baby without my help ? 

Please forgive any typos I’m on my phone while taking the my oldest kid on a walk. 

Edit: a few points of clarification, 1. My wife says she got distracted by other things and forgot to tell me until she went to get milk from the refrigerator, 2. My wife says she tried to call and text “Sally” but couldn’t get her on the phone all day. 3. My wife can’t really handle 3 little kids to go run that errand herself, especially when 2 of the kids were fussy and ready to be fed immediately. 4. Sally and my wife were pretty close, not quite bffs but they are well acquainted. 5. We don’t have formula in the house as we don’t use it.",Everyone Sucks

I asked my cousin a couple minutes ago if she would like to play a game called the past within, which requires 2 people. She rejected me immediately, and I asked her why she didn’t want to play and that she had suggested it a week or two ago. After I asked that, she slammed her hands on top of the chair and looked at me, sucking her lips in and tilting her head. I asked, ""Why did you do that? I was just asking why you didn’t want to play even though we talked about it previously."" She sighed, she looked at me, and she said, ""The thing is Zero already asked me to play, and then you asked me to play, so WHAT AM I SUPPOSE TO DO???"" And I replied with, ""How am I supposed to know that zero asked you to play too?"" And she says, ""YEAHHH but you were like, ""Why don’t you want to play with me even though you asked me a week ago to play with you?"" and plus, what if I just didn’t want to play?"" and I replied with, ""I didn’t know that your friend already asked, and if I had known, I wouldn’t have asked you too, and that instead of just saying no, you could have said you didn’t feel like playing with me or you could have said my friend already invited me."".

AITA For wearing my wedding dress to my sisters wedding?,"So, for the longest time my sister has been planning a 'red carpet' wedding, everyone is supposed to be dressed dramatically and we only had a few rules to abide by. The rules were really simple to follow, no ballgowns, no capes, no trains, there was NO rules on colours.

Her guest list for her wedding was basically identical to mine aside from her husbands friends because we have the same friend group, when we go out, we go out together, we've always been super close. This means when a lot of the girls were doing their dress shopping for the event my sister and I were helping them choose. They were going for prom dresses and cheap wedding dresses online, my sister did not have an issue with any of this. There were many pinks, reds, blues, silvers and whites! So to save money, I decided to use my wedding dress, which fit in with the dress code and add a white fluffy shawl and a broach. 

Anyway, day of the wedding everyone looks outstanding and my sister does really stand out, she looked like Cinderella and there was no mistaking anyone else for the bride. The entire wedding went amazing if only a few hiccups and nobody said anything to me about my attire. However, after the wedding my sister pulled me aside and told me how disappointed she was that I didn't make an effort for her big day like everyone else did. I argued that I pulled my weight and dressed according to the dress code, she wasn't upset that I wore a wedding dress, she was upset that I wore MY wedding dress. She said it shows that I'm lazy and uncreative and that it's embarrassing to her that I showed up  wearing a dress that had already been worn to another wedding attended by her guests. I guess I didn't see what the big deal is but she's really upset and brings it up now whenever I try to reach out to her. 

A few of my friends say I'm an AH for not just purchasing a different dress or apologizing and my husband says maybe I should have asked if it was okay to wear my wedding dress before I did so, instead of assuming that it was fine because other people were wearing wedding dresses. I personally don't think I have anything to be sorry about but I could be wrong.

i should note that my parents have a pretty rough marriage, & my sister had been wanting to take my mom on a trip to get away for a while now. i told my sister i couldn't go, because i have school/work related obligations i can't miss. my sister said that it was fine, because she could just take my mom, & i of course was sad that i couldn't go, but whatever, it'd be nice for them to have fun. however, i realized it was during the week of my birthday, so i asked if she could reschedule/not go so i wouldn't be alone on my bday. my sister got annoyed at me because she said that i didn't even want to celebrate my birthday & that we could just do something when she got back, & it wasn't her fault that her husband wanted to travel that week so she had to also go that week as well.

i never really celebrated my birthday bc i always thought i would do something nice for my 18th. however, after quarantine and spending so much time with my family, i realized i don't love birthday parties & i much prefer just getting to see all of my family & eating a nice meal on my birthday rather than something extravagant, which is why my sister said that.

my mom will go if my sister goes even though she doesn't really want to, just because she is too worried about my sister & her kids being alone. i technically am old enough to be without my mom, however, i really don't like being alone with my dad because he is emotionally abusive, bipolar, and narcissistic, & i have a lot of trauma from being alone with him.

i've been sort of asking/guilt-tripping my mom into not going so that she'll tell my sister to cancel the trip and not go, but i'm not really sure if i have the right to be doing that. my mom should be able to decide whether she wants to go regardless of how i feel, & it would kind of suck for my sister to not go when she really wants to. however, nothing has been finalized yet, so no money would be lost.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for no longer sending my daughter money,"My daughter lost her job during the pandemic and for the past 1.5 years or so, my ex husband and I have been supporting her, paying her rent, sending spending money, the works.

We’ve learned a harsh reality through this whole experience and that is that our daughter has no issue lying to us.

When we ask her about what jobs she’s applied to, she’s lied, in that she hasn’t applied to any.

The other major concern is that the money we send her seems to be all spent on food.


She’s had weight issues her whole life, in the past we’ve offered her the opportunity to work with trainers and nutritionists and she’s declined all of it. 

Things finally came to a head last weekend when we saw her for the first time since Christmas. She’s at her heaviest and was absolutely crammed into her outfit. 

Come to find out she’s 273 pounds. My ex was fed up and told her that she cannot continue to just let herself get bigger and bigger. I said that I would be pausing the money that I send her until I see 100% improvement, something my ex agreed to.

Our daughter thinks we’re AHs for doing something she views as drastic.

AITA for refusing to continue making vegan meals for my daughter?,"Throwaway

My (44 M) daughter (16 F) has recently gone vegan, due to her wanting to help out the earth more, and I've been extremely supportive. I promised to make her vegan meals alongside with my non-vegan meals. She was happy about that.

I'm a single dad, and I do all the cooking, cleaning, etc, and I get really tuckered out by the end of the day. Recently, work has been keeping me late with a bunch of new projects & documents, and by the time I get home, it's almost around the time you'd eat supper, and I'm about ready to sleep. And on top of having to make MY meal, I have to make a whole seperate meal just for my daughter.

However, I would push through even if I was tired. After about 2 weeks of it, though I decided my daughter's vegan diet was most likely a phase, as I've seen multiple people go through this vegan/vegetarian thing. I decided it was not worth breaking my back over, when it would be so much easier to just make one meal for us both.

I immediately let her know, and I told her my reasoning, and that in a few months, she'd probably not even remember the time when she had wanted to go vegan, and I just honestly couldn't keep putting myself through extra labor. She called me AH straight away, and told me I was ignorant to her feelings and her diet was not my choice. I understand that, but I don't feel her ""diet"" should make me have more work to do.

I finally told her I was not going to change my mind, and she could either eat the meal I made, or she could go buy her food herself. She continued to call me a huge AH.

So, AITA?

Edit: Thank you guys for the comments and the feedback. I realize I may have gone too far by telling her the diet was a phase. I read over the comments saying she should already know how to cook, and I agree, but she has never decided to learn. I'll have another talk with her, apologise, and set some new rules in place.

AITA for not wanting to have my photos taken,"I don’t like taking photos of myself. I view myself as an extremely unphotogenic person and I’m extremely self conscious of my body. However I’m on a trip with my mom and she loves taking photos of me. 

I’ve told her multiple times I’m not comfortable with it but she says I’m disrespecting her and that she gave birth to me so what’s the problem with her taking my photos. She also said that my trip is a once in a lifetime experience and that I should commemorate with photos of myself. 

I was on a gondola with her and I told her that I didn’t want to take a photo with her and she started saying how I was being unappreciative and rude. She then proceeded to “sneakily” take selfies of herself with me included. I cannot tell her I hate it because I think she’ll throw a fit.

AITA for snapping at my girlfriend after she told me to toughen up,"I have chronic migraines and its something I've dealt with my whole life. I've had to constantly work to prevent them. It sucks. I used to think that my girlfriend of 6 months was sympathetic to my issue, but, after this past weekend, I'm not sure. We were just hanging out, and then a headache hit, so, I'm down for the count and my vision is shot for the time being. She gets off the couch and decides to grab a snack.

&#x200B;

After a few minutes of complete silence, almost as if I'm bothering her, she tells me to just "" toughen up and power through it"", so that we could get back to our night. I was pretty pissed off by that comment and told her that I don't need medical advice from someone whose doctor just told her at an appointment that she's obese. 

She thought it was a low blow. I told her I thought her telling me to toughen up was a low blow and added that, maybe instead of snapping at me, she could've helped me get rid of the pain. She's now trying to, amongst her friends, make me out to be a fat shamer. This type of fighting isn't us and I want us to get back to normal.

AITA for not offering to pay for my roommates broken skincare bottle?,"So for context, he’s my friend of many years. I know him super well, and though he means a well… he has a habit of being pretty careless when it comes to leaving things around.

I don’t really mind. I’m not super neat. I can be a little cluttered at times but I’m generally good at making sure I keep things fairly clean and hygienic. 

Him, not so much. He gets these fixations where he wants certain things to be super pristine and done a certain way. But then also does things that are pretty egregious, like leaves puke bowls in the sink.

Or leaving his cuticle nippers in the middle of the carpet hidden by the fibers that I end up stepping and cutting myself on. 

I think the worst thing he ever left around was a used douche on the kitchen table. I sat down to eat breakfast and was a few bites in when I realized what it was. That was a little shocking.

I generally don’t get mad at him. I’m not an explosive or angry person when it comes to close people in my life. I usually just let him know in a light hearted way about these things and keep it pushing.

However, he doesn’t really show me the same patience.

The most recent example:

I came home from a long work day and went to use the bathroom. I flush, and went to go wash my hands, when I see that his like 10 step skincare routine bottles and lotions are literring our tiny bathroom counter. 

I go to wash my hands and my elbow brushes against some little serum bottle that was sitting precariously at the edge of the counter. It falls and breaks.

I clean it up, and walk into the living room  afterwards to let him know what happened. I apologize for the accident. 

He like “oh okay,” and I think we’re good. 

That is until later, when he comes to me very somberly and tells me he feels like I don’t respect his stuff because I didn’t offer to pay to replace this expensive skincare serum. 

Some other background. He’s a trust fund baby. I work minimum wage jobs and am self-supporting.

This skincare bottle was $70. That’s like a days pay for me. 

I explained to him that I felt like he left it in a really precarious place, and I was just trying to use the sink. To prevent the accident, I would have had to stop, grab everything with my unwashed hands, and then play Jenga to fit it all into our tiny medicine cabinet, which I feel was unreasonable to expect. 

I also didn’t know it was glass. I thought it was plastic and therefore was not aware all that stuff was at such high risk for breaking if it fell/got bumped. 

He made me feel really bad, insisted I was being careless/disrespectful. So I apologized for misjudging the risk of washing my hands there without moving the stuff, and offered to pay for part of the cost of replacing it. 

But thinking more, I feel like if he cared so much about his stuff, maybe don’t leave it around everywhere where it can easily be broken or trampled? Idk I’m a little salty now, but lmk what you guys think.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for calling the police on my roommate’s boyfriend who was banging on the door in the middle of the night?,"A week ago, my (20F) roommate (20F) tried to get me and two of my friends arrested. 

The three of us were sitting on my dorm room bed, me with my two friends (20M) and (21F). The one who is of age had bought a bottle of wine, and the three of us were drinking it and watching a movie.

My roommate called campus police on us and said she was going to get us all arrested and get my friend who was drinking underage kicked out of the military. He enlisted two years ago when he turned 18. This didn’t happen, though that was her goal.

The other night, her boyfriend was banging on our door in the middle of the night asking for his watch or something. My roommate wasn’t home. I called campus police and reported that a strange man was banging on my door aggressively.

My roommate screamed at me about it when she got home. She said “what the fuck is wrong with you that you’d call the police” and I said “because I don’t like you.” She followed me around, and I locked her out of my room so she can’t come in through the common room.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for inviting only one daughter-in-law on a vacation AND planning the vacation at all?,"I (F, 58) have two boys, Mikey (32) and Jesse (29). Mikey is married to a lovely lady, Fiona. I was really excited when they got married five 5 years ago because I never had a daughter (miscarried). Fiona didn't really seem to reciprocate the feeling because she's always been firmly distant with me. Mikey once told me ""she's not really a people's person."" Fiona's actually even been a little rude/snappish with me at times when I've dropped by their house without calling and insists that every encounter with her be very planned.

Three years ago Jesse got married to Ava, and Ava is amazing. She and I became close even though she and Jesse live 7 hours away, while Mikey and Fiona only live \~35 minutes away. 20 months ago they had my first grandchild, Ryan, who is my angel. Jesse's line of work makes decent money, but he has to work a lot, so Ava has been stuck with the majority of the child raising. I try to stay over there for a few days to help take care of Ryan, so I know firsthand how exhausted Ava gets raising Ryan and doing housework. 4 months ago I decided to plan a surprise vacation with Ava. I asked her to discuss with Jesse taking 2 weeks off work for late August so she and I could go to California and have some fun. According to her, Jesse took the time off thinking it was for a family vacation, but when she clarified that only she was going, he got upset.

Jesse called me annoyed saying that he didn't want to be left alone with Ryan. I pointed out that Ava is left alone taking care of Ryan pretty much constantly and he will have to suck it up and have father/son time. He said it was selfish for me to take his wife away from his son who is young and will be ""deeply affected by even two weeks without her."" I told him he was behaving like a kid and the conversation ended without resolution. Jesse then called and told Mikey, who called me later saying he thinks Ava should go on the trip, but asking why I didn't invite Fiona. I was surprised because Fiona always made me feel that the less I am in her life=the better, so I told Mikey this. He sounded really hurt and said that was unfair and that Fiona is probably suffering from undiagnosed anxiety too. I apologized to him, but he said Fiona already knew she wasn't invited and felt left out. I was going to rectify it by extending an invitation to her, but Ava told me about a week later that we should just reschedule the trip for next year when Ryan is older.

I feel that Jesse was being immature and I'm actually concerned about him as a father/husband as I felt his behavior towards Ava was manipulative. On the plus side, he's bringing the whole family up to see me for a week during his time off. But the Fiona situation has made me wonder if I should have involved her.

Edit:  ""I would like to point out however that Fiona and I's relationship is not solely because she doesn't like me dropping by--please don't misinterpret what I've said. She has always shied away from speaking to me, doesn't respond to texts/calls, etc, and has been curt. Mikey and I have spoken about it and he's told me she's just like that and, recently, he thinks she has anxiety issues."" Just so everyone knows it's not solely about the dropping by issue, which has now been resolved by me not doing that.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for not watching little sister?,"Hey, so I’m 26M and my sister is 19F. She’s very autistic, like hand flaps, drooling, only talks about baby things like princesses, etc. Truth be told, I don’t enjoy being around her. Sometimes my parents ask me to watch her, but I’ll say no because of this (though I tell my parents it’s because of work because I don’t want to come off an ass.) I knew that I was having today as an off day so I couldn’t wait to stay at home and just let loose, watch movies, maybe smoke a little weed.

Earlier in the week my mom called and asked me if I could watch my sister today, I said no. Yesterday they called again to which I said no again because I want to relax on my day off like any guy. I don’t think it’s bad to not want to have something to do.

This morning I got a text from mom saying she’d be back about 4:30. I thought it was for my dad or something since she hadn’t been to my house in the first place to come back to. I called dad and he said he was at work so that confused me. I looked out the window for mom’s car or something and it turns out she left my sister on the porch. I called mom and pointed this out to her, she said “oh yeah, it won’t be for long.” It was about 11 so 4:30 was easily five hours. I said I wasn’t looking after her so someone better come get her. I kept my word and didn't have her in my house at all.

Well eventually my mom showed up at my house and banged on the door, chewed me out with some “how could you” speech about not looking after the sister I said I wasn’t watching. I got another earful when they went home because I guess sister defecated in her pants during the time she was on my porch, which sucks but I didn’t cause this.

I’ve never seen mom that upset and it has me wondering if I was the asshole for not watching my sister when my mom presented me with her. I just wanted to enjoy my time but I wonder if I did wrong.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for wanting to keep my daughters name the same?,"My boyfriend 30 (M) and I 21 (F) are pregnant with a girl and since before I was pregnant my boyfriend has been saying that his daughters name is going to be Lily. From the beginning of the pregnancy we agreed if it was a girl he would name it and if it was a boy I would name it. I wasn’t super fond of the name Lily but since I’ve become pregnant and found out it was a girl, I’ve been calling her Lily and grown attached to it. Until about a week ago when my boyfriend said he wanted to change her name to Milly. I absolutely dislike that name and want to keep her name the same because I love the name Lily now. I told him this is how I feel and he said it’s not fair because he gets to pick the name, and I told him it’s not fair to change her name so last minute (for context I’m 6 months along). He also said he’s compromised on every other thing about her name like hyphenating her last name and I picked the middle names. It started an argument and in the end I told him the hospital will ask me what her name is and I will put Lily on her birth certificate and he can sign it or not, now he’s pretty upset with me. And I understand why, but I still want to keep her name and I think he doesn’t realize that it’s still the name he picked I’m just refusing to change it. AITA for not letting him change the name?

Edit: for everyone saying “this shows how our parenting will be like”, this hasn’t affected our relationship at all we agreed that arguments should remain arguments and we’ve gone about our loving relationship as usual. We both know eventually we will have to agree on a name but will work that out in our own time. We don’t like to sit on anger for long rather just let it go and wait til we come back to it. But I don’t think is disagreeing on a name means we won’t be able to parent our child, I personally feel like it’s a very insignificant argument and I’ll love my child no matter their name.

Edit 2: also for everyone saying throw out both names and pick a new one, I love that idea but unfortunately my boyfriend would not be open to that idea which is why it’s kinda between the 2 names because they’re both names he picked one is just the name he had picked since before I was pregnant and agreed upon and the other is what he wants to change it to. I don’t have any girl specific names in mind that are special to me, and since the beginning of our relationship he has said Lily is an important name to him.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for telling my manager that she’s wasting her life in a fast food joint?,"For context, my and my manager are pretty close friends. We both work mornings and occasionally we’ll jokingly talk shit to each other to pass the time. 

Well, we were roasting each other this morning and my manager told me that I’m the main reason my parents got divorced. Their divorce was pretty awful to go through and I’m still seeing a therapist about it years later (which she doesn’t know). I was genuinely hurt when she said that and it triggered some pretty traumatic childhood memories in my mind even though I know she meant it as a joke. I responded by telling her she’s wasting her life in a fast food joint because she’s been working here for 20 years and hates when people insult her career choice. I’ll admit there was an extra layer of venom in my response because I was pretty upset about her divorce comment and wasn’t thinking straight. 

I know our friendship will be fine but did I cross the line with my response? I’m still mildly upset at her original comment hours later. That’s how deep the childhood trauma goes for me. I could use an outside perspective on this.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for not having sympathy for my husband hating his job?,"I am a stay at home mom who does it all, no, quite literally I do absolutely everything around here. He does not lift a finger when he’s home. I serve him breakfast, lunch and dinner, and am the sole care taker for our 3 kids, ages 9, 2 and 6months (and by sole I mean he will play with our 2 year old on average a combined total of 30 mins per day, and then a quick hello, hug and chat with the other 2. I love staying at home, it is my dream, I am happy to do it, I adore my kids and I enjoy serving my husband. 

Now the problem comes with my husband and his job (well he quit at this point and is now jobless, we have no income). He was paid well considering his lack of degree ($75,000) received bonuses, regular small incentives like gift cards, and participated in team building monthly; fun activities like golf, arcades, ax throwing, etc. and meals paid for. At first he loved it, it was great, even saw himself with the company for life  but with the housing market the way it is, things got tough. This season of his job got stressful and difficult, he complained endlessly about things he couldn’t control, and that he wasn’t being paid enough and is under appreciated. He’s making more money than he ever has, is constantly recognized for his hard work and regularly rewarded for that work by way of bonuses, gift cards and even gifts from his clients on top of that. I understand it’s stressful and sucks but I feel like his company recognized this season of difficulty following Covid and was generously compensating their employees. Just in the last 3 months he received 2 raises amounting to more than $5 per hour combined. That’s more than most people receive in years! The problems sounded minuscule compared to what he’s delt with in the past, and his compensation sounded fantastic, a dream even! No one LIKES going to work everyday, work is work, but it has to get done, at least be thankful you are appreciated and compensated generously.

Instead of sticking through it, he quit without having another job. He’d been job searching for weeks and found nothing, and quit anyways. He’s been home for a week and doesn’t want to even look for a job because he’s “taking his vacation”. People are getting laid off across the country and he just quit. In my mind, everyday the clock is ticking, opportunities are being missed, things are getting more expensive and more companies are laying people off rather than hiring. 

I’m having a hard time having sympathy because 1. His job seemed fantastic, the best he’s ever had and 2. I’m still holding up my end of the bargain here at home with zero help while he is on “vacation”.

AITA for missing two work deadlines?,"I apologise in advance for the long read but I had to give some context.
I (18f) am a content writer and I began writing early this year. when I first started, I didn't really have a client base but I had a friend (21m) who did. He'd give me work from some of his clients and that's how we basically started working together. He'd get work from his clients and send over to me. Here's the real problem; he has never paid me on time and I mean never. He would also miss some payments completely and I would let it go because we've been friends for a while. I can't remember a time where he paid me without me asking him about it for weeks. He'd always complain about the client paying late or the fees of the app he uses. 
I gradually reduced the workload i got from him and built my own client base but there's this website I love writing for and continued to take jobs from him just for this particular website even though the pay was really low. He still pays late and sometimes doesn't make the complete payment but I continued writing for him because of this website and the fact that we've been friends for three years. Last month, the client sent more topics from this website and I told him to give the work to another writer as I was sick and I knew he was going to delay my payment again. He pleaded and promised he would pay immediately and I decided to trust him and write even as I was recovering. That was really stupid on my part but we've been friends for a while and I decided to just do it. He delayed payments again for almost a month. I was really angry and I told him I would never write for him again without getting my payment beforehand. He agreed. 
This month, the client sent in more topics to write on and he contacted me again. I asked for my down payment but he begged and promised that he would pay on time. He called a couple of our friends to beg me too and I agreed to write just because the calls were getting too much. To be honest, I've lost all motivation to write even for this website and I failed to turn in the work twice this week. He has been texting me, calling me an asshole and saying it wouldn't be nice for us to lose this client after a long time of working with him and I know that but I'm just so tired of working without assured pay.

AITA for leaving my nephew with my partners?,"Throwaway because my brother is definitely on reddit and i think he follows my real account

I am a man in a serious polyamorous relationship with two partners who live with me, I've been in a relationship with one ill call Sarah for 5 years, and another ill call Mia for 3 years. i have two brother but only one is important to this story who ill call Frank. Frank was pretty against me being in this relationship when Mia entered it, he called it weird and exploitative and immoral. he would make little jokes and quips about it to me until one day i got sick of it and sat him down and basically laid down the law about it. told him that Sarah and Mia are the loves of my life and we work so well together and I'm truly happy being with them and if he cant respect that and accept me AND my partners, I wouldn't be speaking to him anymore as his disrespect is actively hurting me and my family.

Frank was resistant at first in the conversation but as we went on he softened up and told me he was just worried about me, but he would do his best to accept me and change his behavior

Frank asks me to babysit my nephew Gumby (who is 4) every once in a while and I'm more than happy to because i love Gumby and so do my partners. Frank dropped off Gumby the other day and we were playing mario party with Sarah while Mia was upstairs doing some work. We finished the game and i had to go do some grocery shopping so i asked gumby if he wanted to come with me and he said ""No i wanna stay here with aunt Sarah!"" i asked Sarah if she was okay watching him on her own and she said ""yeah sure"". i had never left Gumby with just my partners before but i didn't really think anything of it so i popped upstairs, told Mia what's going on and went to get the groceries. came home and we played some more mario party until Frank came to get him. then a few hours later i get an angry phone call from Frank asking me why i abandoned my nephew with my ""fuck buddies"". i was pretty shocked and asked him what he meant, he said that he was asking Gumby what he did at my house over dinner and Gumby told him that i left to go get groceries and left him with Sarah. i said ""yeah. i did that. so what?"" and Frank went off on me about how he left Gumby to be babysat by ME. not anyone else. especially by ""some strange women i hang around with"" and i got really angry at that and started yelling at him, he was yelling at me. until he ended the call with ""you're never seeing Gumby again. you're lucky i dont call the fucking cops on you for leaving my son in a dangerous situation like this"" and he hung up.

so i don't know. i figured i would ask here. should i have been more careful? am i the asshole for this?

TL;DR: i left my nephew with my partners for an hour or so to go get groceries and my brother blew up at me for it because he doesn't accept my relationship as much as i thought he did

&#x200B;

EDIT:  the rough timeline of Franks jokes/rudeness is that Sarah and i got together. we dated exclusively for about 3 months and she expressed interest in polyamory and i was open to it. so we started bringing other people into the relationship casually. then Sarah reconnected to her old classmate and crush Mia. Mia was casually invited into the relationship and things were so good we kept wanting to see her until we all had a talk and became an official couple and moved in together soon after. i started bringing both Sarah and Mia to family parties and get togethers and that's when Frank started ramping up the hostility and jokes. before that it was just playful jokes here and there that i didn't care about. but this was openly hostile. so after the second family party it happened at was when we had that talk and Frank seemed to genuinely apologize to me, Sarah, and Mia and made an effort to accept me and get to know them at least casually. so we thought he had changed and accepted us or at least began to make an effort to almost three years ago. maybe 2 and a half at the very least.

EDIT 2: alright. the official judgement is that everyone sucks. thank you all for your judgements and advice. i've decided that I'm going to call Frank and apologize for not giving him a heads up that i was running to the store and leaving Gumby with Sarah and Mia. it would have been good to do that regardless of his feelings about my relationship. a quick text giving him a heads up. that's all. But im also going to let him know that what he said on that phone call was deeply hurtful to my partners and i. even if it came from a place of parental panic or anger. he still said what he said and its clear those thoughts and feelings were in him already and he used them to try to hurt me. So im going to ask him not to bring Gumby by for a while to babysit because he clearly doesnt trust or respect my partners and i. and i cant allow that into my home even if i love Gumby so much and want to spend time with him. we can talk about it and try to move past this. but hes lost a great deal of trust, respect and progress in accepting me and my partners and he is going to have to work very hard if he wants a relationship with me again. and if he cant accept that, im going little to no contact.

AITA for getting upset in my group chat?,"I feel silly even asking this but here I am. 

I f(25) have a group chat with some friends, we'll call them Nancy (M28) and Bob (M30). I recently got a new phone, a Samsung. They both have iPhones. I sent a tiktok I had found that compared the quality of both phone cameras side by side and then I said I had picked this phone because I liked the camera quality (the winner in the vid is the phone that i bought). I think it's important to note I didn't say anything negative about the iPhone besides sending the toktok.

They proceeded to message back and forth debating the differences of the camera quality which then devolved into them talking about all the negative things they don't like about samsungs while praising the iPhones. I was not participating in this, I haven't had an iPhone in like 10 years so it didn't seem like a fair thing for me to argue. I just made a comment saying ""just let me enjoy my new phone, jeez."" Because I was feeling a little upset at the bashing on the phone I just dropped hella coin on. 

They responded with things like ""dang I thought this was a safe space"" and so I said it is a safe space but i also explained I just felt like this convo was very one sided as was making me feel like I can't enjoy my new phone and that they were just saying all the ways they thing Samsung sucks. I did also apologize for making them feel like it wasn't a safe space. Bob bowed out but Nancy told me not to put words in his mouth and now he muted the convo for the whole weekend and won't talk to us until next week and now I feel like that was all my fault and I feel like shit for it.

AITA for not saying where I got my clothes from?,"I (20F) really love to dress up, look nice, and put together, all that stuff. I also have a petite body frame and do cardio frequently so I am very fit, which makes my clothes look flattering on me. Earlier this week, I was going to lecture to meet up with friends and they complimented my outfit. We were sitting down and Tracy (19F) said “Your outfit is so cute! Where did you get the pink top from?” Normally if it was makeup or something I would say where I got it but the thing is, I want my style to be unique and I don’t want to twin with anyone accidentally. I declined telling her and told her I could help her find something similar at a different store. Tracy looked at me with a stink eye and turned to another friend. 

When I got home, my phone was blowing up from my friend group telling me I was a bitch for “gate keeping” my clothes and that I should’ve just told Tracy. However, I have some friends who sided with me and said I have the right to want to be unique and have my own style. AITA?",Everyone Sucks
AITA for taking an insult too personally?,"I (16m) go to a school that's still online after COVID, and I won't bludge; it's a school for the bright. We have a lot of kids with disorders: ADHD, OCD and GAD are the most common. I myself have severe ADHD and OCD. I've disclosed it to the school administration, I had a heart-to-heart with the schools counselor and they were understanding; as far as I know, this is the experience other students have.

I'm currently taking Calculus I as a course, and I volunteered to help teach in Geometry, a course that 8th and 9th graders usually take. I've done it for a semester now and I haven't run into any problems. That was until one fateful day in August.

At the start of the year we had 5 new students in class. The teacher I'm helping got everyone to introduce themselves, and it was all going merry until it got to a certain student's turn, let's call her Grace. Grace introduces herself, goes through the icebreaker questions, then finished by saying ""I also have ADHD and OCD so please be understanding."" I just say ""of course"" and move on.

First thing that starts to bother me is how Grace will be on her phone (visibly) during class. The teacher I'm working with told her not to, and she blamed it on her ADHD, saying it was a tic. Next was her tendency to shout out the answer to questions on the board. Even when we make clear that it is for a student to come on mic and solve step-by-step, she shouts out the answer immediately. I told her to refrain from giving the answer every time, and she said ""ADHD"". She was calling back to her disorders in the text chat, nearly every comment would somehow be pivoted to her.

The straw that broke the camel's back was close to the end of the class, when I was on camera (normally it's just the teacher, but she asked me to solve a problem on the board and explain how it's done). She interrupts me on mic and tells me ""Can you fix the painting on your wall behind you, it's crooked and I have OCD."" I said ""no"" rather defiantly, and she said ""Normal people just don't understand."" Now this got me. I have gone through years of therapy, have put in so much effort to get my OCD from destroying my life to something I can live with, and I just exploded at her. I said ""We all know you're faking. Stop it, get off mic, and go get some help for your Munchausen's.""

She went off mic, and after the class I got an email from my teacher reprimanding me. I got an email from her parents, telling me I was minimizing their daughters issues. I emailed back apologizing, and through sucking up, I got to keep my volunteering role. I don't feel that I've done anything wrong.

So here's my question. From my view, I shouted at an illness faker after she openly insulted me. From another view, I shouted at someone with disorders and feel no remorse. I need help with this Reddit, AITA?",Everyone Sucks
AITA for yelling at my girlfriend for throwing out my favourite pillow?,"Throwaway account since she uses Reddit. 

So me (24M) and my girlfriend (23F) have been living together for almost 2 years. When we first moved out she bought us a brand new bed and bed frame because ours were both old. She also got us all this new expensive bedding which I admit is nice, but a little ridiculous she spent almost $700 on sheets, pillows and a duvet and stuff like that from a bedding store when you can get ones from Costco or Amazon for pretty cheap. But whatever it’s her money. Anyways, she bought us each 2 new pillows and I do use the memory foam one but I wanted to keep one of my old pillows from my parents place because it’s I really like it. My mom gave it to me when I was 10 and she had it in her bed for about 5 years before that. 

Now to the issue: 

My girlfriend is really particular about the bed, she always has been. She likes it very clean and made a specific way every day. She changes the sheets twice a week and is always washing the mattress cover to make sure it’s as clean as can be. She also never lets either of us get into bed without a shower. I understand that though since I work in trades and get pretty dirty. So needless to say she thought my pillow was kind of gross. She likes to replace her pillows every few years and she can’t believe I have this pillow that’s 19 years old. She put up with it for a while but I came home from work on Friday and when I went to go to bed I noticed the pillow she got for me 2 years ago that I never opened was now on the bed in place of my old pillow. When I asked her about it she told me she got rid of it because she couldn’t handle sleeping next to my dirty pillow any more. I thought this was ridiculous and proceeded to yell at her for being childish. I do feel bad for yelling but I’m really upset she just threw away my pillow. I really don’t see the issue with my old pillow.

So AITA?

Edit: grammar

EDIT 2: I also want to say this item wasn’t sentimental to me or anything, my mother is still alive and well and I didn’t really tie the pillow to her in any way. It was just a comfortable pillow that I really liked and I haven’t been able to find anywhere that sells a pillow that has the same feel to it. Regardless of that though it was something I liked and I do t think it was right for her I just throw it away. I could have used it somewhere else…

Edit 3: for those of you wondering, the pillow is not down, it’s some kind of fibre…. Not sure what kind

Edit 4: so the comment section seems pretty torn about who is right or how we both suck. I still wasn’t sure what to do so I called my mom late last night and she reamed me out for owning a pillow that was so old. She’s backing up my girlfriend, I guess she feels the same way about pillows. She was under the impression I had gotten rid of it years ago when she got me new pillows to replace my old ones when I was 13. Here I thought I was just getting extra pillows all these years. She was pretty dumbfounded I still had this pillow and told me I shouldn’t have yelled at her or even made a big deal about any of this at all because my girlfriend is right. Even my mother knows how my girlfriend is about the bed since she noticed how clean my bed started to be when I started bringing my girlfriend around my parents house, and my mother noticed pretty quickly. She asked me why I care so much and I didn’t really have an answer other than “I liked it”. She, and the other YTA comments made me realize I was probably more in the wrong then my girlfriend. 

I can see now how she put up with it for an extended amount of time and I shouldn’t have been so stubborn. There was no real reason I wanted to keep this pillow. She would never throw away anything of mine with sentimental value, and I certainly wouldn’t compare this old pillow to my old favourite childhood stuffy I still have and very much treasure. There are reasons I’m not going to get into as to why she’s so particular and OCD about the bed. It doesn’t really extend to other areas of the house. She likes it clean obviously, but she’s not that particular about anything else but the bed so I don’t really think that calls for therapy or a professional. She’s made a lot of compromises for me so I can do this for her.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for telling my brother he always ruins everything?,"So I (16f) have 5 brother (21, 20, 18, 14 and 11). I’m unfortunately the only girl in the house. though I have a great relationship with my older brothers they’re the best big brother ever and I love them so much. I also have a great relationship with my younger brother(14). He’s such an angel, he has literally fallen out of heaven into our family. I love him so so much. We do everything together and we are inseparable. 
My other younger brother(11) and the rest of my siblings don’t get along with him. I can’t say how the rest feel about him. I tend to avoid him. He’s annoying, he’s destructive, in general awful to be around. 
My dad is the most amazing dad ever I love him so much. He’s calls me the princess of the house and we love shopping together. It kinda suck I don’t see him often because of his work.
My mom is great. She is really strict with everyone except younger Bro(11). 


I’m a perfume fanatic. I have like 30 perfumes, I recently received Lost cherry by Tom ford as a gift from my dad. It has become my favorite perfume. The scent is so delicious I love it.

Three days ago my brothers 14, 20 and I decided to go to an arcade. My younger brother was at his soccer practice so we couldn’t ask him to go and other brothers had to do other things. We arrived home, I went upstairs to see the door of my room open. I found my favorite perfume on the ground in pieces. I asked him(11) if he did it. He didn’t want to admit it at first but after repeated questioning he ended up admitting to it. I ask him why he felt the need to destroy something I love, why he always had to ruin everything and make our daily lives so much harder. I told my older brothers(21, 20,18) and they scolded him and ask him why he can’t respect our stuff. Mom heard the commotion and immediately took his side as usual. He told my mom some non sense story about how he was just trying to spray my perfume so he could feel closer to me because he feels left out he dropped it by accident he didn’t mean to blah blah. Excuses he knows better than to touch my perfumes. I made it clear that if they ever broke one of my perfumes there would never be a peaceful day in this house ever again.

We all had to apologize to my brother and are now forced to take him to the arcade and hangout with him. My dads pissed that mom took my brothers side since the perfume he broke was $500. Everyone is having a bad time now because of him
Mom is of course angry with me the most told me it was out of line what I said. I strongly disagree with her it was bound to happen if it wasn’t me it would’ve been my older brothers. She coddles him too much that why he’s like this. My brothers agree with my dad agrees with me she’s the only one that is telling me that I’m in the wrong. Am I the asshole?",Everyone Sucks
AITA for yelling at my neighbor about leashing our dogs?,"Context: I have 2 dogs. A 35lb shepard mix, and a 140lb great dane. The shepard loves people and dogs and is super friendly. She is voice trained and listens very well. Dane is skiddish around people and HATES other dogs

I work early in the morning. I'm up at 5:00 to pack lunch and take the dogs out to poop. We don't have a yard, so I walk them around our neighborhood. Everyone here has dogs, but im the first one awake in the neighborhood everyday. For 8 months I have been doing this and haven't seen another person this early.

The issue: doing the normal routine, put the harnesses on the dogs, leash them up, grab the poop bags and start our walk. We can go one of two ways out our front door. Right; to a small designated dog area, or left; to a larger designated dog area with some woods and a creek. We go left and all is good. Shepard smells something in the woods and darts off to check it out. Dane follows. I give them a lil tug to get them back on track. Shepard follows, dane doesn't. He lunges into the woods and snaps the leash. I fall on my ass and he sprints into the woods. I tell my shepard to go get him, unleash her, and follow them both. She turns him around and herds him back to me. I grab his harness and now he's not going anywhere. 

As we are leaving the woods, we come out to see a guy with his little dog off leash walking maybe 50 yards away from us.  Little dog comes running our way. Shepard immediately takes off to go say hi. Dane IMMEDIATLEY wants to eat that dog.

I'm having to dig my heels into the ground to hold back the dane. He is barking, pulling, and snarling at this other dog. Making it very clear he is not friendly

Me: hey sorry the big guys leash broke a little bit ago could you grab your dog?

Him: why isn't your other dog on a leash?

Me: why isn't YOUR dog on a leash??

Him: she doesn't need a leash

Me: OBVIOUSLY SHE FUCKING DOES

him: (referencing the shepard) call this dog back I don't want it hurting my dog

Me: PICK UP YOUR DOG AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE THEN

Him: why should I? Just because you can't handle your dogs?

Me (in a panic):YES. YOU CAN LEAVE, OR I CAN LET GO

He stared at me for a little bit and watched me fight my dog. he then picked up his dog LEASH IN HAND and walked up to the other dog spot. 

My shepard escorted them halfway up then i called her back. Once they were out of sight, dane calmed down and shepard came prancing back like she made a friend. Put shepard back on her leash, holding dane by the harness, we calmly walked back inside. 

I will admit fault for the big, poorly trained dog. I'm doing my best to fix his behavior. He has been on a short leash his entire life, and I go out of my way to avoid situations like these. But AITA neighbor with big bad dog and a loud mouth?

AITA for complaining about my roomates?,"AITA for getting frustrated at 2 of my roommates for not cleaning up after themselves or their dog and turning the AC and heat on without warning?

 I (F23) live with 4 other girls (all F22-24) and for the most part we get along well. Two of the roommates are a couple and have a dog. My main complaints against them come from them not cleaning up their mess or their dog’s. For example, a few nights ago they cooked dinner together and tried to clean but left smears all along the counters almost as if they tried to clean but just ended up smearing the grease everywhere. There were also a lot of crumbs and dirt on the floor to the point where it was uncomfortable to walk barefoot in the house. The next morning I decided to actually clean the kitchen and sweep because I personally couldn’t handle the mess anymore. When they came downstairs I confronted them and said something along the lines of “hey would you guys mind cleaning up after you make dinner together? the counters and the floor were both dirty.” And I was met with “oh we swept and mopped yesterday.” I then showed her the pile of dirt and dog fur that I dumped in the trash and her response was “Oh I dont know how that got there. The air vents must blow around the dog fur because we cleaned last night” Obviously I can’t tell them they didn’t clean when they believe that they’ve swept and mopped. It’s also important to note that we haven’t had the air on for at least a week before this because the temperature dropped to a comfortable degrees.

A second example is something that has been ongoing since we’ve moved into this house. We moved in Sep 1st so the weather at this time was around 70-80. They would constantly turn on the AC without telling any of the other roommates and we would all have our windows open to get the breeze into the house. They’ve been told multiple times to let everyone know in the group chat when they were going to turn the air on because that’s a waste of energy. Still its almost as if they refuse to tell us. This morning I was cooking and had the windows and the back door cracked to get the smell of sausage out of the house (the temperature outside right now is 60) I didnt notice until I used the closed bathroom that the heat was on and it was literally just getting sucked out of all of the downstairs windows without notice. 

There’s honestly a lot more instances that have happened since we moved in but there were the two most recent.

AITA for treating my sister the same way she treats everyone else?,"My sister(18F) and I (20F) have a somewhat strained relationships. Definitely not as bad as it use to be but we occasionally get into  screaming matches. Some context before today’s incident , my sister to sum it up … is a bitch. It’s kinda an unspoken thing about her among the family. My sister has always gotten her way and is very self centered . If it’s not her way it’s the highway, theres so many incidents of this where trips have been alternated or ruined because of her constant bad mood. Well I am the more passive sister, I don’t like conflict and I know to prevent that I just have to keep quiet, which I guess comes off as a pushover. My sister had recently bought 3 pairs of jeans totaling to 78 dollars ( I think). I was cleaning up  yesterday when I threw the receipts away since it was left out. Today she immediately flipped out on me asking where it was and I told her in the trash bin and she looks in it while yelling at me as if I knew what the receipt was for and to not touch her stuff. I didn’t know what the receipt was for and we usually throw all loose paper away. She ends up finding it in the garbage but this starts another argument on how she needs to keep her stuff safe and put it away because I don’t like it out. She then flips out again, so I snapped and all the built up anger and mistreatment from her released and I started saying things like I don’t care , stop talking to me and etc. and straight up ignoring and speaking over her. Then she slipped out to get a reaction from me that she looked through my phone and saw me venting about her to my friends. And that I was the bitch and etc. This hit a nerve that she invaded my privacy and had gone snooping through my phone.

AITA drunk Uber mess - venmo/e transfer after making me rate him 5 stars,"First, let me (20F) start by saying I did not think I was gonna puke. Once we got closer to my house I proceeded to puke out the Uber’s car window. I was by myself. I was visibly drunk and apologized profusely. I offered to tip him $15 on the $12 ride. Once we stopped at my place he got out and proceeded to yell at me and call me names saying I wasted his time. I apologized so much and all he needed was a car wash. Nothing got inside. He saw my wallet with $100 cash and demanded I give it to him. I said no, he then demanded I e transfer (venmo for American folks) him $40. Im just trying to go in my house at this point so I agreed. He said I’m lucky since Uber would charge me $200. I put in his email and I’m again apologizing and it doesn’t work. He starts yelling at me saying I’m a scammer and I told him I was doing my best as I’m drunk and stumbling. He puts in his email himself and it’s still not working and continues to yell at me. Once it started working, he then demanded $50 instead of $40, so I did e transfer him $50, along with giving him the $15 tip. He told me to leave when I was already out the car and e transferred him. At this point I’m sick of it and I tell him he needs to get off my property and drive away.

AITA in this situation? I understand that he was upset I puked OUT the window, but I have a suspicion he was just trying to take advantage of me and my money when I was drunk.

When we came back after 10hours or so i went downstairs and found the basement bathroom light on. So i told him calmly that he did not switch off the light. He then snapped and told me he did not have to because he was not the one who turned it on in the first place. That I was the one who did and so i should have switched it off myself. I then said that imo the last person in the room should be the one who switch it off. So he said that i was stupid af (way more violently in our language) then and that he will not be accused of something he did not do and I should acknowledge that. It went on and on and we decided that we should do some major clean up then and beware of the one who would let something misplaced. Since i prefer not to talk to him nor interact with him. The day after as we still not were talking and as his was on his way out, he left the upstairs bathroom lights on. So i went to the car and told him.

I, m28, work nights. I’m a rather pale guy so every time I have to be up during the day my job likes to reflect in my appearance.

Seeing all my girlfriend's make up gave me an idea while I was getting ready, so I took a tube of simple concealer from her big make up stack and a cotton pad and did what I’d seen her do multiple times.

My girlfriend didn’t notice until we were at her parent's house, where she looked at me and seemed genuinely shocked about what I did. She then was moody the whole visit and kept glaring at me.

AITA for reminding my aunt that her son is actually her former neighbor's son?,"
My aunt (mom's sister) was married to my (now deceased) uncle who unlike our family was well off and worked in successful company. Everyone already knew that my aunt married him for money since she was younger but they were one of the happiest couples in the family surprisingly. she struggled with infirtility all her life and she and her husband couldn't have kids of their own which was devastating (I'm in the same boat right now) thing is their marriage survived not just that but also when my uncle knocked up their neighbor. My aunt decided to stick around still, they worked things out and my aunt ended up taking and raising the baby who's my cousin and whose name's Adam; he's 24 years old now and calls aunt 'mom'.


Like I mentioned my husband and I have been dealing with infirtlity for 4 years now. We want kids so badly and we'd already tried most options except for adoption which will be our final decision. We met my family at dinner to announce that my husband and I are adopting soon. Everyone seemed excited for us except for my aunt who got quiet then started talking about how irrational we must be for considering adoption while we're still young and have the chance to have our own kids and said that we should never encourage basically using women's unfortunate circumstances to buy their babies off them and think we'll love their babies more than them just because we have money which had me and my husband looking shocked. She basically shamed us for trying to take a baby away from their mother and called us cruel for taking this route. I was livid!!! at this point I just looked at her and said "" Well, at least my husband didn't go and knock up the neighbor seeing he's so desperate for a baby"" and reminded her that her son Adam (who was sitting at the table with us) was actually her poor neighbor's son that she bullied into giving away. But who am I to judge, right?. She was stunned, speechless. Adam suddenly got up from his seat looking pissed and stormed off his fiancee followed him out. 

My aunt then started yelling at me asking what the hell I was thinking to say this infront of Adam. I argued that it was the truth and besides she was being a hypocrite by shaming us for something she already did. She kept calling me heartless insensitive idiot for dragging Adam into this and hurting his feelings infront of everyone like that.

He said I was acting like a brat because instead of just accepting no as his answer I said ""are you serious"" . To me it was the principle and I was embarrassed to walk out of the store like that.  A couple days ago he bought me some moisturizer for 8 dollars and I asked the next time we were at the store if he would get me foundation for my face which is also 10 dollars or less.
I believe that everybody has their own way of doing things financially. But it's not like I'm frivolous spending his money.. it's a very rare occasion that I ask for anything. He does pay for food and necessities. And I've told him I will pay him back when my settlement comes and I fully intend to. Like I have every other time. One time I had 100 bucks and I just kept 20 and gave him 80 because I thought that was the fair thing to do. Then when I got 200 bucks from tax return he wanted 50 of it for gas. Gave it to him no problem. When I got my last paycheck (was only 50 bucks) I bought our movie  tickets to see top gun. I would NEVER have the audacity to bring this stuff up otherwise, I feel that it is petty/trashy/GROSS to throw money you've spent on someone willingly in the past in their face.. and I have the firm belief that all men should have been raised better than that. Especially if it's a rather insignificant amount. Anyways guys help me out here please, I feel that your opinions on the AITA are usually rather reasonable and put together. This is my first time posting on here or Reddit in general..


Mind you, neither of us are working right now. Were both recovering from severe health issues. Also I should add that his family gives him money- I on the other hand do not have that luxury. So its not like hes broke or hurting for money.


 In my opinion I don't ask for much. And if the tables were turned I would have easily handed over the petty dollar. No problem !!
Am I the AyeHole ??


Edit:: 
Let me just say that this is the first time I've asked him to buy me anything in 6 months of living together.... I don't ask him to take me shopping or get my nails done. EVER. NOTHING like that goes on. I asked him for a couple things over the last few days and his answer has been no everytime.

Should I even be with someone who doesnt seen eye to eye with me here ??

AITA for leaving my family at a restaurant after I finished my meal?,"I (23m) was forced to go on a family trip and I honestly can’t stand my family so this trip is a nightmare. 

My mother is manipulative to the point that I can’t make any decisions at all without her pulling “you just don’t care about me “ card. My father is to busy drinking to care and my brother is just putting fuel on the fire. 

They see me as the one who’s overreacting all the time. We where supposed to eat out and my family chose a meat restaurant. Im a vegetarian so I could only eat a salad and some fries. Normally this wouldn’t be an issue but 3 nights ago  my brother and father got me drunk on purpose so they could feed me meet.  I haven’t talked to either of them because of it. I didn’t wanna go out with them yesterday either but my mom pulled her card and brought up every time I “disappointed her” by not doing what she wanted me to do so I joined them just to make them shut up .

Well my father and brother tried to put meat on my salad and get me drunk again and just laughing at my expense. I ate my salad, took my things and left to the hotel. 

They came back to the hotel and man they called me all sorts of names, my father and brother thinks I’m pathetic for being a vegetarian my mom thinks I hate her and all of them are calling me an ah. 

Other family members have also told me to apologize. I’m starting to think I might have overreacted.  so AITA ?",Everyone Sucks
AITA grown son and his family not following the rules of house,"My grown son, his fiancé and their two, now three children moved into my house temporarily. I have rules that have been in place all of his life, one is that you eat three meals a day, a snack and sometimes desert. My son and his family refuse to follow this rule and will fix whole plates of food in between meals. If this was their own home, I would not have an issue with it, but my daughter who is still living at home and is around the same age as my son's stepson is not able to do this as it is a house rule and just not something that is needed, you do not need to eat whole meals in between meals, I have stated that if they are still hungry to eat an apple. They will also invite friends over with I am not home to have big cook out and does not make their fiends treat my house with respect, they will sit two to three people in my recliner, let their fiends' teenage kids put the smaller kids through the basketball hoop I got for my grandson, their friends spill cokes and leave empty food wrapper laying around. When I say something, I told I am overreacting or that he does not want to have a fight about it. Am I the asshole for wanting to be treated with respect in my home?

&#x200B;

Edit to post, it is not the grown adults that I ask to follow the rules of 3 meals a day, I ask my son to follow it with his kids, this is the same rule I followed as a kid, that my mother followed as a child and so forth, if you eat all of your food for breakfast, lunch and dinner all you should need is a snack, I have stated that eating apples, oranges, etc is okay as these are healthy,

As my daughter follows this rule, it is unfair to her to see her brother's kids getting allowed to do things she is not able to do and that have been the rules all of her life, my son knew my rules prior to moving in.

&#x200B;

I guess I am not explaining this correctly, or maybe I am, and everyone has been raised differently, all I know is that this was not the way in my house growing up or any of my friend's house, (as a kid or as an adult)

 we eat together, example Sunday morning is always donut day, for 6 people I buy 16 donuts, 12 pigs in a blanket, and a dozen donut holes, eat all you want, if you are hungry later and there are more, eat more, lunch could be a sandwich with chips or leftovers, eat all you want. snack could be anything, chips, fruit, popcorn, ice cream, granola bar, etc, you are hungrier fix you a sandwich or a bowl of reman, then dinner (this could be any number of food items depending on what is cooked), what I am against and where my rule comes in is when a kid comes home from school them going into the kitchen fix a large piece of chicken, a cheeseburger, and two hotdogs with corn on the cob. when Dinner will be started soon. or a kid sitting in the living room eating a large bag of chips, or a box of cookies and not fixing themselves something healthier.

AITA for uninviting mil’s fiancé to my wedding after he threatened to pour wine on me?,"For some background we aren’t very close to MIL or her fiancé. She feels we took FILs side in the divorce and she has always kept her distance.

The other day we were at my fiancé’s grandparents house. MILs sister made a joke that MIL should be one of those MILs and wear white. MIL just laughed. It doesn’t really seem like something she would do but I added that my bridesmaids would soak her in wine if she did. MILs fiancé said that would be hilarious because he would destroy my wedding gown. I asked what he meant and he said he would empty a bottle on me if any of my stupid friends did anything to her. MIL tried to move the conversation along but I have anxiety about stuff like that and it was bothering me. I said he can’t come to the wedding because I can’t trust him. 

MIL called me this morning and wanted to confirm if I was serious. I said I was (not the first incident, he has been rude in the past) MIL started crying and said she isn’t going to be around her ex husband without him. I said that was pretty vain but her choice. Now mil isn’t coming, which we don’t care too much but her whole side of the family is furious. Her dad might not come now which will bother my fiancé.",Everyone Sucks
AITA For Breaking Down Because My Bestfriend Slept Through Our Plans?,"Ok so for context in the shortest terms possible. About half a year ago I moved out with my best friend from our parents houses. We are both autistic and mentally ill, so we're both a bit odd. One of my big issues is plans being ruined. I understand if an emergency happens or someone misses there alarm but not when they intentionally mess up. Its one of my few boundaries and besides that I'm rather flexible. My RM doesn't have a job and hasn't for months, he had his BF move in with us without my full permission but this isn't about that.

My RM and I haven't hung out for about a month, and when we have hung out he's with his BF who absorbs a lot of his time and attention. Personal time together is one of my main love languages so when RM came into my room to talk about hanging out the next day I was buzzing with excitement. He made a whole list of stuff we can do all day after I get off work and it included a lot of my favorite things. I've been trying to hang out with him for a while now and he's either too tired, is asleep, or is hanging out with BF. When I got off work I ran into his room and he was asleep. BF told me they stayed up all night and just went to bed about an hour before I got off work. I was devastated. I went to my room and cried over it for hours. I told a mutual friend of ours, stable friend, who is more emotionally and mentally stable than either of us. They became LIVID and arranged for them to sleep over the next day because they wanted to comfort me. Around midnight, RM woke up and asked if I still wanted to hang out. I was like, ""Are you serious?"" but thought it would be the mature thing to do so we walked around the block with my dog. Every time I tried to mention I was upset, I was met with ""Ok"" or silence. I mentioned how plans are one of my only boundaries and RM said he didn't know, which is either a lie or he forgot. When we got home he offered to make me food but I was so nauseous being in the same space as him I denied. I then said goodnight. Rm asked if I was going to bed and I said no, but I just can't be around him for a while. Rm seemed sad and then I went to my room.

The next day, as soon as ST and I got into my room and closed the door, RM knocked. I opened it and Rm asked to hang out with us. I was shocked and just said I need more time. He understood and went back to his room. This was a few days ago. I asked to talk today because I just keep feeling worse, and he told me he had some serious emotional issues going on with a relative and he couldn't deal with this right now, which made me feel worse and really guilty. Especially since I finally gave SF permission to confront RM, something they've been wanting to do for months. SF messaged him and he said he can't do this today and to leave him alone and that this is a boundary. We both feel pretty bad. I don't know what to do at this point because we're both suffering right now and it sucks not being able to support each other. AITA? What do I do, Reddit?",Everyone Sucks
AITA..Husband is Costco obsessed. I hate Costco,"Husband (56M) loves shopping.  This drives me (52F) insane as we have way too many ""things"", but if it brings him joy to have 37 cases of tomatoes and 8 litres of olive oil, whatever. We can afford it, so I just ignore his semi-hoarder habits and carry on. If this is the biggest problem we have, life is good.

However... this sunny afternoon, the Sunday before Christmas, we were out for a nice day running errands.. UNTIL he suddenly decided to go to Costco. 

I HATE shopping - period. I especially hate Costco. Going on the Sunday before Christmas is a hard NO for me and I said so in a bitchy tone  as soon as he entered the zoo like parking lot because hey, I was bitchy about it ... who TF goes to Costco on this day - during omnicron surge -  unless they are insane. The parking lot was overflowing, can only imagine the inside. 

He peeled out of the parking lot very angry and said IWTA for not sucking it up and going to Costco with him. He likes it and I should join him in doing things he likes. 

He goes to Costco weekly for random shit we don't need, is retired and can go any day, any time, and without me. Every day of his life, alone, I DGAF. Or, could ask me to go any  quieter afternoon with him.

AITA for not wanting to hang out with my boyfriend’s friends?,"I know the title seems a little weird, but I’m really torn about this and I feel horrible. Disclaimer, I am on mobile so please excuse me for any formatting issues. 

My (23F) boyfriend (23M) and I got into a slight disagreement about an hour ago. He wanted me to go with him to hang out with a few friends of his. It was just two people and they’re a couple. I’ve met them before and they’re really nice, but I feel awkward whenever I’m around them. I’m not a super social person and I have a hard time holding conversations with people. When I’m around them I feel a little left out because I can’t relate to anything they talk about. My boyfriend has known them both since high school, so they always talk about past memories and things like that. I kinda just sit there awkwardly and it’s a little weird for me. 

During our disagreement my boyfriend mentioned how he considers his friends family and that he really wants me to hang out with them more. I completely understand that, but social interactions with new people are such a hassle for me and I don’t click with them at all. I explained to him that I’m not a social person and that I don’t like being around new people mainly because I’m shy and I’m awkward. It honestly makes me anxious. He told me that since I’ve said no before, I no longer have a choice in the matter. I got upset and kinda shut down a little. He walked out of the room for a second and came back asking me again if I was going, I told him no. He said he was going and left. 

I feel really bad. I know he wants me to come out of my shell and make friends. I know his friends are important to him. I feel like I should have sucked it up and went anyway. 

So dear Reddit, am I the AH here?


EDIT: I know my wording was a little weird here, but I have explained to my bf about feeling left out in conversation. Mentioning that they talk about things I can’t relate to. It was weeks ago when we had that conversation so I don’t remember his response. 

As far as him saying I don’t have a choice in the matter, I don’t think he meant that. This is the first time he’s ever said something like this but I know that it comes off controlling so I’m going to talk to him about it. 

The responses are pretty mixed and I’m taking everything that everyone says into consideration. So, with that being said I’m going to apologize to him when he gets back and I’m going to put in the effort to actually become friends with his friends. I’m also going to mention what he told me when I said no because I’m pretty sure that’s something that me and him needs to talk about.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for naming my daughter after my dead sister against my mom’s wishes?,"hey AITA! i never thought i’d be posting here, but here i am.

i (30F) am currently 5 months pregnant and i recently learned that i am having a girl! i also have a 3 year old son, who is named after his father. now that we know we are having a girl, we are talking more in-depth about names. my husband was dead set on a Jr, so i didn’t get to choose that name and i am enjoying thinking of possibilities.

to complicate things, my family has a long standing tradition of naming the first born daughter “Araminta” or a similarly old-fashioned and uncommon, mouthful type of name. my mom, my grandma, both their grandmas and their grandma’s grandmas are all “Araminta”. i am not the first born daughter, so my name is not Araminta, but my older sister died several years ago before she could pass along the name. while she was sick, we talked about the name and she said i should pass it down to my daughter should i have one.

now that the reality of the baby is looming, everyone is highly opinionated. my dad thinks that i promised my sister and i am therefore obligated to do as she asked. my mom is opposed, because she thinks my sister was the last Araminta and that i can’t rightfully pass down the name. my grandma just thinks that the name sucks and that it will hold the baby back. Hubby agrees with grandma.

last night, at a dinner, my brother’s wife suggested that we name the baby Ari, or some name that Ari can be a nickname for, since that was my sister’s nickname. i loved this idea! 

but of course, everyone has an opinion. my dad thought it was a great compromise, but it turns out my husband used to date a girl named Ariana, so it’s absolutely poisoned and can’t be used. cue the arguing between those two. my dad said i am TA for not honoring my sister’s wishes. my husband thinks i am TA because i didn’t abandon the idea second he voiced his opposition, never mind the fact he got the Jr he wanted. Mom thinks i am TA for not caring that she’s still grieving and doesn’t want a baby Araminta when her baby is gone.

i lost my temper. i told everyone that i was starting to really not care what ANYONE thinks. stormed off, had my sister in law take me and my son to Baskin Robbins, then went home.

my husband has since apologized for not taking into consideration the significance of the name, my word to my sister, and how conflicted i felt. but he still thinks i’m TA for not caring what he thinks.

grandma said i’m TA because i didn’t need to fly off the handle and disrespect my fragile mom.

and my 3 year old said just name the baby Pudding.

i feel generally terrible faced with the realization that i am going to hurt someone‘s feelings. and i’m really feeling like i might really be TA if i can’t figure out how to reconcile all of this.

AITA?

edit: thank you all for your insights and kindness! After sleeping on it and eating a good breakfast on it, i feel much more balanced and assured. it is a damned if i do/damned if i don’t situation, and knowing my family after we’ve been through what we’ve been through, when the dust settles i think they’ll see that.

this wasn’t the first time this came up, but we haven’t had a chance to really calmly talk about it - and i think that’s our problem. my parents are grieving in two completely opposite ways - dad clings, mom represses - and they are working on that, themselves.

i want to respect my mom, honor my sister, and give the baby a functional name (which the family name just ISNT). my husband and i both love the suggestion to use the name as a middle name and got a good laugh that it genuinely didn’t even occur to us in the heat of the moment!

my son is actually HILARIOUS and what makes it even funnier is he’s being 100% serious so he gets all offended if you laugh. My sonshine 💙

all your great name ideas are adorable but alas, the name isn’t actually Araminta!",Everyone Sucks

He told me to drop off his school charger right when I was about to eat. I told him that I expect to pick him up as well and he said no because he can't leave until 10:15 AM. 

I was disappointed because not only he made me drop off his charger but he expect me to pick him up in 1 hour. 

I told him that he needs to respect my time and he's better off staying until school ends and take the bus home.

He said I'm making a big deal out of it because it's only a 7 minute drive. If you think about it, it's 14 minutes in total back and forth.

I don't mind picking him up or dropping his charger but to do it in a 1 hour difference is what drives me mad.

"AITA for being upset that my (F17) partner (M20) and his close friends (M19?, F19) are going away without me?"," My partner will be Liam and his friends will be Lucas and Lucy.

In the past few years, my physical and mental health has taken a turn for the worse and recently was screened for health issues. Turns out it is not, but there are a few other issues so I still need surgery. This was planned to be in the middle of the 3 week holiday between my last year of high school so I do not miss anything important, and thus I am missing the holiday just after I turn 18.

Here's where the issue arises. Liam has decided that he wants to go on a trip for a week during this time, during my surgery and the first week of recovery with Lucas and Lucy, and told me that I can either reschedule my surgery (I don't think I can, it is only a month out) or deal with it. I have decided to just deal with it, I have been on trips (though unwillingly) without him and so I can handle it no matter how much it may suck. The main issue I am having mentally is that I already feel so excluded from their group, they all live together in the same flat and do everything together, while I only see them once a week, more only at certain times (long weekends, holidays). Liam has told me multiple times that me saying certain things and talking about certain topics is cringe and I cannot do it and has also been calling me rude due to how I act (social anxiety is something I struggle with a lot).

Last night we were at Lucas's grandparent's place and after I had gone to the bathroom I returned to hear them talking about activities they would be doing when they go up for their trip. I didn't understand at first (migraines make it hard to understand conversations sometimes) and when I finally caught on I got extremely upset and essentially mentally folded in on myself. I just couldn't and still don't understand why they would bring it up in front of me when they know I can't go. Here is where I may be the ahole:

During the car ride home I started crying. I didn't mean to, I didn't want to, and I for sure didn't want to talk about it. But Liam asked about it, and I told him I was still just upset about having to stay home because I was miserable. I then asked him if he could please not tell me about the trip because it would just make me so miserable to hear about how much fun he was having with his friends without me (again, I don't feel like I fit in, in reality, I don't). I get this is an asshole move, I should be supportive and happy for him, I should want to hear about it, but honestly with my mental state right now I just don't know if I can.

The argument escalated, I just kept crying and saying that I just want to protect my own mental health and I didn't want to talk about it in the first place, but he called me rude (I didn't talk enough at Lucas' parent's house), annoying and disgusting and closer to the end of the journey told me he would leave me if I seriously didn't understand that what I did was wrong and that he thinks I have BPD and I need to change and treat him better.",Everyone Sucks

I picked an argument with him and he kept asking me to ""relex dude"". I had it I started demanding that he remove the picture. He got up and started telling me that I should stop going crazy over a picure and that I was being ridiculous, then asked my wife to say something. but she just watched.

Things got heated and we had to leave, My wife said I made a scene over nothing, I asked how and why she waw fine with Michael overstepping, she said he's obviously struggling with abandement issues but he's a good friend who values his friend, and that it's just a stupid background wallpaper anyway and I should let it go because she was sure that Michael is mentally struggling and considers her family. besides the picture included his son too so it wasn't just her.

I told her that's how I want to do it because I HATE large gatherings, even if it's all the people I know. She then proceeded to tell me that she'll be pissed during the reveal because I'll already know. And now she's expecting me to tell her. But I'm not going to.

Now all of a sudden she has a big problem and says I’m a bad boyfriend I’m not there for her or her mom, how disappointing, etc. For some more context I have been studying for my professional exams for a long time so I don’t see my girlfriend often, since her mom is in there I have been trying to talk to her on the phone more.
Now she says I don’t even understand, and strongly implied her mom is upset and that she said she’ll lremember who visited her and who didn’t"". I feel like everything I do is wrong and people are always having a problem with me. As a little side note, I have always thought her family was dramatic, however I understand this was a serious situation.

"AITA for telling my GF I was embarrassed by the way she handled losing her phone, ID, and debit card in the river on my sisters bday?","
I (21M) have been dating my gf (19F) for around 6 months now. We went to my hometown last weekend for my sisters birthday. She wanted to go river tubing with a few of her friends that were 25 and up for her bday. I am really close with my sister and have a good relationship. This is the first time my gf has met my sister in person so I think we were both a little nervous for it to go good. Anyways, we brought lots of seltzers and beers and were having a good time with everyone. When we are about 30 minutes from being done my gf gets out of her tube to get in the water and cool off, when she gets out I noticed something of hers fell in the water. So I tell her that something of hers fell in, turns out it was her phone with her I.D and debit card attached on the back. When we realize we all get out and try to find it in the water or on the rocks below. We’re searching for 5-10 min when it’s pretty apparent it’s gone, since it is a river and the water keeps on moving. The whole time we’re looking my gf is balling her eyes out and saying it’s got to be right here. My sister tells her that’s it’s gone and she’s sorry that happened. My gf tells her that she’s just tipsy and is not even helping her look. I back up gf bc my sister did seem a little insensitive but was also right in saying that the phone was gone. We finally get back in the tubes and are trying to finish it out, my gf with her arms crossed, still crying and not talking to anyone is really killing the mood.

Eventually she calms down when we get home about an hour and half later after she calls her mom. A few days later I just mention to her I was a little embarrassed by the way she handled that situation with everyone around and wish she tried to at least put on a front until we got home. She got really mad and said I care more about what others think about me then being there for her. How she lost everything and has a right to be emotional, which I’m not disagreeing with I just think she overreacted and didn’t need to throw a fit in front of my sister and her friends and made her look a little immature.

AITA for leaving my friend on read because she did that to me?,"Hear me out. I am not normally petty like this.   
My best friend of 6/7 years, has lately had a full 180 switch. She's been leaving me on read, ignoring any time i reach out to hangout, saying i can come over to see her puppy and not telling me it's just her BF home and she's out of town etc. We've both been through some shit lately (even where we met was a toxic workplace) and she's been SO busy so i let it rest, didn't protest. I sent her a message a few weeks ago about like i know you're super busy, but i'm worried about you, let me know if there's anything i can do to help you out kinda deal. Again i get left on read.   


Last week she asks me not to attend the sports/classes she teaches (where i'm not a student but i help with set up and tear down and tend to hangout cuz some of her students are mutual friends of ours) due to ""multiple complaints"" about spectators being a distraction (even though i'm fairly certain one or two other spectators have not been asked not to come). I totally respect that even though it kind of sucks since that's been the only time i get to see her at all lately. So i say like ""yeah that's fine, is that why you've been leaving me on read lately? Because we could've just talked it out."" (we've talked out a lot of sh\*t in our time and called each other out on a lot of our sh\*t too) , well that opened the floodgates and she went off on my about how she's trying to move on, she doesn't have time for a social life etc. etc. Basically it was a lot of really hurtful stuff that sounded like a bunch of excuses just to not hangout with/ talk to me anymore. This was totally out of the blue and all i've ever done (to my knowledge) is help her out and have her back and encourage her to chase her dreams.  I told her my intentions were only ever good and she said it was appreciated but continued to say hurtful things , so i told her we could talk after work when we'd both calmed down some if she wanted.   


It's been crickets since then.   


Until today she messages out of the blue in a group chat that's the two of us + one other person just as an update on an old mutual client. I left her on read and didn't even acknowledge the message.

"AITA for ""snitching"" on a coworker for spitting on a customer's food?","I work as a server at a popular chain restaurant. Last Saturday it was a very stressful day as we were extremely busy. One of my coworkers, let's call her Tanya, was in an especially bad mood due to the amount of customers assigned to her section. 

The issue started when one of the customers ordered chicken strips with buffalo sauce on the side. As Tanya was walking with her tray of food, the sauce dish tipped over and spilled some buffalo sauce over the customer's fries and basked potato. 

I'm guessing she didn't think it was a big deal to have some hot sauce on your potatoes. So she brought it to the customer anyway. 

Well the customer eventually called her back and asked for new fries and a new potato because they didn't want buffalo sauce all over their food. Tanya came back to the kitchen unreasonably upset. She was complaining about spoiled people, wasting food, extra work, and things like that. 

 The cook made a new plate of food and as Tanya was walking out of the kitchen she stuck out her tongue and spit little flecks of spit all over the customer's food. I was shocked because I'd never actually seen someone do that in real life. I thought that kind of thing only happened in movies and TV shows. I was even more surprised that she did it during a pandemic. 

At the end of my shift i told my boss what I saw and he had a talk with Tanya afterwards. 

Now everyone i work with knows that I did this, since my boss told Tanya that i saw her spit on the food. They're all calling me a snitch. Tanya herself calls me ""the snitch"" if she ever has to refer to me, she no longer speaks to me at all. 

I believe even my boss isn't happy that I ""snitched"", though he hasn't said anything directly. I just feel a whole different vibe from him now. 

It's gotten to the point where i basically lost all of my work friends due to snitching. I'm not sure they will ever get over this because of how legitimately upset everyone is. I'm considering finding a new job because it has gotten so bad. 

Am i the asshole for ""snitching""? Should i have just talked to Tanya privately and not told her boss?",Everyone Sucks

AITA for changing the color of my suit without telling my wife?,"I(29M) and my wife(26F) were going to my best friend's wedding. I got a custom made suit that was very very dark red(almost black) coloured because I wanted to look good as the best man. My wife, decided to get a matching dress done for herself as well. I told her I did not want to twin with her but she insisted and bought the same colored dress as mine. 
She would obviously not return it so I took matters into my ownhands and got the colour of my suit changed to dark green(which was again almost black). 

I asked my suitmaker to keep the suit with him until a few days before the wedding so that my wife wouldn't go buy the same coloured dress for herself again. 

When I got it home the day before the wedding, my wife was shocked and hurt. She called me an AH for gatekeeping what she gets to wear and that I shouldn't have gone behind her back for such a petty reason. 

AITA?

Edit : since a lot of people are asking this I'll clear it up. My best friend, the groom and his fiancee are ok with it. They did not want any specific colours to be imposed on the best man, moh, bridesmaids and groomsmen. They said we could wear anything that didn't look like their wedding attires. 

The bride was wearing a princess belle coloured knee length dress and the groom was wearing a navy blue suit. 

My wife is not in the wedding party. She's coming since she's my wife.

Edit 2: I was the best man and wanted to look good for the one wedding I actually got to go. He's one of my closest friends. She always(I mean literally everyday, we even have a matching wardrobe all in pastel colours. Although, pastel colours make me feel less masculine and I feel uncomfortable in those colours) wants to match. Or wardrobes are exactly the same. I hate it. I wanted to wear something I like just this once. Maybe she should've been happy looking at me for once. I always wear what she wants to wear anyway.

WIBTA for telling my sister I don't want to live with her because of how she treats my pets?,"For context, I (26 NB) live with my 2 partners (M23 and M22) along with my sister (F23). When we first moved away to uni, it was me and my sister with our 2 gerbils, it's now been 3 years. 

To start with she never paid for anything the gerbils needed, whenever I stopped overnight at my M22 bf's house, I needed to make sure they had food and water because she couldn't be bothered to check. Then I started spending a couple of days a week at his, as they were ours and I paid for everything we thought she could be trusted to top up the food and water. I came back a few times to find she'd left them to starve because she forgot they were there. 

I took them to the vets for a checkup, explained what had happened and I also took complete ownership of the gerbils much to sisters disgust, and my M22 bf started to care for them with me. 

She started taking a more active role with them after pleading for a second chance, took them home last Christmas after much begging on her end. When they came home they were skittish, breathing oddly and underweight. Their bedding hadn't been changed in a month and they'd basically barley been getting by despite the fact I'd given her everything they needed. I told her to keep the hell away from them then. 

When my second partner moved in with us, my original gerbil was being hand fed due to failing health. Both my partners work and I am disabled, due to this, my sister was allowed to help with the feeding and there were a couple of incidents of my gerbil doing leaps of faith but he was okay, always caught except one time which occurred under her watch. We are unsure if that one time was what led to us having him put to sleep or not and the vet advised us to keep an eye on his brother. 

Due to this we all took turns having him out and interacting with him. We also have a hamster who he has his cage next to and they chitter away quite happily when he's not out. He seems to be doing good expect struggling to keep weight on as he's an old boy now (3.5 yrs) so we've took to giving him a hand feed once a night. 

Now to the issue that's caused this, sister came to me last night and said he'd almost fell but she'd caught him, could I check he was okay. Then tonight she says he fell badly, he is alright but his mouth is understandably tender and he's very grouchy. We, admittedly may be TA as the 3 of us kicked off at her, we realised she'd been on her phone and not paying any attention (she told us this) and I've since said she's not to go near either pet.

AITA for asking my husband to shower in the other bathroom on early mornings?,"My husband and I live in a small house up in the mountains where we moved after I got a huge promotion at work. We genuinely enjoy living here and the location allowed us to afford a home. 

He is able to work from home almost every day, though once a week, at most, he is required to drive up to two hours into the city. They are long days where he wakes up at 4 am and doesn’t come home until 10 pm since he waits out traffic by catching up with his friends over happy hour. 

Most days my job requires I wake up around 5:30 am. We normally get up together after cuddling and enjoy the start to our morning, after which I go to work and he will then go on a hike since he doesn’t start working from home until 8:30.

This leads us to this week. I’ve been in pretty bad shape after an oral surgery and unable to sleep through the past few nights. After refusing to shower the night before because he was tired, he turns the lights to our adjoined bathroom on (we have no door, just a short hallway) and begins to shower at 4 am. This wakes me up after only getting 3 hours of sleep and I am grumpy. I, somewhat regrettably, send a text to him letting him know that I would appreciate it if next time he needs to shower super early he can use our other shower, which is in another part of the home but still mere steps away from our bedroom. At least there is a door he can shut.

He gets out of the shower, goes downstairs, turns all the lights on in the process, GRINDS COFFEE BEANS and turns on the clothes-dryer. 

At this point I am fully awake and before he gets a chance to read the text I warn him that I sent a grumpy text, and explain that I didn’t get a lot of sleep again. This leads to a fight where he ultimately threatened to sleep in another room since I don’t appreciate him waking up everyday with me when I go to work. 

I offered solutions, like going to bed earlier, prepping the coffee/clothes the night before, and waking up with him on these early mornings but it still ended poorly with hurtful words being said and the general consensus from him that he doesn’t feel appreciated.

AITA for giving my(21M) female friend(20F) boy advice?,"So my friend has a really bad streak with men. Idk why. She’s great and deserves so much more than what the guys she fucks with provide.

I’m one of two guys in a 5 person friend group, and she talks about her issues with men a lot. She has messed around with guys who have girlfriends and promise to leave them, guys who have side girls, guys who steal from her, guys who only want her for an easy lay, just genuinely not great guys. I feel like she could do so much better.

The girls in my friend group give very feminine advice. Advice that simple doesn’t work on men. “Hold out on sex till a month, act like you have other men, play hard to get, etc.” This advice never works and she ends up getting played again.

Me and the other guy don’t tell them because, well we don’t want to give up the tricks of the trade. But it’s hurts to see other men using those tricks on her. 

Right now she’s talking to a guy that only hits her up at night to get her to come over.  And the advice given was god awful. Specifics she was told to go over, but refuse to have sex with him and it’ll make him respect her.

I kinda snapped. I asked her if I could be completely honest with her about this. She said yes. I told her that she needs to drop him. He knows she likes him and that’s why she keeps coming over. He knows what she wants and he doesn’t care, he will lead her on for sex as long as she allows herself to be lead on. He doesn’t want her, he wants a pussy to fuck. I also said that the reason guys do this to her is that she lets herself be treated that way.

She started crying. I’ll admit that I was very blunt, but I didn’t think I was being mean. Everyone else thought the opposite. My girl friends were mad at me for saying what I said and said it was terrible advice and my guy friend was mad at me for giving up secrets.

AITA for suing to overturn my daughter's adoption?,"I was in a horrible relationship with a woman I'll call Christi. She was a very toxic person and at best a borderline alcoholic. I hate to armchair diagnose, but she is spot on for BPD. Constant paranoia about everyone and everything, wild mood swings. I realized I had a problem and needed to cut ties with her to move on and fix myself and that's when she announced that she was pregnant. She stopped drinking while pregnant, but her behavior didn't really change, if anything, it got worse. 

I blocked her for a few months after there was a particularly bad incident that made me relapse, but I had every intention of being there for my child and made sure she knew that. When she would have been 8 months pregnant, a mutual friend called me and said she had had a stillbirth. I had no reason to not believe that friend but I just couldn't risk seeing her again and getting sucked back in, so I texted her condolences and have kept her blocked in every way that I could since. 

8 years have passed. I married my wife 2 year ago, we have a child, and I just passed 7 years sober. I went back to visit my parents last July (same town), and saw some old friends, some of whom would have known Christi. One mentioned that Christi's daughter just had her postponed birthday party. Her 8th birthday party, ie this kid would have had the exact due date as Christi's ""stillbirth"". AKA, she had my child. 

Christi married some guy, had two more children and had him illegally adopt my daughter. I now want to sue her to overturn the adoption because she clearly had someone lie to me so I wouldn't try fighting for my parental rights.

AITA from banning my boyfriend in giving money to support his 3 year old daughter,"Disclaimer: English is not my first language so expect some grammatical error.

I, 24F, is in a relationship with my boyfriend 29M. We are in a healthy relationship and I know the existence of his daughter from his ex. I still accepted him and love him unconditionally despite all of that. By the way, I’m still in college finishing my second college diploma, single and has a part time job. Given that, I promise to compromise with him since I know he is giving financial support to his daughter for her daily needs like formula milk, diapers and emergencies. I keep understanding his situation despite all of that because I love both them. On the side note, his cheating ex left her daughter and my boyfriend during the 4-month of the child leaving my boyfriend heartbroken and nothing. My boyfriend’s family raised his daughter with no trace from the girl for the first 2 years. My boyfriend even persuaded his ex before to get back together for the sake of their family which the ex refused. Over the past few years, my boyfriend was in a relationship already with some females and this ex kept bugging and begging him to get back together which my boyfriend declined. Last year, the girl decided to take their daughter and ask money from my boyfriend for his financial support to the child. At first, I don’t care how much money he gives since I’m the one providing for us two. But I noticed from the past few months that the ex was asking more than twice than the supposed “financial support”. They didn’t have a written agreement about this and it’s too expensive to hire a lawyer from my country. We don’t have much paternal rights or courts to support this claim. Apparently, this ex has vices too like smoking and drinking. On top of that, she doesn’t have work and we don’t know why. I was so mad about this and told him to stop sending money to his ex and just send groceries. I even offered to pay for the child’s insurance in case of emergencies which the girl refuses since “it will not help them”. From this day onwards, the ex blocked my boyfriend together with his family and refuses to communicate nor give my boyfriend his visiting rights to the child. So, I am the a$$hole for banning my boyfriend from sending money to his daughter?

EDIT: it’s been a while since I haven’t read what you guys thought. Anyway, I forgot to mention that the baby mama has been in a relationship too with a single dad of 3 kids. They have been compromising my boyfriend’s child and keep asking money from my boyfriend.

UPDATE: Ever since we have stopped giving her money for 1 month, she left their child again with my boyfriend because she can’t afford to pay for anything now. We may suck for y’all but we don’t think she deserves any money from us. Again, we are not from United States and we don’t have financial agreement about this and she stopped my boyfriend’s visiting rights for 3-4 months. We asked his daughter what happened during her stay at her mom’s place and she keeps telling us that her mom will spank her anytime and showed us a lot of bruises. The child was brought by the baby mama’s sister in my boyfriend’s house. We have no contact with the mom because she doesn’t want to give her address.

AITA for driving my sister's dog crazy?,"Context: sister (29F) has had a dog for about a year now. She is (meant to be) the sole carer of the dog and he is her responsibility entirely. This was the agreement as no one else at home wanted a dog. 

EDIT: Important stuff I think is important to understand my position, but in no way excuse me. When we first got the dog, my sister would leave him in a locked play pen all day. He would bark and cry. If I had a break that day id take him outside to sit in the sun, use the bathroom etc. After 9 months of this I told my sister she had to find somewhere else for him to stay throughout the day. I said this as he deserves to be out and playing like a normal dog. She still refused and thought he was fine, so I told her that I would no longer take him out (including bathroom breaks) which meant she HAD to find a new, safe space for him to stay throughout the day. She refused to put him anywhere else, but she would call me throughout the day asking me to take him out. 

 
This dog barks all day, endlessly. I work from home and take calls with customers and colleagues, and he can be heard through the phone, whereas my sister goes into the office. She leaves him locked in the laundry when she's not home. My room has an attaching chute to the laundry so I can very clearly hear this dog whenever he barks/cries. His living conditions are bad in my opinion, he doesn't get to run around during the day, feel the sun or be a normal dog. I've told her it's inhumane to leave him like that, she doesn't listen. 

I asked her to find somewhere else for him to stay, not in the laundry, so that I don't have to listen to him cry all day. He's gonna cry and bark regardless because of his circumstances, I just don't want to hear it all day.
 
Now in this past year, I've learned what triggers my dog. The main thing is bassy music. He doesn't understand it and just barks. I have chosen the warpath

Because my sister has just blatantly disregarded his barking and my problem with it, I've decided to start triggering my dog when she's home. She's told me to ""just put headphones in and drown him out"". I decided that headphones wont work because i dont want to wear them all day, so the next best thing is music loud enough to drown him out 

I'll play loud bassy music outside my room with the door closed. I'll also knock on my desk occasionally to mimic someone knocking at the front door (dog will bark for 20 mins if someone is at the front door and knocking).

Here's the real kicker. When she is home, if he barks for more than 5 minutes straight, she will go nuts and tell him to shut up. She can't stand his barking for 5 mins, but she expects me to just suck it up for 8+ hours a day. This is the exact reason I've chosen this revenge. 

So, AITA for driving my dog crazy while my sister is home?

Edit: I know what I'm doing is really shitty. I really don't know what else to do. If anyone has any other ideas to get my sister to understand that the barking all day isn't okay? I've already spoken to her about professional trainers, staying consistent with training, and even rehoming when nothing has worked.

To those who have said ""just take the dog out when hes in distress"", I used to do this, but this enabled my sister to keep passing off responsibility and not actually do anything to change his circumstances, which is why I have since stopped doing anything for the dog

FINAL EDIT: Yall have gotten to me. Im gonna stop riling the dog up when my sisters home. I will figure out a way to fuck with my sister directly without collateral. I only came up with this plan a few days ago and I know I was blinded by my frustration, so thank you for destroying any ego I had towards this matter. I admit that my frustration caused me to view the dog as a pawn and not really consider the effects this has on the dog. I will try to be better for the dog. Thank you kind assholes (/s) of the internet for forcing me to quit my bullshit and  forcing me to learn how to deal with this in an appropriate, mature manner",Everyone Sucks
AITA for laughing when my friend said animal cruelty was important to her?,"I’m a vegetarian. I have one friend, C, who has always seemed to have a problem with my diet. She’ll do things like wave bacon in my face and ask how I could give up something so delicious, or she’ll offer me meat and when I remind her I’m vegetarian, she’ll say “that’s fine, I eat enough meat for the both of us.” She even once sent me an anti-vegan TikTok, but I told her I’d block her if she did it again. 

Anyway, I went out to dinner the other night with A, some of our other close friends, and a couple new friends we met recently. We end up discussing politics and what issues are most important to us. One of the new guys mentions animal cruelty as being very important to him. C chimes in agreeing. I let out a little involuntary laugh. She turns to me and asks why I’m laughing. I say “I just never got that vibe from you.” She responds “Of course I care about animal cruelty. I’m one of the biggest animal lovers I know. I don’t know how anyone can hurt innocent creatures.” I point to the hamburger she’s eating and say “Tell that to the cow on your plate.”

The rest of the group laughed and I didn’t think it was a big deal since we all insult each other sometimes. But later she said I’m a bitch and that she fosters cats and I had no reason to shame her. Another friend said I embarrassed here, which I do feel bad about.

We have a very large front yard as our house is a small shoe box one bed that sits almost directly flush with the alley. there are homes behind us along a busy main road. the house directly behind us has had the same residents since my father moved in. when we moved in, we were unaware of the MULTIPLE animals they had, and at the time their yard was NOT fenced at all. they had two very large turkeys about 30-45lbs each, 3 chickens, two ducks, and 3-4 dogs. first it was just the animals in our yard then a few months into living here i’m home alone and suddenly hear a blood curdling scream that is obviously a child. i look out the window, there’s 4 kids outside of said window, one on the ground crying, another holding a little tikes plastic kid chair. the ones standing over the crying child take off upon seeing me. by the time i got outside the kids were gone. that december we had adopted a dog with an iffy history, and was very selective. i forgot to mention earlier but our yard is not fenced in. once we saw the kids again we asked them to please stay out of our yard for their safety. (her being a pit, we couldn’t add her to our renters insurance) they ignored us, and one night they were walking through our yard, and it was pitch black as it was around 10pm. the dog saw them before i did (these were the older kids, they have 3 teens and 3 younger kids around 6-10) the dog took off running after them, because we didn’t leash her in the yard as she had very good recall off leash. everyone was okay but we again told them to stay out of our yard to avoid this again. fast forward a bit, we get into a small altercation with the parents over something not involving the kids. they end up setting up a privacy fence along just the back part of their yard, so the sides were still completely open. their animals are continuously in our yard STILL, and i have resorted to telling them every time i see them which has been 5+ times in the last month alone riding and leaving their bikes in our yard. i understand that they’re kids but this has been ongoing for four years now. we even said something to the parents the night we had our altercation that we just want the kids to stay out of the yard for their own safety and protection, besides we are STRANGERS why are you playing in our yard to begin with? we have also had to call animal control multiple times on them because their animals run wild constantly! i’m at my wits end we’re putting up no trespassing signs that face their yard (which they ironically did as well when they put up the privacy fence) i don’t want to call the police because theyre kids but its getting so frustrating at this point because its like we never get a moment of peace in our own home anymore because these kids and animals are constantly in our yard.

AITA for selling a Christmas gift while still at Christmas dinner?,"I (43F) was raised by a family that never legally adopted me since I was under 1 year, so my last name is different from my parents and siblings.

I told my SIL I had sold it and thanked for the gift. (Side note SIL doesn't drink coffee either and also never has.) The last several family events since Christmas have been progressively more awkward between us now to the point of no speaking or eye contact, so I asked my other brother what her problem with me is.

AITA for charging my roommate $10 for having to reorganize my beads,"I (29f) do a lot of beading with smaller beads. A couple of weeks ago I accidentally spilled my beads and had to organize them back into the container. It took 2 days at working on it for 3-4 hours straight. I got a couple of very similar colors mixed up, like 2 shades of red and 2 shades of green. 

My roommate(29f) loves to organize colors. I'm not kidding when I say she will sit for hours in her room coloring lines on pages to figure out which green marker comes first and how to order her pens. She literally had notebooks full of colored lines. 

When she saw that my beads were a little mixed she asked if she could fix it. I told her yes. She didn't like the order I had my colors in, so she asked if she could dump it out and start over. I told her as long as she finished it in the next day or 2 that it was OK. Well, that was a mistake, and I should have known better because she can't even get off her lazy a** to help with apartment chores, and she only worked 2 days a week. If you cane into our apartment you would know who keeps up with the apartment by looking at our rooms. Mine is clean and organized, like the apartment, her room is a dumpster, a fire and health hazard. 

It has now been a week and a half since she dumped the brads and has only taken an hour and a half out of her ""busy"" schedule to barely get any of my beads reorganized. She actually started a new job yesterday so as of now she's working 7 days a week. I know she won't have time to fix this so I am stuck reorganizing them for a 2nd time! 

I told her last Friday if she didn't get to them within a week I was going to buy a new set on Amazon and she'd have to pay for them. This has been a HUGE inconvenience all week, and she has seen me beading everything she leaves her room and says absolutely nothing. I went onto Amazon today to fins the set with no luck, but similar sets with beads of the same size and about of beads are currently going for $10 so I have decided to charge her $10 (which I feel like I am being very lenient since this is another at least day of work for me to fix) to organize them. 

I owed her $90 for electric but am only giving her $80. She is now upset with me since I initially told her when I buy the new beads she could just have these, but to me that doesn't make sense, and I'm not going to fix her mess for nothing. 

So AITA for charging my roommate $10 for having to re organize my beads that she purposely dumped out?",Everyone Sucks
AITA for not helping my friends and being petty?,"Hey Reddit. I did something petty but I need help knowing if I was right or not.


So after a long day of college, I was feeling tired and decided I needed some juice while having lunch. (I stay in a hostel so we have to eat food at those community lunch areas with everyone). So I was having lunch with my friends A and B and other common friends.

Anyways, I ate lunch quickly so I could go get my juice (the juice shop is just outside our eating area but it's in the open so you pretty much have to stand in the sun). 

After 10 min, just when I received my order, I got a call from A that they wanted juice too. I was like okay fine and I got one for her too.

And once again after 10 min B calls and gives me her order. I was annoyed at this point but I gave in. Thankfully I had company at the juice shop as some other person I know was also there. (Lets call her C)



When all the 3 orders were ready, I realised that I had no way of getting 3 cups with my 2 hands. C offered to help me (she was also going to have lunch so it was convenient)  but I said no and called A to get their ass out here as I needed help, so C left. A was visibly annoyed and asked me why I didn't ask C for help and I just said I didn't notice. 

C must have figured out I was being petty so they told A and now A was angry with me and said I am not a nice person that I can't even help my own friends. In return I said that I don't care as I was tired too and in the future if they make me do stuff like this which they can clearly do themselves, I will do the same thing again. 



Now I understand we were all tired but A and B made me stand for 30 min in the sun, while they could have accompanied me. Also I will add that me and A finished lunch at the same time, so she was pretty much free to come with me but didn't. (I will cut B some slack since she was still eating at that point)

I get very annoyed when people make me do stuff that they can very easily do, but now I feel bad that I did what I did. Am I in the wrong here? Should I just have sucked up and did what they asked me to ?

I might be the asshole as they only asked me for a one time help and I did not wanna do it and might have been rude to say that I'd do it again.",Everyone Sucks
WIBTA for reporting someone for academic dishonesty because they didn't pay me for writing their essay,"I'm a college student. I'm struggling badly. I currently work 2 jobs totaling about 30 hours. I need more money to pay housing and tuition, both of which have skyrocketed badly over the past year, but neither of my jobs will guarantee me more hours (I'm lucky if I get 40 a week.) As such, I have a side hustle on campus, mostly just things like proofreading/editing essays and helping people move in/out of their dorms. Honestly nothing crazy.

In May, near the end of the previous semester, someone reached out to me and asked if I could help write their final essay because she wanted to get a head start on summer vacation and was planning a trip with her friends. It was a 5-8 page essay and we agreed on $120 for submission and more if she got a good grade. I couldn't turn that down because well, money, to secure a roof over my head and everything y'know.

Everything was going smoothly during the whole process; we were very communicative with each other. When I sent her the finished essay, she said she would send me the payment in the morning and I said no worries. But the next day passed and it didn't come, so over the next 2 weeks, I sent her several messages about it and she still did not pay. Eventually she broke down and told me how she was struggling really badly as a single mother and how she can't even pay for baby care essentials, and asked if I could provide leniency. I know she has a kid and everything, but I was skeptical because she literally told me she was going on a trip with friends. I told her just to give me as much as she could right now, even if it was just $10, so I know she isn't being completely dishonest.

She didn't pay me anything. Later I saw on her Instagram that she was out with her friends, and I called her out on her shit. She told me she would've paid me, but that she injured her foot during the trip and had a bunch of medical bills to pay. And look, I get it-- I'm sympathetic to a degree-- I'm also one of millions of Americans who don't have health insurance and would be completely bankrupted by a minor hospital bill-- but at that point, it had been a month, I had done the work and provided the labor, and been paid $0.

We had a conversation. I threatened to report her to the school for academic dishonesty. She called me a POS and has blocked me on Instagram. I contacted her on Facebook the next day, and I told her that she completely scammed me, and that she's the real POS for not paying up. She blocked me on that too. I'm still thinking about reporting her to the school, WIBTA?

Edit: Some of you are saying this could be a risk to me as well, as I also participated in academic dishonesty. I forgot to mention that this person goes to a community college in the same town, not my own school. We met at the same school, but I have since transferred to university. ",Everyone Sucks
AITA: Hoked At People Unloading Car At The Airport,"I'm driving to the Las Vegas Airport to pick up my 83 year old aunt. My 80 year old mom is in the truck with me. I pull into the short term parking lot so we can park and go find my aunt in the airport since she gets lost easily.   


Anyway as I am driving around the short term parking lot, I end up behind this SUV, they get close to the passenger pick up area and stop in the middle of the lane, and 2 women and 3 men get out of the SUV and open up the back hatch of their SUV and start hugging each other and start taking their luggage out of the car. They are probably in their late 40s early 50s in their khaki shorts and polo shirts. Because its short term parking each lane is a one way with enough room for only a single vehicle, and I'm in a Ford F150 so there is no room to go around them.   


Anyway I roll down the window and honk at them (not just a quick beep but a full on 2 second HONK), they all look at me like I'm the asshol\*\*. The look of ""How dare you honk at us"" is written all over their face as they raise their hands palms up in disbelief that someone would actually honk at ""THEM"". I yell out the window ""Move your Fu\*\*in car"" ... they keep staring at me like ""I'm the assho\*\*"" so I yell out the window ""You people are the definition of white privilege.""  


They jump back in their SUV, one guy yells at me ""Move back to Jersey"", which I find odd considering I have never lived in Jersey and have Nevada license places on my truck. They leave the back hatch up and drive to the nearest open parking spot. I drive past them and also park in a nearby parking spot. My mom tells me ""stop it"" but I just ignore her and we get out. I wanted to walk by their car and thank them for choosing to participate in a civilized society where we follow the rules, but I end up following my mom down toward the passenger pick up area not walking past their SUV. We have to walk by the spot were the incident happened and there is this blue sign saying ""No parking, or unloading your car will be ticketed or towed"" .. so Keep ranting about how I cannot stand entitled people and then we get into the airport and get my aunt.

AITA for hanging up on my mom after she said she’d take away my cats?,"This happened barely even an hour ago and it’s still all I can think about. For context I have two cats, Pluto and Julius. I got Pluto first and since the moment I brought him home he’s been a glutton. I’ve talked to multiple vets if this was a problem and if there was any way to help it after I adopted Julius (because he was used to free-eating instead of scheduled times to eat).  Every vet I’ve talked to has told me that no, it doesn’t sound like a huge problem it’s just his personality. He’s not aggressive with food just very “food-driven”. 

So onto the problem at hand: I’ve recently got more “gogurt” treats for the cats (like the squeeze tube treat that is literally like gogurt for cats) and Pluto has always been obsessed with these type of treats. I keep them in the hall closet in my apartment where I keep the rest of their food and treats. Recently I’ve noticed that the door doesn’t close all the way and you have to push it in completely to latch it. Without realizing that the door hasn’t been closed all the way, Pluto has gotten into the closet and eats as many of the gogurt treats as possible before I or my boyfriend catch him. 

Today, Pluto threw up once at 6am and then twice around 5pm. When this happens I usually know that he’s trying to throw up the plastic from the gogurt treat that he chewed through. I called my mom and asked her for help on how to get it out of my couch this morning and my carpet just now and she was helpful in cleaning it up. As we were on the phone, I said something like “Am I going to have to take him to the vet to get his stomach pumped?” and my mom replied to this by saying no she’ll just put him down. I was APPALLED that she would say that to me when my cat is barely a year and a half old and called her out on it. She backtracked this statement and then said that she would just come take away my cats from me because I am not taking care of them properly because of this situation with Pluto. I once again got frustrated with her and called her out on that and she explained why she said that. I listened to her explanation and understand that yes, as their caretaker I have to be careful that this doesn’t hurt my cat, but what I don’t understand is why she thinks she needs to take my cats from me? I feed them properly, they constantly have water out, they always have a clean litter box, and enough toys and affection to last them an eternity. 

She continued rambling things to me and I just couldn’t listen to her anymore so I said I needed to clean up this throw up and hung up on her. I hate ending conversations like that because even now as an adult I get berated by her for hanging up like that in heated conversations. She even texted me after I hung up and said”Wow. Okay.” and a few minutes later “I hope you feel better” and i’m not sure what she really meant by this. So AITA? Should I have found a more civil way to end the conversation?

Update: I appreciate the comments and feedback from everyone that took the time to read my post. Thank you to those that helped me also change my behavior to help my cats health. From some of your suggestions, I bought a large tub with latches to store their food and any treats that can be ripped open or chewed through. Everything is now securely scared away in this tub in our hall closet, and I have asked my boyfriend to look into fixing the hall closet door so it actually closes properly.",Everyone Sucks
AITA for telling my girlfriend she sucks at a competitive game ?,"Me M 17 told my F 19 girlfriend that she is horrible in league of legends and that I feel bad for carrying her weight up on the rankings because it is unfair to people that are actually trying to win and better than her to lose to someone who is so bad while she trashtalks them typing more than playing.


It happened years ago, I was 17, she was 19, she teached me how to play and we would do it every single day, when I finished school I had a lot more time to play and got so good that I was picked up by a professional team, she was still stuck on a relatively high rank but nothing near me, which made her mad.

At first she thought it was cool because she liked to show me off, but after so much attention that I was receiving she told me she was going to get a higher rank than me and put me in my place. I loved that side of her even if she could be borderline abusive, don't judge me.

When she failed to do so she got very frustrated and our relationship got very bad, she wouldn't even talk about the game anymore until she asked me for help, finally, and I thought that it would be good for herself to regain some confidence and having her leading me in game had a nice feeling, but I only came to realize how much better I was already, and when we were losing she would become mad and talk shit to the team, even to me.

So one day I had enough and told her a lot of shit that I thought but never said, and well, we had a huge fight and she became kind of abusive after that, and then all of our friends told me that I am an asshole for that, so I accepted it, apologized the best that I could, sucked it up while playing with her and kept letting her be just like that until she finally got over it and became a nice, caring girlfriend again.

We are still together and we still play together from time to time, and after that I have never seen her being toxic or being so frustrated, so I feel like I was the asshole because I couldn't understand her feelings and only felt that she was being unfair to me, so it wasn't fair to say those things to her while she was vulnerable, and while I already told her this, she told me that she was actually the asshole for not acknowledging me and taking her frustration out on me and other people, so she had it coming.

AITA for using the money I won in a lottery to finance my own dream vacation across Europe/Asia besides on my kid’s student loan debt?,"On my birthday this year, I treated myself to 50 bucks in lottery tickets, and managed to hit one of the huge $50,000 payouts. After taxes, I had ~$34,000, so I’ve put $7,500 into my wife’s car, and put the rest into a high-interest bank account. I’m planning to switch jobs early 2020, but first, I plan to travel for the month of January and half of February across Asia and Europe. I’ve never had a proper vacation (unless you count weekend trips to Disney World for the kids) and have really wanted to take the chance to go out there and explore the world.

Well yesterday my daughter Emily were talking about the job movement and the topic of the vacation came up. I told her about how I’m financing it with the lottery (she previously did not know about the winnings) and Emily went quiet before saying “instead of wasting 25 grand on a vacation, why not do something practical like maybe spend $5,000 on a vacation and help your daughter not graduate with mountain of debt”.

I told her that I’d be happy to co-sign loans for her, but I was only willing to pay upwards of $10,000 of her education (the amount I promised both her and her brother when they were 13-15). She said even after paying that off, she’s looking to be at being $29,000 in debt by the time she finishes school. 

I told her that really sucks, but reminded her that I offered community college as an option years ago when she was applying to schools, but she insisted that she didn’t want to “miss out on the prestige” (she got into Dartmouth). I talked to her about how transferring was an option, but she ultimately picked that route.

She’s brought up how the 10k I gave Jason (my son) was enough to completely pay for college cost + some extra spending change, because he got a state scholarship that paid for 100% tuition. She argued how it’s not fair that I was essentially willing to pay all of his college but leave her with a mountain of debt.

I told her that he’d be able to argue the same thing if she got more money than he did. Ultimately, the line I drew was that both children get equal amounts and I can choose how I want to spend my money, end of discussion.

I thought it was over but it turns out that she went and talked to my wife Amy about it behind my back. Amy tried to “persuade” me to make it a 2-3 week vacation as opposed to the 1.5 months I had planned. I told her the same thing that I told our daughter, and then SHE then got mad and said that I’m being selfish and using all of the money that for myself (nevermind the amount I put into *her* car AND the fact that she used ALL of a $5,000 inheritance on cosmetic plastic surgery 4 years back). I told her this vacation was non-negotiable.

Now I have two women in this household giving me passive aggressive looks and eyerolls. I feel like they’re both acting entitled to MY shit; am I really being unreasonable here?

AITA for not including my sister in a family photo?,"I (32F) got married 4 years ago. My younger sister (30F) didn’t attend because my wedding had a no children condition. At the time my other siblings (4 older brothers, 1 older sister) also had young kids but all of them attended my wedding. My younger sister was the only one who chose not to. Her son was 14 months old at the time. She didn’t want to leave him. I tried to accommodate by saying I could book a hotel room (I got married in a hotel ballroom) so that she could leave her son with her MIL in the hotel room and check on him regularly. Her MIL didn't mind, but my sister refused. I also offered to pay for a babysitter but that was shot down as well. She didn’t seem to want any option other than bringing her son to the wedding. She ended up not attending my wedding. My wedding went off without a hitch. Aside from her everyone else from my family was there. I even had cousins, uncles and aunts who travelled in from different countries to attend my wedding. 

After the wedding I went no contact with her. She tried to pretend like she didn’t skip the wedding and that our relationship would go back to normal. Obviously, it did not. The next three years we did not have any communication. Last year we reconciled after our dad begged us to. She apologized and said she was suffering from extreme anxiety and didn’t want to be away from her son. We buried the hatchet and moved on. 

Onto the issue: my husband and I are finally buying a house so I went and printed several of my wedding pictures to put up in the house. I printed a picture of my parents and siblings with my husband and I on our wedding day and framed it. It is going on our living room wall. My younger sister isn’t in the picture as she didn’t attend the wedding. She is upset because she was excluded in the picture. She wants me to photoshop her into the picture and I said no. If she wanted to be in the picture she should have made the effort to attend my wedding. I have already printed the pictures and don’t want to reprint. Adding her in by photoshop may compromise the quality of the pictures. Those are the reasons why I said no. She claims that I’m punishing her by doing this. I do have other pictures of her + our family that I’m intending to put up in the house, but my wedding pictures are my favorite and the “main"" attraction.

(he plays hunt showdown and I remember specifically during the Halloween event he was so excited to grind out games to get whatever it is you get at the end. he proceeds to say that I am connecting the two games as one, (using a wrong definition mind you as well) I say that I'm certain that hunt has grindy aspects to it just the same as almost any other game (grinding imo is doing repetitive tasks to get an item/title/etc you want/need) again more fighting, (i replied that he used the wrong definition for that word and what he actually meant was collate) he then tells me im wrong the definition is to bring together two ideas into one, which im not im comparing the games and contrasting them. we argue about certain things in the past and before i just let him win so he refers to that time about how he ""stomped"" my argument. i tell him that hes overreacting to me correcting him on a word and that he doesn't want to admit hunt can be grindy because it doesnt appeal to his original narrative. Steve says ""you're still on the collate thing i know you have a superiority complex but get off it"" which breaks past some of the shit he said, i told him hes being a dick for no reason arguing over fucking games. Steve then sends me a gif saying he doesn't care. i dm him personally telling him that  if you got a problem with me correcting the way you used certain words and get upset over me saying that most games are grindy unless you dont care about progressing anything in the game then idk dude. being a bit hypocritical in the discussion we had and using those terms as in squashed, buggin, superiority complex shit like that, yeah it radiates you being a dick. legit did not make fun of you once nor said shit like that till you talked about the superiority complex. if you truly think i have one . then imma be real i don't see a point in us remaining friends especially if you see me as THAT low. he responds saying he was not fighting, not fighting at all. and i told him i was taking a few days away from the chat. my other friends says im in the wrong, but who would want to be talked down upon, i asked my other friend (jim) jim said that he's the admin you can't punish him for being a dick but i see you're both wrong.

When I first moved in I notice my neighbor a few doors down from me would sometimes throw parties over the long weekend and I was like, no biggie - it's the long weekend. I can tolerate noise until late in the night on the rare occasion

But as the years went on, these guys started to throw more and more parties that would go until very late at night. I'm talking like, 2am. Even if I don't have work the next day doesn't mean I want to be kept up by it and it also doesn't mean others don't 

The dad of this family also has this old school car that he only drives up and down the street in weekends and it's LOUD! 

I'm really sick of this family. They have very little regard for anyone around them besides themselves. They are selfish and absolute d***heads. I hate their stupid faces and all the parties their son throws. Our street is overrun by other people's cars who take my parking spot

I had enough and decided to write an anonymous letter basically stating how horrible they are as human beings. No one likes to hear them at 2am in the morning, no one likes your shitty music, no one likes the sound of your stupid car going up and down the street and overall, can you just stop being such a god damn asshole and think about your neighbors.

For context, when we moved in together, I had already trained and partially raised the dog we have now (aka got her before we met). So I understand how he can feel, this is not his dog, but I honestly think it is. He’s emotionally investing himself in this dog and lives with her. 

He is saying… if we get a second dog, he gets to pick the breed, gender, training habits, etc all on his own terms only… because “he didn’t get to choose with the first one”.

So hypothetically, say we get this second dog; I am investing in raising a whole new puppy in our home, cleaning up when there’s messes made… obviously I’m not going to just wait for him to clean “his dogs mess”. It’s our dogs that we are raising.

AITA for not carriyng my weight in the group project while dealing with a family health crisis?,"On the March 9, I found out that my brother, a doctor, tested positive for coronavirus. This was scarybecause everyone that was exposed to him had something to worry about, especially my parents. He was admitted to the hospital that same day.

Back at home, all of us were under stress: we were all worrying about my brother's condition, while worrying about the health of my parents and each other. My parents who are also doctors would make phone calls every hour, and my sister and I would listen in to get updates and talk about my brother's situation. My mother also started having us pray as a family a lot more. This took up a lot of my time. I'd also started feeling some symptoms like a sore throat and body pains.

I'm a student working on a big project with two others. At the beginning, I told them that I would be a bit MIA considering everything that was happening with my brother. They were understanding back then and would let me listen in on meeting when I wasn't feeling myself. I would type in chat while we were on voice and they would respond to me - I was doing my best to contribute to the discussion.

As my brother's condition worsened the time with my family increased. On the 23rd, my brother was taken to the ICU to be intubated. He was in critical condition. My family made the decision to go to our one bedroom apartment, close to where my brother was hospitalized.

We're five people staying here, implying that I have almost no privacy and no space to focus on work. Adding to that, it's as if we get more and more bad news every day. I'm listening in on phone calls constantly. We talk to so many doctors daily, and I also have to entertain phone calls from family asking how my brother is.

When I try to get work or studying done, I'm interrupted. I've told my family that my work is important to me, they told me that I need to be flexible because of the situation. My older sister has even told me to stop studying. I spend hours a day doing things for the family, talking about my brother's condition, praying - all the work time I had prior to this was cut down.

One of my friends (Let’s call them Avery) brought up a conflict in a server they're in with some of their other friends (Let’s call one of these friends Jay). Jay had shared a copypasta about leaving the server due to feeling left out. This made everyone on that server panic, so Avery came to me to ask about what they should do (Jay said they’d leave because of the server’s “toxic” atmosphere, and I cannot speak for them on this as I’m not a part of the server, but I suspect it might be another lie due to Avery saying repeatedly and recently that everyone is superbly nice)

Later, Jay spoke up and said it was all a lie. Avery relayed this information to me and who we’ll call Jake. Avery said another person asked Jay if it was legit, and they said it was faked. I suggested the mods on the server maybe kick that person out for that (This is where I suspect I could be seen as the a-hole here, and I understand that)

Jake supported me while telling Avery about my personal opinion on the matter. But Avery says I might have been overreacting, and I understand why they’d said that, but I also don’t think I am.

But when I can smell something with really strong odors it tends to make me nauseous (this is important). 

The woman is in her cutting phase right now and shes kinda...smelly. Like it honestly smells like a mixture of rotten eggs and what I like to call broccoli farts. I don’t think it’s body odor because I can’t usually smell that unless I’m right up on people and I don’t think it’s her eating at her desk because she’s a loud eater and I haven’t heard her eating. 

I think she’s letting out silent farts because she always gets up to go to the restroom after. And like I said this usually doesn’t bother me because I can smell most things. But this smell is so bad that it’s making me gag and cover up my face. 

I don’t want to embarrass her but WIBTA if I got a air freshener for my desk and sprayed it whenever I smell the broccoli farts?",No A-holes here
AITA for not moving out with my girlfriend?,"Hey everyone! My girlfriend and I both recently turned 22, and we've been together for five years now. She had a taste of living on her own during a college program a few years ago, and ever since she got back, she's been ready to move out and start her life.

We've been going back and forth about moving out since. She wants to move out, and I don't. I say I'm not ready because I still feel like 22 is relatively young, and I can save up for at least another year! I just don't see the big rush. I think it would benefit us both to wait.

I also bring up that I shouldn't be pressured into something huge like this. If I say no, then it should mean no. She says that that's not fair to her because I'm not taking what she says into consideration .. but that's a really big decision. I would never go through with something she's not comfortable with! She thinks I'm holding her back, and today I told her that I'm not stopping her from moving out. If she wants to, go ahead, but I'm not coming. That's why I don't feel like I'm not holding her back or anything.

To her point though, we both work full time with solid jobs, and we both know we want to get married. Honestly, she's the perfect girl for me! I look forward to starting a life with her! When we fight about this, she brings up those two points, and all I can really say that I want to save up and I'm not ready yet. I understand where she is coming from, that's why I'm not sure if I'm the a-hole in this situation.

However today, this argument was a lot different. We started talking about the same stuff I wrote above, but the conversation shifted. She then said that she's been waiting for me to propose to her for a long time now. We have a vacation booked, and she was expecting me to propose to her then.

This came out of nowhere, we were talking about moving out! She started getting really emotional and said that it would make her happy if I ""at least"" proposed to her on the trip. When I said I'm not doing that, she got angry with me. She said that I could make her happy if she had something to plan and think about until we move out. And all this didn't really make sense to me.

She ended up giving me an ultimatum without saying it. Either I move out with her, or propose to her. That way she can be happy moved out, or she can be happy because she knows she's getting married soon. And I don't want to do either thing (yet).

I was very upset at this point, but I kept my cool. I explained to her that I really am excited to start my life with her, and she really is the best thing that's ever happened to me! I really want to do all these things, but I just feel it's too early. Why not save up? What's the rush? We can make life so much easier if we just wait another year!

I then looked at the time and realized I was almost late for work, so I left, and I'm still here now. She's very upset with me, and I'm just sad. All this came out of nowhere. 

I'm not sure if I'm the a-hole here. So any feedback would be appreciated.",No A-holes here

AITA for being annoyed with my father in law for wanting to cook the Thanksgiving Turkey?,"I just want to preface by saying that my father-in-law is a very sweet man with a good heart and he does a lot for my husband and I....

This year my husband and I are hosting Thanksgiving at our house for 17 people.  My father in law (who does not live with us) got a very large free Turkey and decided to that he will be cooking the Turkey for our gathering. I work full time and have a toddler so I am grateful for this.  And while I think this is a nice gesture on his part, I am a little worried because he wants to cook the Turkey the day before Thanksgiving (to get it out of the way), and then reheat it in the oven Thanksgiving day. He can cook but does not salt his food very much. This is an incredibly nice thing of him to do for us but I feel slightly insulted as the hostess that he didn't even ask if I was ok with it. But then again  I also FEEL like an a-hole because it will take a great burden/stress off of me to not have to deal with the Turkey and only the sides. I am trying to persuade my husband to get FIL to cook the bird on actual a Thanksgiving (we are eating in the evening so he has a lot of time to do so) but he's pretty set in his ways about it...

AITA for shooing a family of chickens out of the road?,"I feel as if I was the A-hole here but, I just want to know what others think. 

So I was with my sister in this one parking lot that had a bunch of wild chickens. We were taking pictures of them and heard yelling from across the street. An old man was shouting at us to leave them alone and that was when I finally noticed how close the family of chickens were to the road. They were by the bushes but a few chicks were directly in the road. If a car came by it would surely hit them. I feel kind of stupid for doing this but, I jogged over trying not to scare them further into the road. During this time the old man kept yelling at me. I shooed the family of chicks away and they got safely into the bushes.

AITA for not wanting to give my friend my number?,"Okay, I know that this isn’t on the more extreme side of this subreddit, but I still need to know if I’m the A-hole here.

For some context, for many years it’s just been me and my best friend. We have tons of things in common and we’re inseparable. I was never opposed to having more friends but that never really happened. Her and I message each other after school (not constantly) but we don’t really bring it up in real life.

Onto the rest of it. Recently someone else just kind of forced their way into our friendship. It’s not that I dislike them for that, but their overall vibe and personality is what makes me dislike them. Sometimes it’s fine, the day goes on nicely, no problem. Other times not so much. We don’t argue or fight but I still get put off by everything.

I’ve dealt with it so far and I won’t have to see her again at the end of the year, so it’s cool, I’ll just put up with it and then it’ll all be over.

Until recently she started bugging me for a phone number to message me when we’re not together in real life. I usually joke about it a bit and it naturally moves into another topic, but I know I can’t avoid it forever. I honestly can’t tell if I’m the A-hole here or not. So, tell me, Reddit.

AITA for not paying my other employees as much as my developers in my small business?,"I started a small business with 3 other software engineers 10 years ago and now we’ve grown into a 50+ employee company. Our old accountant quit because she was unhappy about not getting the raise she wanted and on her way out leaked everyone’s salaries through an email. We have about 30 SWEs and the rest are QAs and employees who handle the business/sales sides of things. All our devs are payed like 2x-4x times everyone else’s salaries which I think is pretty par for the course. Our lowest paid employee still makes 50k which is above average for their role in our area - we’re Midwestern based. 

The leaked email has created a tense and awkward atmosphere at the workplace. Some employees have expressed concerns over the wage discrepancies during our one-on-ones. I’ve maintained that nothing is going to change since the email leak and I am looking into legal action against our ex employee who leaked it but am wondering if I’m the a’hole here.

AITA for not wanting to attend the wedding of my boyfriend’s friend?,"I guess no one is really an a*hole here, but I’m looking for perspective on who’s in the wrong here.

So, a little background: My boyfriend (M27) and I (18F) have been together for two years. We’re in a distance relationship (he lives in Prague, Czechia and I’m studying in Switzerland), so we see each other once every 4-5 weeks, and I usually travel the 7 hours because he has his own apartment and I didn’t have my own until recently.

I’ll be done with my exam period in 3 weeks and then I’ll visit him for a week and a half. Today he announced to me that his friend is getting married on the 12th of February, the only weekend we have together (and he’ll be at work during the week). Alright, I’m not thrilled but it’s an important event for him and I’d never keep him from attending. However, 1. The wedding is somewhere in the countryside and we’d have to rent a car for the 8 hour round trip. I’m not thrilled about this because it’s one day after I traveled 7 hours for us to meet.
2. I don’t know a single person there, which seems like it will be a bit strange. I also speak don’t speak their dialect of Czech and will be the only “outsider” there.
For these two reasons I told him I don’t really want to attend and I’ll happily stay home while he goes. He seemed quite unhappy and disappointed and gave me the silent treatment for a while. 

It sucks because it’s one of our three full days together that’s kind of wasted. But driving for 8 hours and then going to some stranger’s wedding is not what I envisioned after not seeing each other for over a month and a half :/",No A-holes here
AITA for not congratulating a pregnant friend?,"Not going to be very long here...my wife and I had our first child last August. We were lucky enough to have our insurance completely cover a certain genetic test that would allow us to find out the gender extremely early so we decided to have a gender reveal party (cliche, I know...). Well we invited a lot of friends and family to this, but one friend in particular said she wouldn't come because she was having trouble getting pregnant and that it was hard for her to be happy for us given her circumstances...no big deal right?...Fast forward to now...she is pregnant and all of a sudden wants everyone to be happy for her and wants to talk all the time about her child and expects everyone to be happy for her. Maybe I'm a spiteful A*hole but I'm having a tough time being happy for her.  AITA?

Edit: Maybe I should have included a few small details. 1) I haven't congratulated her *YET* ...I fully intend to.
2) We struggled to get pregnant as well. So I fully sympathize with infertility.

AITA for accidentally saying something slightly racist about a K-Pop band?,"First off, I'm definitely not implying that anyone else would be the AH in this situation so it's kind of YTA vs. NAH...

I (18F) recently finished my first year of University and made a new friend group with two Indian girls and an Indian guy. Both of the girls really like BTS, and one of them has a poster of them on her wall. I'm not interested in BTS for two reasons: a) I like to know all the lyrics and sing along in my head when I listen to music so I only listen to music in English (yeah I know parts of a lot of their songs have some English but I also don't really like those lyrics) and b) I'm usually not a fan of pop in general.

We were in the girl with the poster's room and talking about BTS. At one point we were talking about the poster and she asked me who I thought was the hottest. I looked at the poster for a couple seconds, and without thinking I said ""They all look the same"". Instantly regretted it. I know this is a very common stereotype for east Asian people and I really don't want to be contributing to it (I am white). I could tell by the look on their faces I'd said something lowkey offensive but as I told them, I'd never seen BTS other than this poster and I'm not that good with faces.

Edit: When I say not that good with faces, I mean reallyyy bad with faces. I work in a deli and very regularly have people order sliced meat and step away, and 30 seconds later I'll forget what they looked like and who tf this meat is for.

AITA for refusing to move out of my parents’ house with my best friend?,"So this isn’t like a big tea spill, but I just really feel like a huge a**hole for doing this, so I wanted some opinions.

I went to community college for a term, right before the pandemic began, and I made an awesome friend. She was cool and we did a lot together. I didn’t have a job at the time because my parents insisted I should focus on classes instead of a job. But me and my friend talked about moving out of our parents’ house all the time. It was something we really wanted to do together after we got jobs and after I got my license (she won’t be able to drive due to a joint disability; she’s decided it’s not worth the risks).

And then COVID happened.

Just as I was about to get my license, the DMV shut down. I was so upset. This threw a BIG hitch into my plans to get out of the house. I’d have to wait until the pandemic thing blew over and the DMV opened again. I skipped the next term, as it was all online and I’m not good with online classes, but I stayed in contact with my friend. We even hung out sometimes (we waited until we’d been isolated for about a month and didn’t leave the house at all, and we still tried to use social distancing whenever possible). The dream of moving out together seemed far off.

Then things started opening up again. HUZZAH! The DMV opened and I tried to schedule an appointment. But the DMV wasn’t doing drive tests. They called me to tell me they wouldn't be doing a drive test for a new, non-commercial license. I was even more upset than before. I’m still mad just thinking about it. I’m a very independent person, and I wanted to be responsible for myself entirely. My friend wasn’t super happy about this either, though it didn’t affect her quite so directly. We just agreed we’d wait even longer to move out.

Meanwhile, I got a job! That was the best thing I could do to bring myself closer to moving out. I immediately started saving money, making sure I only spent money when necessary. My bank account was slowly but surely growing in amount and I was excited. First I could afford a car, and then, after I got my license and got myself to a financially stable point, I could move out!

Today, she texted me saying she couldn’t wait anymore. She needed out. Now. I was immediately hesitant. I told her I couldn’t as I didn’t have my license or a car or even really enough money saved up to last us very long. She said she got a job though! She made 1200 a month! She had food stamps! Surely, we could do it. I just...couldn’t budge. Without a way to get to work, we would have to move back almost immediately. I wanted to be smart about this.

I feel so guilty. She constantly feels like an outcast in her own home. I know she won’t tell me, but I KNOW she’s upset. Her reaction made that clear. Of course, I’d *love* to move out with her, but the timing is all bad. Am I just being a bad friend? Am I the a**hole here?",No A-holes here

AITA For telling a friend to not call me anymore,"I feel like a real A hole here.

I've got this friend I've known for the better part of my life, I'm 18 and they about a couple years older. About five years ago he moved city and we lost all contact for awhile. But about a year ago they started calling me and wanted to talk. They had a tough time in school and never found a solid job. I'm sure they felt lonely and just wanted someone to talk to. What started happening is that they talked about subjects like anime and video games, stuff I'm not very interested in.

The calls felt one sided and I'd had enough after awhile and started making up excuses for them to not call me. They cought onto it after some time though and started asking question about why I did not want to talk. I avoided those conversations as well for awhile because I did not want to make them feel bad for telling them off.

When they after months of me avoiding it approched me about it I told them how I felt. I said I had no interest in the calls and that I had more important things to focus on, I've just started my first full time job. I made it clear it was nothing personal but they took it very poorly and have not heard from them anymore.

What makes me feel like an A hole is that the last thing they said is that they saw me as a very close friend. I can only ponder on if I was their only friend and if they went through depression now. What else could I have done? I did not want to keep taking calls, but I might just have ruined them.

AITA for making a teenage girl weigh herself at the top of a waterslide?,"I work as a lifeguard at a waterpark and part of my job includes managing the top of the waterslides. I’m to make sure no one does anything dangerous like going face first, cramming too many people on one innertube, etc. I’m also instructed to ask anyone who looks like they could be over the weight limit–250 pounds–to weigh themselves on our scale, and deny them entry if they refuse. I’m not super comfortable with this, but it’s much better than risking people’s safety.

Here lies the problem: I lift weights, and for this reason I am very dense–I weigh 185 pounds but somehow wear a size 6. Most of my friends also lift and have similar body compositions to me. For this reason I have trouble estimating how much someone actually weighs.

This problem presented itself last weekend when an overweight teenage girl wanted to ride the slide. She most likely wasn’t over 250 pounds, but I couldn’t be certain. I’ve gotten better at estimating weights but my supervisor says if there’s any chance they’re over 250 to weigh them, so I approached her gently and asked her to please get on the scale. 

She met me with a snarky teenager attitude and said “what if I refuse?” She was with a group of teenagers, some of whom were giggling.

“Then you won’t be allowed on the slide,” I said matter-of-factly.

She rolled her eyes and got on the scale, and her weight wasn’t even close to 250 so I felt kind of bad. She then said “See?” and went along with her friends.

Although she gave me attitude I could tell she was embarrassed. Her face was red as she went back to her friends, who were all thin. I asked my supervisor how he would have handled the situation and he said I did the right thing, that it’s better to hurt someone’s feelings than break someone’s bones.

However, yesterday I was called into the office of the owner of the waterpark. She told me she received an angry email from a parent about how I embarrassed their child in front of her friends. I explained to her that I was just following protocol and she asked me how much the girl actually weighed. I gave her the answer and she laughed at me and told me I could never get a job as a weight guesser at a carnival and that I need to do my job better. My supervisor is backing me up and saying I was doing what he has required me to do. I’m thankful for his support but honestly this whole situation is making me feel like an a\*\*hole. I know teenage girls are a particularly vulnerable population, as I was a teenage girl not too long ago, and I could have possibly handled that situation with more care.

AITA for wanting what I think are normal updates from my wife?,"So this is probably an easy one compared to what you all are used to dealing with.

My wife and I have known each other for 20 years, dated for 7, been married for 2. We have a 16 month old daughter together and a great marriage generally speaking. As long as we have known each other, we trust each other without exception regarding things like infidelity, abuse, or any of the serious life altering bad decisions that can happen to a married couple. We have silly bickering type disagreements like I think most couples do but there is never yelling (as neither of us grew up in a home where that was common) and we prefer to talk about what went wrong and come to a mutual agreement as to how to keep it from happening again.

Anyways, there is this one issue that has been a recurring disagreement between us that I'm wondering if I'm being unreasonable and should let it go (being an a-hole for being frustrated when it happens) or if I'm justified in asking for.

The wife grew up in a home where once of age she was allowed to go out with friends, come home whenever, and her parents did not expect updates of any kind. I grew up with parents that also let me go out, but they wanted updates about where I was, who I was with, and when they could approximately expect me home.

Now I can't get updates about anything from her as my spouse. I have told her time and again that she is allowed to do what she wants, when she wants, and come home whenever you want. I'm your husband not your boss. All I want to know is where you are and when you think you'll be home. And when there's a change please let me know so I'm not home worrying about you. But it doesn't happen. Today she left town while I was at work (plans I was well aware of far in advance) but she did not tell me ""ok honey I'm getting on the road, love you, I'll let you know when I'm there safe"". She just left town and said nothing. And likely would not have said anything when she arrived. I say I deserve these minor updates. She says you knew I was leaving town days ago so why do I have to tell you again when I actually go?

An important part of this rant worth noting is that I'm an ex 911 operator/police dispatcher and I did that job for 10 years. I've heard the worst of tragedies and know how bad it can get... so from that anxiety stems my desire to know she's ok. We can track each other's locations through our phones for safety reasons and we have always been able to, but again, that's not for lack of trust, it's for safety concerns God forbid something bad happens. Short of me using it to meet her outside with the baby because she gets excited when Mommy gets home it's not something I ever check. 

TL;DR: AITA for expecting minor updates on wife's activities (""I'm leaving town now"", ""I got there ok"", ""girls night changed and I'll be home a little later""), or am I being unreasonable and I should ease up? Reasons for updates are safety concerns related, not based in trust problems.

Thank you for your help.

Edit: Can all this BS about how much of an AH I am because I chose to use this word ""allowed"" ease up a bit? The boyfriend before me was a bit controlling according to her... so me going out of my way to remind her that she is allowed to do whatever she wants makes me an AH? Just because she's allowed to do what she wants, doesn't necessarily mean I'M the one allowing it. She's ""allowed"" because she's a human adult, not because I deem it so. Most of you folks have offered some great advice that I did use towards a very productive talk we had together a bit ago. The rest of you screaming over a word choice need to go find your next nothing to scream about somewhere else... it isn't here. And as evidence of that, after reading my post and the upset people's responses about the word ""allowed""... she asked me to politely relay STFU to said people. She's never even needed me to defend her... let alone you upset for the sake of being upset rando's.

AITA for not insisting that someone finish a job they've already been paid for?,"MY (32F) grandmother recently decided to gift me and my husband a screen door for the house. We have a one year old, so she said this will add a sense of security. I am very appreciative. I see this as a really sweet gesture. 

So my grandmother paid for the screen door and she hired her neighbor/friend to install it. I think he works for construction or something. All was fine until it was time to install the door. He took over 4 hours and eventually my family and I had to go to sleep because it was getting too late and we had work in the morning. 

I appreciated the fact that he didn't want to give up on the project, but it was an obvious struggle for him. (I think I read online when ordering that the door should take about 30 mins to install.) I kept offering him help and asking if he needed anything but he refused. 

In the morning, we saw that the door was only partially installed. There was no handle from the inside, and it was locked, so we literally couldn't exit the front door. My husband had to go outside through the back and install the front handle so that we could simply open the front door. There were also visible holes where there shouldn't have been and it was not completely aligned. 

So here is the issue. My grandma asked how it looked and I told her the truth. It isn't finished. She is insisting that he come and finish the job since she already paid him. I am pretty adamant about just hiring someone else (and I'll pay for that with my own money of course). I don't see the point in her neighbor coming back if he is incapable of doing the job. It will just prolong the process and likely be frustrating for everyone involved. 

AITA for telling my grandma that I'll just hire someone myself to finish the job? Thanks for any advice. My grandma is the sweetest in the world and I don't want to hurt her feelings. But I also think she was trying to be sweet to this guy by hiring him and encouraging him to take on a job that he may not be comfortable with.

AITA for suggesting my fiancé get therapy after he had a breakdown while trying to fix the shower?,"So I (F35) have been with my fiancé (M41) for quite a while now, more than 6 years. 

We both come with some emotional baggage. I am an anxious person and I am still dealing with some trauma. He had an abusive family member and spent a lot of his youth very poor. Still, over the years, we have worked on our issues and our relationship has become stronger for it. I have done my best to learn some coping skills from free resources on the Internet to manage better. However, my fiancé acknowledges that his past messed him up but is against any sort of professional help. Even talking to me was hard at first. I am saying this because while therapy is available in my country, it's still taboo, you're considered ""crazy"" if you go to therapy. I'm no professional so I mess up and I think I made things worse here, so I am wondering if I am the AH.

Tonight was date night. I went out to walk our dog and he set out to clean the bathroom and get ready. I got home and as soon as I entered, I heard this horrible keening from the bathroom. It was my fiancé crying. I called for him and all I heard was more sobbing. I went there to see what was up and I found him standing next to the shower, crying his eyes out, various tools strewn across the bathroom floor. He was holding his hands out like they were contaminated and they really were covered in some foul-smelling substance.

I tried to do my best to calm him down enough to learn what happened. Between sobs, he told me how he went to take a shower but realized that there was an issue with the shower handle for the cold water tap. So he tried to disassemble it and fix it. He used a screwdriver, then pliers, one thing led to another, and he ended up *using a hammer to try and put a bolt back in*. He missed and managed to make several holes in the tiles on the wall. So he panicked and tried to fill the holes with silicone caulk, didn't use any gloves, and got it all over his hands and most of his tools. This sent him into the state in which I found him – alone, crying and wailing about how he ruins everything.

I didn't blame him or get mad. I cleaned his hands with acetone and we cleaned the tools and the bath. There are holes in the wall and we need to use pliers to turn the cold water tap but I am honestly worried about him, not the wall. This isn't the first time he's tried to fix things, failed, made it worse, then got upset. So I sat him down to talk and suggested that there is a deeper issue here and that he needs to maybe talk to a professional about it (and actually learn how to fix the things he wants to fix instead of just doing stuff). I reminded him that if I had the same approach to cooking, we wouldn't have nice meals. I keep telling him that it's a pattern and that he needs help. This has distressed him even more and now he's gone to bed early, sad and blaming himself. So, AITA?",No A-holes here
AITAH for not telling my fiancé he was a “ rebound”,Before I start rebound wasn’t my word it just what was said and I’m trying to hi light the issue!When I was 17 I got out of an insanely bad relationship with someone who was much older then me and like 10 years older. I went to Florida with my friends for spring break and I met my now fiancé. When I met him want interested in a serious relationship or one at all. But all my friends though this new guy would be a good distraction. We exchanged number and spent 6 days in Florida together before returning home. Pretty soon we started a relationship and we’d fly out to see each other all the time and became quite committed he started law school and I started my master’s program in Orlando where he has always live  and now we  live together. Anyway- I never cared to mention that I got into a relationship with him less then 3 weeks after my last one ended I was hurt and  didn’t want to revisit the issue. My fiancé and I were in North Carolina (where I’m from) for a week for a friend’s wedding where the conversation or relationships started and one of my friends said “ he did pretty for just a rebound “  i live him more then anything in life I never saw our relationship as a rebound he just happened to come into my life at a pretty bad point. He told me how that was to him and how he just wished I would’ve shared it with him. He’s been sleeping at his parents house because he feels like I always viewed him as a way to get over my ex. We were 17 and 18 when we started dating and now we’re 25 and 26. Engaged for about a year and are 10 weeks away from our wedding. Am I the ass hole here ?,No A-holes here
AITA For Not Wanting My Boyfriend to Live With My Parents?,"My boyfriend (19M) and I (20F) have been dating for about three years and we've been making plans to get married and get our own place. (I currently live with his grandparents, and him with his parents.) Life happened and we've been struggling to get there and due to medical reasons I've been debating moving back in with my parents for my safety. My boyfriend was a little hesitant with it as I moved out to escape a toxic household but has come to the conclusion it's necessary for my physical health considering his grandparents aren't home when I am and they don't have the ability to help me medically if necessary.

After coming to this agreement I went to talk to my parents as they had offered a place for me to come back to since I was having these medical issues, my mom (45F) even offered to help pay for a service dog as it was recommended by not only my doctor, but my therapist and psychiatrist. When I went over to discuss coming back, my dad (45M) pulled me aside and had a long conversation about how he felt that they should be helping my boyfriend out of his toxic situation. I completely agree that my boyfriend has a horrible living situation and I want him out of there too, but my dad said he'd be taking the room that was offered to me. I told him I was planning on moving back in, due to my medical problems, but he said he figured I'd be okay since I was ""getting help"".

I was really frustrated and told my boyfriend about the situation. He was baffled and said, ""As much as I want out and as great as an offer that is, you need it more right now."" And left it at that. He told me to tell my parents that he respectfully declines their offer, but I could tell he was at least a little bummed at not being able to leave. When I told my parents they told me they wanted to talk to him about it so I should ask him to come over. I told them that I didn't want to be a middle man for them and they should talk to them himself. They then told me they didn't want to make him feel like they were overstepping and I haven't really talked to them about it since.

It recently came up in conversation with a friend of mine and they called me and a**hole for guilting my boyfriend with my problems, and I should let him go live in a safe place where it was more affordable for him to save money. I tried to explain how I physically can't work right now because of my health problems but they said work didn't matter since my current rent was cheaper than his current rent, and he couldn't afford basic medical help due to the crazy amount of rent his parents charge. I never physically told him he couldn't move in with my parents (it's not my decision anyway), and I won't stop him if he wants to (even though I would prefer if he didn't), but he told me he doesn't want to. AITA here?

EDIT: We can't move in together right now due to money, and parents won't let us live with them together unless we're married. Religion plays a part in the situation, but it isn't the big issue right now. His grandparents don't want him moving in with them due to wanting him to serve a religious mission.

"AITA for ""underfeeding"" my brother's new dog?","That title was intended to make me look like the bad guy here, but let me explain. My(21m) brother(26m) got a new dog. It was rescued by couple who apparently got told by the local authorities that they had rescued too many, and had to give some away. The one he got was a 6mo that seems to have some separation anxiety, and was, and still is, underweight. My brother had to go to another state for some job training, and left Luna (his dog) with me and my parents for a week. While he was here, he told us exactly how to take care of her. Since she is underweight, he has been feeding her slightly more than the recommended amount; 2 cups in the morning and 3 at night(the recommended amount for what she should weigh at 1yo) to be precise. However, he said he was eye-balling her servings, and when we brought out a measuring cup to make sure(since I absolutely SUCK at estimation), we found out that he was underestimating the size of a cup. What he thought was 3 cups turned out to be just 2 cups, so he was giving her something like 1 & 1/3 cups in the morning and 2 cups at night. I decided to just give her 2 cups in the morning and evening, since it was technically more than what she had been getting, but when I texted my brother, he got extremely upset, since the point was for the dog to gain some much needed weight, so she should be getting 5 cups of food a day. I understand that I messed up, but was I actually an a-hole for it, considering the dog was getting more food than she was before?

P.s. I have already agreed to give the dog the 5 cups he asked for.",No A-holes here
AITA for flying home with my baby (4 months) and without my partner after my partners recent ICU stay? ...leaving him to continue rehab without me and his son for 3 weeks.,"
My partner has just come out of hospital after a 2 week stay in intensive care. We were visiting his family abroad (staying at his mums) when he became unwell. We have been here almost a month now when we only planned on two weeks.

I have an almost 4 month old son who is exclusively breastfed so very much dependant on me. We were also unwell during this visit, which was frightening, exhausting and expensive as we needed some medical care. He is also having some sort of sleep regression so I'm only getting 1.5hr stretches of sleep at a time.

Every day I went to the ICU for two hours (between feeds) to do some of my partners personal care as he didn't let the nurses do it. This involved feeding my son in the hospital, rushing to ICU, donning protective clothing, tending to and reassuring my partner, then rushing back out when my baby began crying with his grandma. It was exhausting mentally and physically as I was still recovering myself, eating poorly through worry, breastfeeding and extremely hot on the ICU. 

My partner is home now here and I think I might now be an arsehole as I've made the decision to fly home with my son on the 26th December. My partner cannot fly yet, drs orders. I'm sure my partner would like me to stay but I'm mentally and physically exhausted by these last few weeks full of worry, illness, sleep deprivation, back and forthing to the ICU and caring for my son single handed in a foreign country...in my partners mums home. 

My partner will be here for an extra 3 weeks possibly longer undergoing rehab. I know he has missed me and his son while in hospital and it's been a scary experience all round. My son needs some medicine (not available here) and his second set of jabs in our home country which is part of the reason why I want to go home. But in all honestly I'm want home because I've been exhausted, scared and homesick...and now wondering if I'm a total A-hole for booking this flight.

Info: it's not a foreign country to my partner. It's his country of birth where the majority of his friends and family are. It's also where his long term Dr is.",No A-holes here
AITA for using Saturday to study and leaving kids with husband?,"I am married (18 yrs) to my husband and we have three kids. The older kids have special needs (neurodivergent) and the youngest is a preschooler. I have been a stay-at-home mom until a year and a half ago when I went back to university to get my Masters degree. My husband got his before we had kids. 

During the workweek, he leaves in the morning right as the kids are getting ready for school. Typically, he gets home after they are in bed. He has every other Friday off, in addition to every weekend. I am a full-time student, and am doing my internship at an agency about 20 hours a week or so. The kids get home by 2pm and I am with them. So all of my stuff needs to be done when they are in school. In addition to almost all the things I did as a SAHM. My husband now does his and the kids laundry and sometimes the dishes or the like. 

This Saturday (like most) I am holed up in my office, working on a very difficult class. The class is online, and the due dates are Saturdays and Sundays. I can't study when the kids are at home, at all. And I can't study when I am doing internship.

So, with all that backstory, here is my problem: Two weeks ago I went to a matinee movie with my best friend (A Man Called Otto, it's so good!). Today, my husband says that it's not fair because he doesn't have any friends (he's not social) and he wants to go see a movie today. This is the first time he's mentioned it. I said that I need to study. He feels that he's held to a different standard, since he can't go out. I am totally open to him going to a movie, but not this afternoon because I need to work. He feels that he never gets a break, but I did. I said that he has the whole weekend where he doesn't have to work. He said that he has to be with the kids, so it doesn't count. I feel like this is unfair, but I can't articulate why and I am wondering if I am totally wrong. Our kids are pretty challenging, but I feel that they are easier on the weekend, when they aren't stressed out by school.",No A-holes here
AITA for preventing my dad from going to a restaurant?,"My dad [54] had a major heart attack last year in November. It was major enough that a hole ended up forming in his heart, and the doctors at the time gave him a slim chance of surviving. Well, my dad did, thankfully, but still has one blockage that needs to be looked at. He is home now recovering physically from the ordeal. 

As expected, the doctors put him on a strict diet. He has to avoid foods that evolve too much sodium, fat, sugar, etc. Basically, all the bad stuff. The doctors gave him a limit as to how much he could have a day, as well as gave him only one cheat day a week. This has been affecting my dad as he loves food. For reference, he used to be a smoker before his heart attack. But after his surgery and everything, he no longer desires a cigarette. But he says he doesn't miss it, but he says one thing that he does miss is food.

Here is the issue. He mentioned to me that he wanted to go to Waffle House so he could have something other than cereal. I was hesitant, even though he said that he would order eggs, grits, and toast. I thought that if he ordered, then he might surprise me and get hash browns or something. So I told my stepmother that he wanted to go as she had a more say in the matter. She said that he could, but he would have to tell the waiter to avoid putting butter on the toast and grits (she believes they automatically put butter on things while cooking). This discouraged my dad, and now he no longer wants to go to Waffle House. 

I knew this would happen, which was why I told my stepmother. My dad tells me that I shouldn't have told my stepmother anything. Said that I should have kept it a secret and that maybe he could live a normal life. He mentions how he feels like my stepmother and I are controlling him too much and not allowing him to choose for his own. He says that we are in the wrong for that. 

My dad loves food. Begs for Whoppers and BigMacs, but...the doctors put him on a strict diet for now. I just don't want to lose my dad. I already lost my stepfather and grandfather last year, and I don't want to lose another. I know he will eat whatever he wants once he is clear to drive. We won't be able to stop him then... but for now, I want to keep tabs on it. Especially since he still has a blockage. But what he says makes sense. Technically, we can't stop him from doing what he wants. If he wants to eat unhealthy foods and potentially risk his life once more, then he can. After all, that's his choice. But I want to keep him around.",No A-holes here
WIBTA for getting rid of ExBf Coy Fish?,"My ex (M 39) and I (F 43) had been together for 9yrs. We have 2 children (7 & 5) and have lived together for a little over 7yrs. 4 yrs ago I bought a house and it is in my name only. He was bitter and upset about it, but we were not married and his credit was not good enough to be on the loan. So everything with the house is in my name. I was married before and have absolutely no desire to get married again. We had been having issues in our relationship for about a 1yr and everything came to a head right around Thanksgiving 2022 and after a brief separation (\~2wks) I could tell nothing was going to get resolved and told him I was ending the relationship. He still wants to work on the relationship & is still trying to convince me to get back together. I have told him No repeatedly & he needs to make plans to get his things. There is a shed in the backyard I told him I would store his things & he could come to pick them up once he got a place & got them settled.

Now about the fish, about 2yrs ago he built a pond in the backyard and a neighbor gave him 17 fairly large Koi fish. These are not fish someone can put in a fish tank and keep inside and he has added more fish over the last couple yrs. There are still 15 large Koi and bunch of smaller fish. The pond has required a lot of upkeep and maintenance that he mostly took care of. I would help feed the fish occasionally, but for the most part, I wanted nothing to do with it. Now that we are split up and I have asked him several times what the plan for the fish & his things is & he never gives me an answer. He just keeps saying he wants to get back together. This is not going to happen & I have made that clear to him.

Well, it's starting to warm up here and I can tell the pump needs to be fixed again bc it is barely moving any water and the pond water is turning green already. I have been feeding the fish every few days, but that is the extent of my knowledge of caring for the fish and the pond. I do not have the time or money to figure out what needs to be done, so I found a fish/pond guy in our area and told my ex the guy was coming to look at the fish in the next 2 wks & he was probably going to take the fish & I would fill in the hole for the pond. He flipped out & said he wanted the fish & that I can't just get rid of his things. It has been over 45 days since we split and he has made absolutely no plans to pick up any of things or told me any plans for the fish.

So I told my ex he has until the fish/pond guy comes to get the fish, otherwise, I'm going to let him take them. He is LIVID & saying I can't expect him to find something to do with all these fish in a rental. He's saying I'm heartless and all the stuffs, but I really don't want to let these fish suffer bc of my lack of knowledge/experience/money/time/etc. I told him I don't want to deal with the pond/fish upkeep/maintenance and if hasn't picked them up before the other guy comes, he can have them.

AITA for moving in with my boyfriends parents and now wanting to leave?,"Hello, 

My boyfriend and I got jobs in a new city at the end of last year, and we were in a poor way financially so found it difficult when looking at places to rent. His family live a 2 hour commute away so he suggested we stay there and try to make it work, that way our finances will be in much better shape and we don't have to pay extortionate rents in work city. I was apprehensive at first and initially said no, and I was willing to work our way out of the financial hole whilst renting. However, after talking about it some more I agreed to try it out. 

We have been living here for a couple of months now, and I'm finding it really difficult for the following reasons: 

1. The commute - 2 hours in the morning and 2 hours at night. We share the drive so the burden isn't as heavy, but I feel as though my life is spent either at work or in the car. I'm also concerned for the longevity of my car as we're doing 1400 miles a month just commuting to work, and I really can't afford to get a new car if mine breaks.

2. Time - because the commute is so long, I feel like I have no time outside of work to do anything except cook and shower, and this is really taking its toll on my mental health. I was also really excited to live in and explore a new city, maybe pick up a new hobby and meet some new friends, but I don't get to do any of that, and I think a healthy life should include a good mix of work/hobbies/socialising. It's also affecting my other relationships. My sister and I are very close and talk all the time, but she's commented on how she never speaks to me anymore and when we do talk I'm so exhausted that our conversations are very short

3. Home life - his family are very nice and have been very very welcoming, but it can be a hostile environment which has left me feeling like I am walking on eggshells. This doesn't affect my partner as much as this is his home and his family, but I'm very aware that this is not my home and I try to make my presence as little known as possible which is uncomfortable. 

As much as I want to leave, I feel really selfish for fighting the case for us both to leave because he has financial goals he wants to work towards, and if we rent in work city, they become pretty much unachievable. I've suggested a compromise of I rent a room in work city and he can stay a few nights a week, but then I would have to take my car, leaving him with no way of getting to work, a d I like to think we're a team doing this together, and I feel as though I'll be abandoning him and leaving all the burden on him with the long commuting days, because I know it takes a toll on him too. 

I don't know if I'm just being too soft, obviously I care very much about this person and feel guilty for wanting to leave this burden solely on their shoulders, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep doing this without feeling like a shell of myself.

AITA for getting angry at my friend.,"Throw away as my friends know my real account, English is my first language and I'm on computer, so all mistakes are my fault.  

I just had a fight with a friend and wanted to check if I am in the wrong.

So, my friends Lenda, Rachel, Trisha, and I were playing a game. We have always been very silly in said game and not taken things super seriously.  In one round I ran out of things to do and decided to pull a small prank. I was setting things up and had not even pulled it off and ended up chickening out.

Lenda got really angry at me for a part of the set up and for a second game in a row she started getting really angry and me and berated me for my fun. She then threw the rest of the round.

At the end in the lobby Trisha tried to see if we wanted to keep playing. Rachel and I both responded positively even though we both were starting to think the mood was ruined. Lenda refused to answer at first and then very angrily said sure. 

At that point my anger got the best of me, and I said, ""You know what I'm done here have a good night, everyone"" and left.   


After that Rachel messaged me and agreed Lenda was being really rude and ruined the fun. Trisha messaged me as well apologizing for the game going bad even though it was not her fault.

That made me feel really bad and like I was an ass for trying to pull the prank and ruining the night that way.

AITA for not properly closing the tent and letting a possum in,"Hey I’m 14f and I am currently on camping holiday with my family. It’s our 3rd day here and I think I kinda messed up. Maybe.

So I’m sharing a tent with my older brother 17m, nicknamed Rio. Basically last night, our parents went to hang with the other parents and neither of us wanted to go socialise with other kids, we stayed back to. It was gonna be a good night, brother and sister bonding. It was getting a bit stuffy so he went and unzipped the tent while I set up the monopoly board. We having a great night and everything was going well but of course we slowly got tired. It was like 1 am I think when we were gonna go sleep so we packed up and closed the tent since we had a mini fan to keep us cool.

It got too stuffy again so he asked me to open the net cause I was closer so I kept the mesh net part down and rolled up the windbreaker part up and went back to sleep.

It was before the time the sun started to rise ish went it got a bit cold so Rio started to use his foot to bring the windbreaker down so I just helped and put it down cause I don’t want his stank foot in my face while I was trying to sleep. Later I heard something shuffling and crunching next to me (we had our stuff on “walls” of tent). I'm a light sleeper so I woke up by turning over and my hand hit whatever was making that noise. It squeaked. It was a possum. A whole cute possum. I petted the possum talking to it, you know automatic stuff when you see something pocket sized. That woke Rio up and his first reaction wasn't 'aww the possum is so cute' it was 'MY PHONE!' The possum ate the peach I was saving and the juice kinda got all over his phone. There was a hole in the mesh net part and since the wind breaker part was never zipped so I guess that's how the pocket sized furball got in.

Now he's mad at me for not zipping up the tent and getting fruit juice into the changing port bit and its all sticky and it's not charging properly. He's getting payback by hiding my canoe oar that I painted  myself HTTYD theme so now I'm sitting on the grass, itching an ant bite. My parents told both us that we should've zipped up our bags.

Am I really the a-hole?  Also I'm letting him use my phone just to be nice and I'm using my Ipad.

update: I talked him when came back and said I was sorry and that if he needed anything he could use my things. He was nice about it and told me where he hid my oar so I can go canoeing now!! He said next time he'd just get up and close the windbreaker. Only problem now is that the charger is sticky and ew. Also thanks, yall are so sweet.

edit: its my first time outdoor camping and ill take note to have food in my tent (: and yes I do live in australia and have encountered possums before, they are sucker for fruits

AITA for not wanting to give up my cat?,"When Smoke came to us, he was skinny and had mats. He had been shot with a bb gun in the leg and had a raging bladder infection. We took him to the vet for wound care and antibiotics. Put him on a prescription diet. Nursed him back to health for a month, and all the while, I was putting up posts on NextDoor and Facebook, and anywhere else I could think of to help find his people. He wasn't microchipped. Nobody came forward. So, after 45 days, we took him to get microchipped and claimed him as our own. We have loved this boy for a year now. He's family. He's especially bonded with my son, who has autism and hangs out with him when the anxiety gets bad. 

Last night, a woman and a little girl came to our door to ask if we took in a grey cat because they saw him in the window. They said he got out when they moved here to AZ from Texas a year ago and have been looking for him everywhere. I brought him out so they could see him and immediately, they said he was theirs.

AITA for declining an invitation for a date?,"I've literally never made a reddit post today so here we go, no idea where else to ask for advice for this lmao

Anyways! My s/o has been asking since yesterday if I want to go to a restaurant or someplace else for valentine's day. unfortunately, I'm extremely drained from my work and my studies, and my social battery has been very depleted lately because of extracurricular things, which I've told them, but I keep getting asked, to which I keep telling them the same thing: that I've got to finish up my work and am unable to go out anywhere at the moment (I have a very big project due this evening that I have to get done).

I feel really bad that I keep declining to go places, because I know that me telling them no is probably hurting their feelings. I've been told no to hanging out on holidays too, and I know it hurt my feelings when that happened, so it probably hurts theirs that I'm basically doing the same thing now. I'm also very much so an introvert, and after spending most of the day working and being around people, I just need that time to myself and to rest for the rest of the day. 

I'm not mad at my s/o at all for inviting me. I simply can't bring myself to go hang out with them today. Though I feel as if I might be the a-hole for repeatedly declining to hang out with them, especially because it's Valentine's day.

WIBTA For flushing my toilet paper?,"Long time lurker, first time poster. I'm using a throwaway account because my username is one I use on different platforms.

I know this sounds like a really weird question but it is honestly keeping me up. I'm a college student and I moved into a different, on-campus apartment this year. Everything's going really well but this one thing came up earlier. Our shared toilet doesn't entirely flush, but it's only just strands of paper come back up and nothing else. (Nothing else is being thrown in). I was talking to some of my roommates and the toilet was brought up. They mentioned how it's an ""older toilet"" (but the building was built in the 80s) and doesn't flush toilet paper well, so they all throw their used toilet paper into the bin. To my knowledge, half of my roommates already do this and I haven't asked/heard from the others. This might just be a culture thing for me or something I just have never heard of before but I find this pretty gross.

I feel like the toilet should be working fine- I lived in a different building last year that was built around the same time as my current one and this was never an issue. But I have been told that this is an older building but I can't find anything on it. The campus also has maintenance people we can call and I feel like ringing them up would fix the issue. I'm mainly worried because we cycle out who throws out the trash cans and I don't really don't want to throw out other peoples used paper and today is the first day the can has really smelled, but I've only been here two weeks. Also, we're still in a panini so there's that too. I'm mainly worried if I would be the a-hole to be the one clogging the toilet or disagreeing with what my roommates think is best.

AITA for wanting my boyfriend to move back in with his parents whilst he goes back to college?,"My boyfriend (32) and I, (F,30) have been living together for around 3 years. He is going back to college at the end of the month to finish his Masters degree that he never was able to complete before we got together. 

I work a really good job that I love and for the most part, have been supporting us anyway, although he does contribute. Maybe like 20-25% of everything. This doesn't bother me at all, I'm happy to pay more as I earn more. Now he's going back to college for a year and won't be earning any money. The only reason he is going back he says, is because I can afford to support us for the year but honestly, I really don't see why I have to. We're not married (don't believe in it) and I really don't want kids, so it's not like eventually i'll have to support a family. I like money and sleep. I'm selfish, so sue me.

AITA for not wanting to support him for a year? I'm pretty certain his parents would love to have him home for a year, but ofcourse at 32 I can understand why he wouldn't want to do that. This is a non-starter conversation for him. He says if he were to move back in with them, that we may as well break up. I wish he would have spoken to me about it before he quit his job otherwise I'd have said that I don't agree with it, would have suggested why not doing it part time so you could still work etc.

I feel like i'm being taken advantage of. I broke up with my ex because I was supporting him 100% and I resented it after a while. It will literally drive me insane knowing that he's not getting up for work, and is running up the utility bills because he's going to be home all day. He'll be in college some days but will be home most of the time working on whatever it is he needs to do.

Edit: so it's pretty equal on whether I am the a-hole or not, but from responses (thank you, whatever you said) I clearly need to clarify a few things.

1. There was only ever a fleeting conversation when we were over at his parents and he said out of the blue, ""I'm thinking of finishing my masters"" his parents were so excited about it, and as it turns out, and they have retired with pretty substantial wealth, and have paid for him to go back to school. I found this out after calling them to voice my concerns. 

2. For those picking up on that 'I like money', I've been independent from my direct family since I was 17. I've been poor. REALLY poor. Making soup out tomato ketchup and hot water poor. Everything I have done has been so I can make my life as I want it. I work freelance and I'm really good at it, I'm not going to apologise for that. Also means that I have no back up if something was to happen to me, so my savings are for if/when that happens. 

3. My bf and I have had a conversation since I posted about this. I felt it was important. He still stands by if he was to go to his parents that we should break up. What I meant by him moving back to them for the year, that was when someone here said we would see each other when we could. His parents are closer to school and where we are is like 1.5 hours away. He's too proud for that though. 

4. Sure, whether he goes or stays my rent will be the same, but I'm not getting that 20-25% from which I've been able to save with my income. 

5. His masters is in something to do with English literature, and the job that he just quit, for all I knew he loved it. Now he's quit to do a (in my eyes) pointless masters? No. If it was medical school or engineering or a good job where he NEEDED a masters, I'd probably be more on board with it.

6. He suffers from anxiety, and will only ever do anything he would be able to do. Which means no part time job.

7. If we'd have actually talked and decided on this new path together, I would have no bones about it. But the arrogance and flippant nature of his attitude that I would foot the bill for a year has really upset and angered me. We're committed to each other and he pulls this on me?

AITA for not visiting my grandparents because they're old and grandma has dementia?,"First, I want to say I'm 100% certain that I'm the a-hole. I don't know if my certainty is genuine, or just conditioned due to my being the scapegoat/black sheep of my family.

I'm 23. I love my grandparents, but I never visit them.

I never was too close to them growing up. They're not estranged, but we're not close. They left the U.S. as Missionaries for a few years when I was young, and I don't have many memories of them before they left.
I was much closer to my other grandparents.

Grandma (80s) has dementia. She's going downhill *fast*. It's taking a huge toll on Grandpa (90s). He doesn't sleep much due to her sundowning, and does *everything* to take care of them.
One time when my family were struggling, we moved in with them, both to have a roof over our heads, and to help them out. (5-6 years ago.) We didn't know Grandma was as sick as she is.
One night, I heard her and Dad arguing in the. Then I heard glass shatter and screaming.
I'm afraid of anger and yelling, so I listened to music to keep calm.
Dad came into my room and said, ""Keep Bob (my cat) in your room tonight. Lock the door. *Do not* open it until I knock in the morning."" He then told me she said she'd do something to us that I can't say here. 
Every night for the time we lived there, we slept with our doors locked.

Dad told me if I do visit them, to either go with him, or to leave before late afternoon if I go alone, and to *never* be alone with Grandma.

I also have PTSD when it comes to death/funerals and elderly people (especially sick and/or elderly women). When I was younger (12-13), I lost three people within five months, one of them being Granny. Granny was my best friend and safe haven. I was closest to her. When she passed, I lost everything. Her funeral was the last that I have ever attended. (I attempted to attend a deacon's at my church funeral a couple years ago. I panicked, hyperventilated, and Mom took me home.)
I secluded from everything and everyone. My therapist diagnosed me with PTSD (and several other things). It's bad enough to the point where if I *see* an elderly person (specifically a woman who looks the *slightest* bit like Granny), I will panic. Grandma looks *nothing* like Granny, but she's much older (my brain terrorizes me about the fact that their times are coming), and she sometimes smells like Granny's perfume.

Last time I visited, I was anxious as hell. My mind flashed back to when I was 12-13. It told me things like, ""What if they just dropped right now?""

I want to visit them because they don't have much time left, but that's the exact reason why I don't go.

I feel like I'm the a-hole because of all of that. I rarely bring it up when Dad asks why I don't visit. I don't like making excuses. My sister says I need to ""get over myself"" and just go and visit them. She says I'm selfish, and I'm starting to believe her.

AITA for seeming distant in my relationship?,"For the past few months, I (18M) and my girlfriend (19F) have had more than a few rough moments relating to my inability to stay focused when talking to her. I'd like to preface that her and I are both neurodivergent; I have ADHD and she is autistic. We are also mainly an online relationship, but we've been going steady for almost a year and we've known each other for longer.

I do not know when this really started, but it's something I struggle with, really, every day. I'll be messaging my girlfriend, us both focused on a topic or something we're both doing (that I potentially have to hold up my end of) and then I'll look over at something else. Maybe it's something I'm watching on TV, maybe it's a hole of browsing through Wikipedia, maybe it's checking Twitter. Whatever it is I get distracted with, I only intend to check it for a minute before getting to what I'm meant to do. But then I get lost in this thing, sometimes to the point of spacing out. One minute turns to ten turns to fifteen, and by then I panic and scramble back to message her.

There's also times when we have something going on, but for one reason or another I don't focus on it. I spend time focusing on chatting with her and seemingly ignoring the thing we're working on, I message a group chat we're both in... Either way, I unintentionally blow off things we're working on for stretches of time that I only meant to be for a few minutes or so. 

There's more examples that I'll probably remember, but this is mainly what happens. Me stepping away from our conversation or things that we're working on because of a distraction that I... don't really want to be distracted by.

This has caused a lot of stress for my girlfriend. She has many commitments in her own life, be they taking care of her pets, going to college and dealing with that immense workload, and many many other things. And yet, she still makes time to talk to me, even when she hasn't got time for anything else she enjoys. You can imagine how upset it makes her to seem me always go silent or have my messages to her be punctuated by 10-15 minute gaps, gaps that I don't intend to create. 

I'm trying to work on this, but there always seem to be moments where it gets really bad and she reaches a breaking point. It's made me feel like such an a-hole for not nipping it in the bud immediately. Am I the asshole here?",No A-holes here
AITA for continuing to walk when a lady told me not to?,"I am starting to feel bad about this incident and I want reddit to tell me if I am the a-hole or not.

So today I was walking my dog and I was zoned out. I was listening to my podcast, I had a song stuck in my head, and I was also talking to myself. I had a lot going on in my head. The only other things I was really paying attention to besides what was going on in my head was my dog and if people were walking in my direction so I could make sure we could get out of the way. This is how I am most walks btw, I am zoned out doing my own thing with no real intentions of listening to strangers when I am out and about.

So we are walking, minding our own business when this lady (who is ahead of me) says something to me, I take my headphone out, but I didn't really process what she said. I assumed she just said hi because I think I have seen her before, so I moved into the street and kept walking like I usually do. Suddenly her dog is up next to my dog and she's yelling at me.

It is important to note that she had a little cast thing on her right arm that was pinning her arm to her body, so she only had one functioning arm to control this dog. (He was like a medium sized dog, maybe a husky mix?""

She said ""Why couldn't you have just done what I asked and stopped walking?"" I apologized out of utter confusion because I honestly was not paying attention to what she was saying. And then she told me to keep walking so I did.

It didn't occur to me until after I had already walked away that she had asked me to stop walking so that she could get into her house with her dog. Now in the moment I don't feel like I was the AH because if you can't control your dog, you obviously shouldn't be walking your dog. Maybe she didn't have anybody else who could take her dog out, but you shouldn't rely on strangers to stop what they are doing to comply with what you want them to do.

Now that I have calmed down a bit, I feel like I am kind of the AH. Maybe I should have been paying more attention to what she was saying to me? Maybe I should have asked her to repeat herself, and I feel kind of bad now that the moment is over.

So reddit, am I the asshole for continuing to walk when someone told me not to?

In compliance with dog tax, here is my dog- [https://imgur.com/a/VtDESih](https://imgur.com/a/VtDESih)

Edit: I am going to try and be more aware of my surroundings from now on. Just to make it clear I wasn't on autopilot walking blindly, I was paying attention to things ahead of me and I was watching my dog. From now on though, I will make it a point to keep my volume down so I can pay more attention around me just in case something like this happens again. Thanks for all the judgement's and feedback.

WIBTA if I ask husband not to go to the gym for 2 hours?,"My husband works 4 days a week, 10 hours a day but once a month he has to work the weekend. I work from home, care for the house and our 2 kids. Husband goes to the gym 3-4 times a week for 2 hours each time. On the other days he takes the dog and goes for a run, usually an hour to 90 minutes. I workout at home when the kids are at school or asleep. Today happens to be a weekend day that husband had to work. He comes home, changes clothes and left for the gym, he will be gone for about 2.5 hours. This means that he will get back about bedtime for the kids. Would I be the a-hole if I asked him not to go to the gym after working all day on the weekends anymore? 

During the week I don't care but after leaving me to care for the kids all day with no break, I find it a bit unfair that he comes home, gets the kids and dog all riled up and leaves 5 min later. I'm left to deal with them being upset that Dad only spent 5 minutes here and almost none of it with them.

WIBTA if I said ‘career or kids’,"Not the best title but I will explain.

I (F26) am 10 years younger than my boyfriend of 6 years and we’ve been rocking this relationship up until recently. 

I am about to start a career in law and it’s been a very uphill battle to get here, my boyfriend has an established career in a completely different sector and now he’s inspired by me and wants to start again so he can have a legal career. I think it’s great, follow your goals and live your dream however, this means as I’m working my way up and establishing myself he’s going to be a duckling and starting from the very beginning.

In the past we’ve discussed kids and I love children but I honestly don’t mind either way if I do or do not have kids (sounds horrible but that’s the only way I can describe it). He on the other hand really wants kids, so we jointly decided that if we have a child he can use the maternity leave to be the stay at home dad. This is mostly because his job is stable, he is very respected and very established in his line of work so taking 6 months to a year out won’t effect him at all and he wants to take that time out for a kid and I do not. If I had to take 6 months out it could ruin my career. 

Now he wants to start again with his career, would I be the a-hole If I said “if you choose this route I don’t feel like we can have children” or something along those lines. I don’t like the idea of stepping on someone’s dreams and I personally would hate it if someone told me ‘no’ but the again I don’t want to be in the position where I have to sacrifice my career because plans have changed.

"AITA? My GF is upset that I’m sick but don’t always listen to her medical advice, and we keep arguing about it","Okay hi this is a new account because I have friends on here that know my other, gonna use fake names, all that jazz 

So about 1.5 months ago I was diagnosed with cancer, it’s low-stage and not as major as it could be, but I’m taking chemo pills and other medications to deal with it which have a lot of side affects. Some of which include fatigue, dizziness, irritability, things of that nature 

Max (21F) and I have been dating for a while and living together for almost a year now, and have gone through multiple other health things as a team. She’s always been great when I’ve had issues in the past and I’ve tried to do the same for her. 

Now to get into the problems-for the past month or so, anytime I’ve been feeling sickly or upset or gotten irritable for no reason (other than meds and cancer being generally hard to deal with) I’ve tried to kind of distance myself from others so I don’t bother anyone (usually this just means taking a nap, or laying in bed and resting). 

However, since Max and I live (and are quarantined) together it’s hard to distance from each other and she has been trying so hard to fix things and be super helpful when I’m feeling badly. Along with this she tries to tell me what I have to do, even when I know doing something differently would be healthy and safe. I definitely appreciate it and I tell her all the time that I appreciate her being here for me, but I also tell her that I can take care of myself and make safe decisions for my body. 
All that to say, she definitely knows it bothers me sometimes because I vocalize it. 

A few days ago we had a big argument because I had a low-grade fever and she wanted to drive me to a hospital, but I called my oncologist and he said I would be okay at home as long as I checked my temp every 30min and it didn’t rise. I kept telling her what my oncologist said, and telling her that if my temp started to rise I would go without arguing, but she kept trying to tell me what she thought was the best thing to do (even though my doctor was saying differently). I kept repeatedly telling her I was fine and she didn’t have to take care of me (it wasn’t a yelling match, but definitely firm and intense voices), and she got mad that I wasn’t listening to her and we haven’t really talked in 2 days because of it. 

Honestly, I definitely understand that she wants to help take care of me because cancer is a lot to deal with, but at the same time I feel like my opinions should matter too? I’ve talked to close friends and my dad about this and they think I overreacted and should have just let her help.

AITA For giving my mother an ultimatum?,"For context I F(22) have two vehicles at the moment, a 2015 coupe and a motorcycle. I got my car back in 2020 when I bought it from my grandparents via a loan I took out in my name. Ever since I got my car, it was kind of an understanding that my mom F(43) may ask to use it once in a while. She already has three vehicles of her own. A truck, a coupe, and a motorcycle are all either in the front of the house or in the garage. It doesn't bother me a lot since my car isn't a newer model and it is my first car so mistakes have been made. Well, my loan will be paid off on the car next fall, and I am looking to get an SUV. My reasons are that by next fall both of our dogs will be 70lbs+ so it will be nice with how much we take them to the dog park, living in the northern midwest, it will be amazing to have in winter for the ice/snow. Here is where I think I might be the a-hole. My mom has helped me with the loan at some point. I told her since she uses my car just as much as I do, whether it is to take care of the dogs, just drive it daily, or take it across the country for a road trip with her friend. Then I want her to put money towards it.

I told her the other day that come fall when I get my SUV, I want to sell the 2015 coupe so that I don't have three vehicles in my name, being a college student, I definitely can't afford that amount of Insurance payments. Getting a loan for my new vehicle won't be hard since the coupe will be paid off and I am being reasonable by looking for something that would be a similar monthly payment as what I have now. My mother practically snapped at me mid-sentence claiming that I can't sell it since she put money into it and that she will pay the insurance on it instead of me. After she finished her outburst, I tried to rationalize to her the fact that she already has three vehicles of her own.  She would not budge on the fact of keeping my coupe. I looked at her and told her that if she wants to keep my coupe then she needs to sell her 2006 coupe.

AITA for being mad my tour was not in an (for me) understandable language?,"Okay, I normally never post but I would truly like to know if I am in the wrong here.

We are on vacation in Austria for a whole week (for those who do not know, they speak German there. I however do not...). We did some super fun activities including rafting and sledding (on those iron rails, super fun!), but in the end I mostly looked forward to going to a Stift (Abbey, or Monastery or however you want to translate this). 

I really love to learn so I was truly looking forward to this. The best part of my holiday always is going to Cathedrals, Castles or, in this case, an Abbey. I like to see those things and learn about these monuments, so I truly looked forward to going to the Abbey. I looked it up beforehand, there was a tour and I convinced my family to go!   

Well, today we went. And when we got there, we were in that tour with two Frenchmen and a German. The tour guide asked us what language we would like the tour to be, and I asked it to be in English. She (the tour guide) speaks (as i know of) proper English, German, and French. The Frenchmen asked it to be in French, the German asked it to be in German (all logically...). She said she would not like to do the tour in three languages, but it wouldn’t have been a problem if she would have had to do it. It would just take a little longer. 

So then my mom really quickly caved in and said only German and French is fine. My mother is sufficient in fluent, but not a sufficient interpreter. So that’s that... The tour was only done in German and in French...

The thing I loved to do the most on holiday was for me a big disappointment because I was not able to understand a word in German. I really tried my best because I’d have really loved to know what she said but it was just not possible for me to understand what she said. 

I became quite mad by the fact that I was not able to hear the tour, which I looked forward for quite some time (didn’t do anything bad, I was just visibly mad). I said this to my mom, but she said that she’s done all that she’s can and that the tour guide really can’t do it in three languages. I did not ask the tour guide again because my mom would have became mad if I did.

During the tour, my mother told me to get over myself and that there was nothing she could have done to make sure the tour would also have been in English. 

I disagreed and became mad at my mom because this was the ONE thing I truly cared about this whole holiday, because to tell you all the truth - haven’t told this to anyone because it seems ungrateful for this vacation - I’d just as much would have loved to stay home this week EXCEPT for the abbey. 

So, was I the A-hole for getting mad the tour was not in a (for me) understandable language? And for getting mad after my mom telling me to get over myself?

Every Monday after school I walk 20 minutes to the library and stay there for 2 hours. I usually work on homework then I write a story I've been working on. It peaceful and quiet there and I love it. 

Now my sister says that it's unfair that I go to the library and she has to ride the bus home. She wants to come with me and hang out with me for the whole 2 hours until our girl scouts meeting across the street at 5:30. I really don't think it's a good idea nor do I actually want here there.

My argument: she goes to a different school on the other side of town. She'd have to walk to the library by herself which I don't think my mom would like. If for some reason my mother allows it then there's no reason that she couldn't walk to the library an other day of the week when I'm not there trying to finish my homework. 

I always have people around me all the time because I'm involved in so many activities. Marching band, the play, youth group, girl scouts, ect. Sometimes it's nice to go to the library and not have to talk to anyone or pay attention to what they're doing. The library is like an escape for me. That's why I don't want her there. I'd have to talk to her if she got bored and I'd have to keep an eye on her. 

Sister's argument: I just want to spend more time with my sister. She's always gone and doing stuff so what'll it hurt if I see her for 2 more extra hours? She never wants to be around me and she's never at home anymore. All I want is to go there and spend some time with her. I already went with her once for the last hour she was there and I didn't talk to her or disrupt her and she still got mad. 

And if I want to go to the library then I should be allowed to. I hardly get any service at home and we don't have high speed internet like the library does. Without my sister there I get creeped out by everyone there so I don't want to go by myself. I want to go with someone I know so I don't feel uncomfortable.

AITA for applying for a job my mom prefers I not have?,"I (f20) have been living at my parents’ home since January after deciding to take a year off of university. Initially, it was to recover from a concussion (oof didn’t know how hard uni was when your brain isn’t working), but I would like to work so that I can actually pay for my last semester of uni myself, instead of relying on my parents. I truly appreciate that they have supported me financially throughout my university years. I’ve worked every semester/summer except when I was abroad, but it definitely did not cover all of my costs. 

So, my parents both work in juvenile rehabilitations (colloquially known as juvie). My father has worked in the field all my life, and my mother started working in it when I was finishing high school. Their facility has three lodges, and they are both supervisors, but in different lodges. 

When I was younger I had always talked about wanting to work in the same field. When I moved back in, I joked about applying to be an “on call” security officer there. My mother told me it would be a bad idea, as well as my brother in law (who also lives here part of the time and works as an adult on call). My brother’s primary reasoning is that I am a young women, and that I am too nice. My mother’s reasoning is that it would be difficult for her and my father to supervise me because I am their daughter (my counter is that they already supervise their son in law), and that the negative/sexist comments from the boys (it is a male only facility) would get to her too much. My father, while not necessarily supportive of me applying, helped me with my application, pro/conned the position, and has been generally level headed about the situation. 

I had mostly forgotten about applying because it’s been a few weeks. I’ll be honest, I was pretty butthurt about my mom’s reaction. I’ve heard the complaints from her about stupid coworkers who don’t know how to work with youth and I HAVE EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH AT RISK YOUTH.

I already knew about this scheme since I watch alot of videos on different schemes, but where I feel I wronged here is that I didn't hammer it into him to quit. I told him once on how they're a huge scam and how they ruin lives, but he of course didn't believe me. And I didn't feel like fighting with him about it so I just left it. I feel like I should have done more to help him quit it.. so Reddit AITA for not making my friend quit his really bad job?",No A-holes here
AITA if I took two days off my family trip to visit my grandparents for the last time just so that I could attend my middle school orchestra performance?,"I'm a 13 year old girl and have played violin for around 7 years and am in my middle schools more experienced orchestra, I guess. I really don't want to sound overly confident or brag here, I'm just using the information so that maybe I'm not as much of an asshole as if I were to stay for a smaller level performance, know what I mean?

Our family had planned a trip this October to visit my grandparents, for unfortunately what may be the last time. This trip just so happens to be planned the same day as the concert (they were unaware of this). I feel more disappointed than should be. I can't even understand myself on why I would want to postpone my trip in order to play for a middle school orchestra concert. I also found out this was the same day we take a group photo. I know, another terrible reason for me to stay. And no, I'm not saying ""I have to stay, or else my gorgeous talented self won't be in the group photo!"" It just makes me seriously happy to be there and play. Nobody has to notice me, I don't have to be first chair, I just enjoy it. I also acknowledge that it should make me much happier to be with my grandparents, and it does. It's extremely difficult to explain what I'm thinking at the moment. I myself am not completely sure why I seem to be obsessed with being at the concert.

My grandparents will be disappointed and my parents are too. I didn't think about that before being annoying, which is selfish.

After being a selfish idiot for a few days, my mom scheduled my ticket for two days after the performance and my other relative who lives near us can take me to the airport. I'm not proud of this. I just need reassurance that I am in fact an a-hole.

Am I being silly... AITA?!",No A-holes here
AITA for not wanting to go out with my mom?,"So here’s a little backstory. My mom has always been an amazing mother. She has always taken care of me and my siblings and done pretty much everything for us. Ever since she divorced my father, she started using her days off work (this is usually her only free time) to take us out and do literally anything. This could be going to the store, playing mini golf of bowling, or anything that isn’t just staying indoors. At first, me and my siblings had no other option as we were fairly young, around 13 years old, but now that I’m 19 and in college I don’t feel like going out with her anymore. I have nothing against her, I would just rather stay at home and keep doing my own thing. Today, after she asked me to go out and “do something” I rejected her offer and later saw her crying. I asked her why to which she responded, “I spend 9-10 hours working almost everyday just so that I can finally maybe go out with you guys, but you guys don’t seem to care.” I can’t help but feel like an a-hole for not wanting to go out with her, but I really would just rather stay at home since we’ve been going out and doing random things for as long as I remember. So AITA?

AITA for a series of bad decisions involving a $20 cake?,"My (F37) family is very close. My husband’s (M51) is not so much. We maybe get together two or three times a year. I don’t think I have ever really hung out with all of them at once for any extended period of time except for our wedding ten years ago. Mostly because everyone is scattered around the country. 

My mother in law is having a milestone birthday this year so she rented an air B and B in a city about equidistant from all of her children to come and gather to celebrate. The task fell upon us to order the cake because she loved our (publix-nothing fancy) wedding cake (raspberry elegance if you’re interested—everyone loved it would highly recommend if you want a wedding cake on the cheap) and wanted a small one for her fete. As we were going to pick it up, my husband asked me, “Did you have them write ‘Happy Birthday’ on it?” I had ordered it online for pick up in the destination state and didn’t see an option for that kind of customization, so I hadn’t. But that got my wheels spinning. “Should I have gotten them to write on the cake? Would it be too impersonal to get her a plain Publix cake? What am I, an asshole daughter in law with no appreciation for milestone birthdays that involve people coming from all corners of the country?”

Once I got to the bakery counter I nicely asked the bakery employee who assisted me in retrieving my order (and pay special attention to the verbiage I used here), “Do you have and kind of birthday confection or adornment I could buy for the cake?” I was thinking about a time I had gotten a “Happy Birthday” sign with lettering between two stakes or some candy letters, etc. On other occasions. Instead, the bakery employee happily chirped, “Oh, would you like me to write on the cake?! I’d be happy to do that!!!” Well her eagerness, enthusiasm, and position as a Publix bakery professional made me have some confidence in her abilities, especially if she was willing to offer her skills (for the most part?) unsolicited. 

Here is where things might go to Ass(hole) Vegas: I said yes. I trusted that she knew what she was doing! Was I an asshole for having confidence in her skill? 

Unfortunately the asshole train doesn’t end there. She asked me what to write on the cake. My head was spinning. I was thinking I should get “Happy birthday, Mom.” But then I thought, well there are grandchildren there, too. They wouldn’t call her mom, right? I don’t remember a cake for my grandmother ever saying “Happy Birthday, Mom” on it. So I told her to write “Happy Birthday, Elaine.”  I walked off with the cake thinking all was good. 

Two aisles later I run into my husband who sees the cake. The lettering looks like it was done by a fourth grader. Am I the asshole for letting someone “mangle” the cake with an “office break room” style greeting?",No A-holes here
AITA for calling an ambulance for my neighbor? How about for alerting the landlord?,"I share a hallway with my neighbor, and this morning around 3am, I was awoken by a HUGE crash which was obviously someone falling down the stairs.  I went into the hallway to find my neighbor half dressed (her pants were pulled down around her upper thighs exposing her butt) and moaning.  She was obviously drunk, but she has also obviously fallen down a flight of stairs.  

She didn’t seem injured, but she was disoriented, and at first she was okay with me calling the ambulance, but by the time the EMTs got there a few minutes later, she had started to not want them to come.  She decided to go back upstairs.  I led them to her and got out of the way.  They did assess her and I heard her complaining that I was “in her business.”  They convinced her to go to the hospital I guess just to be checked out since she had been drinking.

Now this was a fall on my landlords property, so I thought he should be aware.  I sent him a text telling him that she had fallen and that I called the EMTs and they took her for assessment.  I also mentioned that she wasn’t happy with me calling, but I didn’t mention that she was drunk or half naked… only that she had been disoriented. I was thinking of liability and that he should be aware.

When she came home, I am pretty sure I heard her complaining that I “called everyone.”

So… AITA?

EDIT:  let’s start by saying I am TA for contacting the landlord. That’s the general consensus, although it’s not unanimous. I accept that judgment.

However, I don’t accept the motives people are ascribing to it.

Now that I’ve had time to process the whole thing, I feel like I need to respond in general to the idea that I said anything with a motive of either getting her in trouble or spreading gossip.

If I had wanted to get her in trouble, she’s done other things that I could’ve complained about reasonably. I haven’t because that’s not actually my goal. I have no desire to get her in trouble. The sense that she does that annoy me or in frequent enough that I can let them go.  Some of them are just annoyances like noise complaints, and one is more serious that I don’t feel comfortable putting on here. It hasn’t affected me directly, but other neighbors have also complained about the same thing to me.  That problem involves a boyfriend that she appears to no longer be with, so it’s not really an issue.

I know the stairs are a little bit shady. I think they’re in code, I don’t feel comfortable climbing on myself, my previous neighbor fell down them once but not as seriously. I think the main problem that I see with them is that you have to stand on the top step and lean back to unlock the door. So is it possible that the fall was caused by the configuration of the stairs? Yes.

Falling down the stairs is not an annoyance. It’s an emergency.  So let me explain a little bit where my mind was last night.  

I was very sound asleep when I was woken up. It was a loud stumbling crash followed by very weak moaning.  I was scared. It took me probably two minutes to get up the nerve to open the door because I don’t have a peek hole and I had no idea who or what I would find, but I did that someone was probably hurt.  there was no light shining under the door so The hurt person had to be leaning against the door.  I remember being afraid that whoever it was would fall in to my home, and since I didn’t know who it was or what was happening, that concept scared me.

I also recognize that the likelihood was high that it was my neighbor, and that she was probably hurt.

I open the door and found what you know: a crumpled up half naked unconscious (I’m not sure if I should be saying semi conscious because she was moaning) girl.

I was not thinking “Oh cool! What a great story.“ What I was thinking was “oh shit. What do I do?“

I was scared and trying to do the right thing. So yes… I am TA for making a bad decision to contact the landlord, but I did not make that decision because I wanted to hurt anyone. And it really bothered me that so many people said that’s why I did it. So if I appeared to be arguing against that judgment, that’s why.  I wasn’t arguing against the judgment itself, but rather the motives people have ascribed to my decision.

I accept my judgement, though.",No A-holes here
AITA for making a boobs joke?,"It happened yesterday, but I'm still thinking about it, so I need an external opinion.

In December 2021 I had a surgery for a breast cancer. It was in the very early stage, the surgeon removed it completely, but I still had to do radiotherapy sessions and many follow-up visits.  
Yesterday I had the visit with the breast specialist. He was in the examination room with two residents. These rooms have an examination table and a curtain that can be pulled to prevent the patient from being visible from the corridor, should someone open the door (this is relevant for what happened).

As usual, I sit on the table and took off my shirt and bra. The curtain was open but I just didn't notice.  
But suddenly the doctor yelled at one of the residents, *""Move and pull the curtain. What if someone opens the door? Do I always have to say everything?""*  
Suddenly the mood became very tense and I tried to ease it with a joke, *""It's not a problem, doctor. By now, half of the hospital staff has seen my boobs. Actually, I could open an OnlyFans when I'm here.""*  
The residentes smiled, the doctor didn't. On the contrary, he became even more tense, abrupt and angry.

When I went back to my workplace, I told boss and coworkers what happened. A coworker suggested not to think about it too much, the doctor was probably in a bad mood.  
But boss said I was an a-hole, because the doctor wanted to be courteous and protect my privacy, then he was right to get mad at the resident because they have to learn what to do without constant inputs, and that with my joke I undermined the doctor's authority in front of the residents.

WIBTA if I told my mum to cook my dinner earlier,"I (24F) live with my parents and always have done. Whilst I would love to move out and have a place of my own I am expected to stay with them until marriage due to their traditions and beliefs. I don’t mind this too much because I’ll probably be married in the next couple of years and while I pay towards the bills; it is not a lot in comparison to what I would do usually in this city. 

My mother does most of the cooking in the house but I also cook a few times a week. A couple of months ago she started cooking dinner later - often finishing at 11pm - as my father apparently preferred to eat late and it seems to suit her too. Tbh it didn’t really bother me too much and if I was hungrier any earlier I would just make myself something. 

Currently we are experiencing a mice infestation. Now I am petrified and I can’t tell you how anxious them being in the house makes me. I’ve done the little I can do to try and deter them however my father refuses to get any work done to the house i.e blocking off spaces and holes that the mice can come in through.  He has plenty of money to do so and I have offered the money myself but he won’t budge and there’s so much I can do myself without his permission as it is his house. 

The mice have taken a liking to the kitchen as mice do and often come out as soon as it is dark. I refuse to go in there and cook myself because of my phobia and on most days I just wait for my mum to finish cooking. I’m also getting take away food when I can but that’s not really a solution. Sometimes I’m just sitting up in my room having not eaten in 9/10 hours because I’m just waiting for dinner to be done. Cooking earlier doesn’t work because of my job and I don’t enjoy snacking either. I want to tell her to start cooking earlier. WIBTA if I did?

Edit: I feel like people are focusing on the wrong thing here. When I said I don’t mind living with my parents I really mean it! In fact I quite like it sometimes. Yes I did say I would love to move out but it’s more of an eventual thing. Most of me wants to stay.  I can’t afford to either. It suits my parents and me.",No A-holes here
AITA for getting frustrated with my mentally ill friend,"Ok for info I have a friend Ill refer to her as M she has BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) so she has huge mood swings.

She then says ""because if he doesn't I will haunt him"" I then reply with ""M you can't haunt him ghost aren't real"". Then my friend then yells at me to ""cut out that atheist bull crap"" and just as the theological argument was about to start as I could tell in the tone of M's voice as well as her going just ""because you can't prove they aren't real doesn't make you right"" to which I made up an excuse to get off the phone. so now I'm sitting here annoyed and frustrated because I feel like augments and situations like these are all to common and because of M's mental illness I'm always at a disadvantage and end up being the ""Bad Guy"" So I need to know am I the A-hole or better yet what to do in the future in situations like this?

So I am used to it; but my friend says its really mean so I figured I'd ask.

So last week I told my dad that I really want to go out to this place I really like because I don't get to go out; he of course said no because he wants to relax from being at work. (And the trip he took the day before)

I told my mum, a few days later, that I really wanted to go to said location because I really want to get out of the house and do more things, I can't drive so I can't get to places. Buses don't reach any where particulary interesting either.

So today they both go to town and had been taking a while, so I called to find out when they were heading home so I know when to put dinner on.
They tell me they went out to the location ive been wanting to go to >.> 

I asked if they were joking and they went ""no"" and I said ""you know I've been really wanting to go""
""Yea but we didn't think you were up to it, sorry"" my dad's apology was a half hearted one that was just said for the sake of it really.
I said ""no it's fine. I'm used to it"" of which my dad continued to act as if I'm the ass hole for being disapointed.

They have done this in the past many times and each time acted like I'm the asshole when I've said that I'm upset that they go to places I've specifically asked to go only a few days prior.

So AITA for being upset that they do this?

Edit to add: clarity here 😅 I've nothing against my parents doing things alone and I encourage them to have alone time as often as i can, even going out of my way so they can be alone.
It's just really hurtful when they pick locations to visit that I've asked to visit days after I've asked, if it was a few weeks it wouldn't be an issue 😅",No A-holes here
AITA for being upset at a friend who only talks to me when shes lonely,"so i've had this friend for years, online as she lives in cali but travels for work. we used to talk a lot when we were younger and then it slowed down but now, for the most part, our longest conversations happen when she is bored or lonely or looking for some sort of validation. the other night we started talking while she was out at a bar and eventually she asked me if i would essentially validate her and make her feel better about herself (she thinks she is overweight) and i might get something for it. Of course i agree and we keep chatting and it kinda gets side tracked as we talk about a bunch of other things, all while i still manage to complement the fuck out of her and build her up. at one point she made the point to say ""we're basically in like a loooooong distance poly-emotional relationship"" (she's actually in a poly relationship with someone else) and also say how great i am for always being there for her no matter if she talks to me for hours on end or just once a month and how she appreciates me. after a few hours of talking and me staying up way past my usual bed time to keep her company, she falls asleep on me, which is nbd. but the next morning she read any messages i had left her and then just doesn't reply, no thanks for keeping me company or hey i appreciate that, she just goes right back to not replying. 
AITA for being annoyed even tho she explained the night before that that is basically just how she is? im just sick of building people up only to be ignored when they dont need the confidence boost for the time being

EDIT: i also would feel like the A-hole if right after she was like ""im so glad youre always here for me even if i dont reply all the time"" and then i come back with ""yeah im mad you're not as good of a friend as i want you to be"" if that makes sense",No A-holes here
AITA for tricking people into helping me?,"Ok so, here´s the thing: I am a content creator, but my content is not very well known. Recently, another content creator from that same fandom has offered to upload a picture of one of my fan-made characters which appear in my fanfiction.

What sounds like a nice gesture kinda gets soured by the fact that he is also planning to upload a picture of one of my characters, and link my fanfiction under that picture, and I´m sure I wouldn´t have helped him had he not offered to draw my character. 

I really don´t know if I should feel bad about making him do extra work to get a bigger audience just so his audience may become my audience as well.

WIBTA If I were to buy a Minecraft realm after my friend already started one?,"Some info before the post: We are all 14 years old and a realm is basically a server in Minecraft. I am on mobile as well so sorry about formatting. It is currently night here so i might be sleeping if you don’t get a response.

About half a week ago i told my friend Adam that i was thinking about starting a realm because me and two other friends were getting into Minecraft again. Adam then proceeds to tell me about an old realm of his that he could start up again. I tell him that that is kind but a bit unnecessary for i was planning on buying one.
He then proceeds to buy a 1 month long subscription for a Minecraft realm and invites me to play.

Me, being slightly annoyed of him buying a realm minutes after me saying that i would start one still gratefully accept his invite and  hop on the realm. But here comes the problem;

My two other friends are not from the same country so we three speak English for everyone’s ease. Adam on the other hand does not like to talk English and we keep our conversations in Swedish.
Now i started trying to make Adam invite my two other friends so we could play together (after all i wanted to play on a realm with my two other friends not just by myself or with Adam) but he kept on refusing because he didn’t want to speak english. This isn’t the problem in itself because for me it is understandable to want to speak your home language. 

The problem is that I am stuck in a spot where I would feel like an a-hole if I quit his realm to start a new just to invite everyone (including Adam and my two other friends but if I stayed then i would exclude my two other friends which made me want to play Minecraft initially.

So Reddit. If I were to start a new realm so I could invite my two other friends and everyone who wanted to play, even tho there already is an existing realm that my friend Adam paid for, WIBTA?",No A-holes here
AITA for not wanting to move to another state?,"I (24,f) moved to another state with my family right before the start of my senior year of high school after living in Chicago for 10 years (2005 - 2015, technically 10 yrs and 3 months).

After moving back I rarely got sick like I did while living in Chicago however I was also in a committed relationship too (23, m). We've been together for 10 years now and he wants me to move back to Chicago to move in with him. He says that i wouldn't have to wait for the bus and that he can pick me up and drop me off at work to prevent me from getting sick even though I tell him it is the cold weather and that if I go back it will not end well. I've already discussed me going back with my doctors at least health wise and they have all recommended that I shouldn't go back due to my extensive medical history. When I try to convince him to move out to Cali he always makes the excuse of it being too expensive and that it would be cheaper and the smartest option to live in Chicago.

At times I even refer some of my potential customers to him or even buy some codes from him for my regular customers. (I did get lower price from him)

AITA for getting mad at someone on a flight for putting their friend next to me without asking?,"So earlier this week I had a very unsettling human exchange with someone on my flight from Los Angeles to New York and it’s been plaguing me that I still feel so annoyed by it. Looking to calm myself down by someone either confirming these women were rude or telling me I’m the a-hole. 

Got a flight from LAX to JFK this past Wednesday. I have a deeply sprained ankle and am wearing a giant aircast. Everyone sees me and my cast hobbling along to aisle to my seat (hard to be subtle with a giant plastic boot) because I was the literal last person to board. 

I take my seat next to a nice gentleman. I’m ready to pass out for the flight by reading my book. Right before we take off, a female runs back to the man sitting next to me and says “no one is sitting next to me! They never showed up - come sit with me!” So the man leaves and sits next to who I can only assume is his girlfriend or sister. 

I’m thinking I must’ve done something great in my past life to have deserved such luck!! Now I have no one sitting next to me and can elevate my foot during the flight, since I’m prone to blood clots and was worried. 

However, almost immediately once the gentleman leaves, the woman across the aisle leans over and asks “did that man just leave?!?”, so I nod curtly and begin spreading my leg out, aircast and all and nodding off to sleep. I was hoping she would get the hint that just because there was an open seat next to me, didn’t mean I wanted to share it. 

I’m awoken by this woman’s friend standing above me, with the women across the aisle, staring straight at me, saying “my friend is going to sit here.” 

I was super disorientated upon waking so I just started adjusting myself and the woman took her new seat without a word. Once she is settled, she points at my boot and asks “did you just have surgery?”  

I’m so irked by her audacity to recognize my cast and my discomfort and also bluntly disregard her contribution to my discomfort. 

Edited to include here: once I full woke up, I leaned to the woman across the aisle and told her she was rude for not asking me if her friend could sit there and for disregarding my leg and cast. She simply said “okay” and I didn’t push it any further. 

I’ve spent days so taken aback by this exchange. I know I was always going to have to sit next to another person, but I feel as if I had a stroke of good luck that someone stole from me.

Also info about how's there a 2 week order time if she did want to buy one.
Side note- if your heard of or read the book about peoples love languages.. well mine is gifts and my wife's is not.
Now that night I get home and sit at the table talking to my wife about our days and then she brings up the grill. She thinks it's completely unreasonable for me to ask for a present that expensive. She points out that we already have a good bbq. I agree but point out the difference. One can smoke meat the other can cook meat.
She hasn't put any money aside for anything at all so is frustrated at me for asking for such a gift and that anything else she might get can only be disappointing from here on. I point out that I'm a pretty simple guy and only have so many hobbies and that we currently live a pretty simple life although we both work and could live more generously.

AITA for questioning a company leader/mentor about how much the company values its people?,"I work at a top European consulting firm that is known for working people hard and serving its clients well. On one project last year, my team members were being required to do a significant amount of work out of their job scope for several months. They were upset and overworked, so I raised the issue to my immediate bosses several times. They replaced me with someone else because they were tired of me complaining about the situation of my team members. 

I started wondering if consulting was right for me. I wondered if consulting itself, or maybe just my company, prioritized serving the client at the expense of a certain degree of team fairness/well-being. 

So, after I was removed from the project, I spoke to one of the company leaders, who I had worked with before and had a pretty good relationship with. Here was the exchange I'm wondering if I was the ass hole for:

I'm not saying one value/priority is better than the other, but mine is with the team first. In your experience, is that specific to my team, or common in consulting in general and/or this company? I guess I ask because I didn't hear from anyone from the company any acknowledgment of what I was trying to do to protect the team, even if I didn't do it in a way that was liked/effective.""

**Her:** (getting upset)  ""Ok...I can see why you think that...but you're flat wrong. Don't start judging a whole company everyone based on one thing. People take those accusations very seriously. It sounds like you're saying we don't give a fuck, and I'd be very careful talking like that if I were you.""

**Me:** ""Ok, thank you. I guess, if I slightly challenge that, I'm not sure what to do when I see something happening like that. I was confused why there weren't more alarms from leadership when the team was in that situation. I'm not sure how to, how would I bring this up in a way that's ok?

She stayed pretty stern and just told me to stick to facts, revert back to my immediate leadership, and be very careful talking about firm values. I felt really small and like I screwed up her support for me.

Part of me thinks: ""Jeez, she's so great and respected, and I must be way out of line."" The other part is more cynical.

AITA: Text Fail With GF,"My GF has been dealing with a drinking problem, owing to some serious trauma in her past. She's been up front and open about it from the start, but it's been a lot to handle, particularly whenever we go out to eat. I've offered to not drink in front of her for the time being and not go to restaurants that serve alcohol. But she's told me that just because she can't drink doesn't mean I should feel I can't, and that she wants to try new foods and be able to go to places with me. Today she suggested that we go for late night bowling or out to eat so she can meet my best friend who just got back into town. I hesitated, because she's been triggered in both spots, not being to stop crying in the bowling alley because of her anxiety and trying to cope with sobriety. Last time we went downtown she made us leave two different restaurants because she didn't like the vibe, and when we did find a spot she ordered a glass of wine after I pleaded with her not to. She didn't end up drinking it but then could barely look at me for the rest of the night, like she completely disconnected and wasn't really there. It was scary to see. With all this in mind, and remembering how she's been telling me all week how exhausted she's been because of work I didn't think going out for a late night was a good idea. I texted her, ""I need to do some work tonight, and after the week you've had I think it'd be best for you to rest. We could Prime (Amazon Prime watch party) if you'd like."" I will be the first to admit that was poor wording from me and would naturally come off as me telling her what to do and mansplaining to her. That was not my intention, but I very much understand how it would be read that way and acknowledge it was a mistake. She was understandably upset with that, ""Well I don't really need you to tell me what is good for me and I am trying to make time for you and I wouldn't suggest it if I was that beat, but fine. Forget it.""

I tried explaining that I didn't intend to tell her what to do but was concerned that the last two times we'd gone out after she worked a full day she ended up getting triggered, having bad anxiety, telling me that she was exhausted and ended up in tears both nights. I told her that I didn't want to see her struggle like that or have a borderline dissociative episode like that night downtown. That didn’t land either “I can just spend it with somebody who actually wants to hang out with me. You can have a pleasant f\*\*\*\*\*\* Sunday without whatever f\*\*\*\*\*\* dissociative, triggered attitude you think I'm going to bring to the table."" I haven't responded to that because I honestly don't know what to say and felt that anything I did was just going to make it worse. My first text wasn’t great, but I'm also hurt by what she said at the end. I struggle with my own anxiety and depression, and I've spent the entire evening feeling like the lowest piece of trash.

AITA For standing up to a School coach?,"FC: Fired Coach  AC: A-hole coach ME: Me

Backstory: This coach , along with another coach who was eventually fired , were straight up bullies towards the kids they were responsible for. The one who was fired bullied students and made it hard for us for no reason. 

He made fun of a kid who had a kidney disease for asking to not participate in dodge ball because he was having kidney problems. He also made him sit out that day of PE and didn't even allow him to go to the nurse. He later made fun of the same kid for not having a dad. (The kid's dad had died in the military.) After the FC made him sit out , he talked to him for a bit. The situation escalated like this. FC: I'm going to need you to get your dad to sign a note. Kid: I Don't have a daddy. FC: What? Excuse me? Kid: My dad died. FC: HAH! Alright sure , get your MOM to sign this then. (Then commences to lecture him on how he shouldn't lie and how he should respect the coach. Kid is crying at this point and FC gets even angrier.

After this incident me and my friend group were plotting to beat the FC up. Before we could set the plan into motion though , my friend apparently told his grandma everything who then went to the principle and got him fired. That was at the end of that year , so naturally we assumed that we would get a replacement coach, Since there was supposed to 2 because these coaches had to supervise 4 classes , but we ended up only having 1 coach despite the 4 classes. Enter AC. He hadn't been hostile or unfair to us the year before , despite going along with FC's actions. We quickly realized that he wasn't as bad , but he still bullied us. Sorry for the long setup , so here's the story I wanted to tell. It happened around the same time as our school's Christmas play. It had rained outside and they were practicing for the play in the gym , so we just sat in the gym and were told not to talk or get up. So basically this won't make sense unless I explain how we were seated. The boys were next to the girls on the bleachers , only separated by the stairs leading up the bleachers and a wooden fold up table place on the bottom of the stairs. I Had my water bottle with me and was taking a sip every once in a while. Fast forward about 10 minutes and I Had my water bottle sitting by my leg , I moved my foot slightly and accidently knocked it over so I went to pick it up and this girl picked it up and put it on the table. (Quick backstory on this girl: She is a bitch to everyone who isn't a teacher , enough said.) I said , ""hey give that back."" , then she replied , ""You shouldn't have dropped it."". I Then get up and go pick up the water bottle , just as the coach turns around. ""You aren't supposed to get up , go to the top of the bleachers."" AC said. I Didn't think that I had to , since I did nothing wrong. I Replied , ""I Was just getting my water."" At this point all 4 grades were looking at us , ""You still aren't supposed to get up , now go to the top."" he said. ""I don't need to because I did nothing wrong, SHE moved my water."" , I said pointing at the girl. ""Either go up there , or go to the office."" . he said , but I stood my ground because I HATE this coach. I Said , ""Ok , I'll go."" , In the most calm voice I could muster. I Got up and pushed myself under the table and onto the floor without falling and began to walk away. A few people clapped and others complimented me. Now I know that sounds like something strait out of a tumblr story but It actually happened. I Went to the office , explained the situation to the vice principal , who then called my mom and let me explain it to her. We both then went to see the coach , because by the time I was done in the office PE had ended for the day. When talking to the vice principal ,AC lied stating that I didn't say anything about my water bottle. When we left on the way back to the office I explained that AC was lying , but they ended up trusting the coach. The Vice principal and my mom agreed that I wasn't in trouble , but that I should've made a better attempt to tell the AC about my water bottle. In the end , what got me in trouble at home was the fact that I legit forgot to tell my dad about it. When he calmed down though he agreed that I wasn't in the wrong. (He was a bit flustered because I don't usually get in trouble.)Also ,(The same day) In class when I was talking to friends they were all congratulating me on what it did. So , Am I the asshole for standing up to a coach?

AITA for missing my friend’s baby shower?,"Hey all,

I guess I just need to ask this cause it’s bothering me a lot. It’s a throwaway for privacy reasons. 

For context, I suffer from persistent depressive disorder. I have random times of feeling very down about myself in lengths of time that ranges from one day to a few months. I’ve done a lot to improve on my mental health and I’m normal outside of these bad periods. That being said, I also haven’t been the most open person about this to one of my best friends. It’s not because I don’t care to tell, it’s just a very deep emotional wound for me to talk about. Plus, she has also gone through a loss of someone close to her, and I don’t want to have her worry for me causing more stress. 

She invited me to her baby shower a couple of months ago. My mind was already slowly going down the rabbit hole during then and I felt it. And I told her the typical excuse of how I’m not too sure if I’ll make it cause I’d be “busy” but if I can, I will drop by. And unfortunately during the few weeks leading up to the baby shower, I was in a really dark place. The last thing I wanted to do was go and then bawl my eyes out randomly because I probably would. It’ll ruin everything. And when I’m in that dark place, I really isolate myself. So I didn’t message her that I wasn’t coming (I had thought I already confirmed I wasn’t) or follow up with her on her pregnancy. I didn’t message anyone when I didn’t have an emergency or obligation. It wasn’t personal at all. 

I totally understand that she feels like I don’t care but I really care a lot. It’s just hard to care for others when I don’t even care for myself. It’s on me for not telling her about my deep problems but part of the anxiety in me is fear of sharing it. 

So fast forward now to maybe a few weeks after the baby shower, I reach out now that I’m in a better place mentally. She ignores me. I feel guilty and hence I start opening up on why and giving her context and letting her know I’ll be here. She deserves to know and I mustered up the courage to let her know my real problems. And that I understand she is angry but I’d still love to make amends and make it up to her. I explained my side and finally told her why and how it wasn’t intentional, that I don’t want to be like this. 

She then accuses me of being a bad friend, being one-sided, and how she doesn’t care about me anymore. It really hurt me a lot. I’ve gone through thick and thin with her and though my actions might have hurt her, it was never intentional. I just wished she tried to understand where I was coming from of all people. 

I just wish that she didn’t assume the worst of me from one mistake when I’ve spent a lot of time giving her the best of me.

AITA in all of this? She still ignores me and I just want to communicate. I know she had been through a lot during my absence but I want to show effort since I have the capacity to now.",No A-holes here
AITA for being pissed at my dad after he threw a fit?,"

Hello again reddit. Last time I was here I complained about my mother's and my relationship. This time I'm here to talk about my father. This happened just last week and I can't seem to get out of my mind. 

My(15f) parents (38m and 38f) relationship has been a bit rough these past couple of days. They still very much love each other and there are no signs of divorce or anything jurassic but they have been arguing alot.  And last time they argued my dad took it too far. I was upstairs playing games on my pc while my sister (11f) was in hers.

 My parents went out to get supplies for a event we had the next day. I wasn't sure what happpend but my mom returned home by herself. She was pulling out supplies when she turned to me and said ""Papi is walking home. He jumped out of the car at the drive thru and told me he was walking home after a arguement"" 

I was shocked and she told me she had to leave again. There was one more place she needed to stop by. So she left again. She brought us food but I ate it so fast out of stress eating. Something about my dad is that he is narcissistic. He thinks he's indestructible but I know he isn't and yes our neighborhood is very good but my anxiety went throught the roof. 

I opened our garage and waited for him. After 10 mins I broke down Panicking. I wanted to leave to go look for him, I knew the general area of where he could be, but my sister was home and I knew I couldn't leave. I broke down crying pacing the garage and after another 20 mins he got home. I ran into his arms and hugged him. Then told him how stupid he was. Hers how the convo went. 

""NEVER do that again you had me worried"" keep in mind I'm still bawling my eyes out

""Worried? About what it's me we are talking about cmom"" he said with a chuckle

""YOU NEVER FUCKING KNOW PAPI"" at this point I'm shouting

""(my name) you are crying for nothing"" He said at this point laughing. 

I told him I can't stand to look at him and ran upstairs. 

I can't forgive him. I've never felt fear like that before in my life. The next two days I gave him a bit of a cold shoulder and my moms telling me it's not my battle and I should forgive him and I'm being a jerk for holing a grudge that isn't mines.

AITA - gave employee a yearly rewiev under false premitions,"On mobile, non-english speaker, sorry for any flaws.

I’m a manager at a company with 50-isch employees. Me and two other managers. I manage three teams of 8-9 people, one of them beeing ”Mike”, 52m. 

What we do at our firm don’t matter here, but it is highly skilled and very well paid. Training a new employee takes more than a year and is very expensive.

Mike joined us three years ago. Good impression, great feedback from former managers. Started off well, but the past year things have taken a turn. He’s sloppy, slow and the quality isn’t up to standard, so his colleagues have to lend a hand. He’s not taking part in meetings, logging in late and going home early. He doesn’t answer calls or e-mails. Rude to co-workers nad management, told anothee manager to ”fuck off” and got written up. I’ve repetedly askes but Mike says he’s got no problems, no illness, no substance abuse.

We do two products, one rather easy and quick and one that requires time and skill. Important for later.
Two weeks ago was Mikes yearly rewiev. We have a system where you’re rewieved on 1. teamwork and taking responsibility, producing good quality etc. 2, the number of ”quick” products you do and 3, the number of ”quality” products you do.

Check one box - get a slight raise. Two -bigger raise. Etc. Everyone gets a raise equal to inflation, even if no boxes are checked. 

I got handed the production stats for Mike from our budget guy ”Paul”. Mike started our meeting bragging about how many products he makes and he should get a good raise. I look at the numbers and Mike haven’t done even half of his requirements. Poor quality, and as stated a horrid behaviour. So no raise above the inlation mark.

Mike breaks down and admitts he’s an alchoholic. Drinks every day, even at work. Wife left him cause of it a few months ago. With everything in the open, we talk and long story short he’s now in rehab and then couples therapy that we pay for. He’d on paid leave.

This weak I check the numbers Paul gave me. He did it wrong; Mike is in fact one of the most productive teammembers. Still bad quality and team-work, but he would have been up for a much higher raise had I known.

I decided to not say anything. This reality-check actually helped Mike out, big time. He will get a raise when he’s back at work.

Told my wife and she thinks I’m an a-hole. He did what he had to do to get a raise, and I’m decieving him from his pay raise.

AITA for telling my kids to stop complaining about their childhoods on FB?,"I've seen a lot of narc mom validation posts on here...and I hope this isn't one.

I had my twins when I was 17. I dropped out of school and moved in with a friend who was helping me support them-no rent. I got a job, earned my GED, and over the next few years I started college and got another job to pay for it. For most of their early childhood, I worked two or three jobs and took classes at a community college. Some bad events took place at my friend's house and I was forced to move into an apartment. Good news? A classmate with a boy my girls' age was looking for a place, so we became roommates and kinda co-parents. Worked great, we lived together until I was almost out of uni.

Still working two jobs, I usually had night and early morning shifts and she had day shifts. Someone was always with the kids, and when she started working more we got a babysitter. At this point we were still very poor-we wore bras and underwear with holes in them because we didn't have money for new ones. She got engaged, moved in with the guy, and I was forced to find a cheaper apartment I could make on my own. I graduated, got work as a bookkeeper in a legal office, and started earning enough to confidently stay afloat and afford a reliable babysitter. We stayed in the apartment until my kids had moved out and I saved enough to move to a house in a small town (years later).

Now, my girls are posting mean spirited comments on FB and complementing each other. One will post something about 'I didn't know how poor I was until I realized how big a yard can be' and the other one will say 'I always knew, other kids with competent mothers had huge backyards and we had an apartment'. Complaining about yards, being 'raised by babysitters', always moving...I got sick of it. I replied on one of their posts saying they always had a safe home with food and at least one adult around to protect them which is more than other children and they shouldn't be whining like this when they were competently cared for. My daughter deleted it, and some friends have pointed out that growing up poor still isn't easy and they were likely bullied and felt some uncertainty for the future. I've been told a good mother would let them vent now so they can come to terms with their past. While I see the reason, I also feel calling me incompetent as a mother is mean and uncalled for.

Edit: I should have put this in long before now, but the ""bad events"" at my friend's place had nothing to do with my kids. My friend's parents had serious health and financial problems and could no longer house me for free. The rent they needed to supplement lost income was too high, so I had to leave so they could rent to someone else.

Also, thanks to everyone who left advice. I was expecting a lot of YTA, but I was surprised by the direction they're taking. It's opening my eyes to this, and I know I have to actually talk to my children about this. I'll try and handle it better than I have so far.

AITAH for being touchy with my friends when I have a boyfriend ?,"Okay for context, I’m 15 almost 16F dating my bf 16 almost 17M for around 8 months now. We’ve been friends for years before we started dating. We’re both Mexican but I was born and raised in Mexico before I moved to the United States while he’s a third generation immigrant so I speak Spanish and was raised with the culture while he was raised in America with Mexican family. Growing up I’ve always been a very affectionate person. I love to hug people I’m close to, and in Mexico and Spain, it’s a custom to kiss on the cheek as a greeting. As a culture we tend to be pretty touchy people in general and especially in my family I was raised as physical touch as the primary love language. So here’s where I think I may be the ass hole. Prior to me dating my current boyfriend, I’ve always been really touchy with my friends. Hugs, cuddles, forehead kisses, etc etc. So when we started dating, I honestly didn’t think anything of it especially because I’ve always been this way in front of him with other friends prior to us dating (while I had another boyfriend). And I’m only this way around my girl friends and it’s never meant anything to me except a platonic way of me showing my love to the people I’m close to. A few months back I hung out with some friends without my boyfriend and recently he let me know the way that I was touchy with my friend made him upset. I hadn’t even considered how this could’ve made him upset because it’s always been something that’s so normal to me and I know this sort of thing varies from culture to culture. I never intended to hurt him and I explained that to him and he was deeply understanding and told me it would just take him time to get used to it.  Up until that point we’d mainly just hung around each other so we’d never been on that situation before which is why it came up. But I’m starting to think I may be the ass hole because I struggle so much to give that form of affection up with my friends. And It’s never anything that I haven’t or wouldn’t have done with my close family members so am I the ass hole?

(He knows I’m posting this btw)

UPDATE: Me and my boyfriend talked about things and turns out the issue DOESNT have much with me being touchy at all. It was more specific to the person from the specific instance. They used to have a thing and they had a bad falling out so he’s been weary of her every since so his opinion toward her isn’t the most favorable and he said it spiked unreasonable jealousy in him.

I said “I know mom, but I really am not ready to talk to you about what’s going on” I said in a soft sad tone, as we talked she was getting really impatient and angrier then from how she was before, at some point She said “well then we’re gonna have to get you back to school and with a therapist because I have done everything to help you and nothing seems to work”, her knowing perfectly well that I left school because of the constant bullying I got, ( I am being homeschooled right now.) I told her that everything will pass and that I will get better again, she said “well you don’t seem to understand how all of this makes me feel” pointing out me laying in bed tired from being woken up, after she left, she stormed out of the house with my little brother.

WIBTA if I missed part of my girlfriend's senior year to travel and live my life?,"I (17F) am in Grade 12 and am set to graduate at the end of this year. My girlfriend (16F) is in the grade below me at a different school. We've only been together 3 months, but we've been friends and ""talking"" for a lot longer than that. 

I've had ambitions of travelling and going out to live my life since I was young. I love my independence, I don't like feeling like someone else is controlling my decisions and whereabouts. So next year, when I'm fresh out of my school, my goals are to travel for months on end, meet new people, immerse myself in a new culture and maybe live there etc. However, my girlfriend will still be back in my hometown, living her senior year. 

Now the problem, when I told her about all of these plans she got upset, very upset. She got the most frustrated she's ever been with me. She asked me what about her? She said that she wanted me to be there for her birthday and graduation.

I said if I happen to be in hometown then of course I will be, but if the group of friends I want to travel with plan's line up with those dates, or if i have to leave straight away for border reasons, or if it's the best time to travel, then I can't make any promises.

From my perspective, I communicated this, and I didn't make any promises I'm not sure if I can keep. I can see why she's upset. She said that I'll have her for all of my senior year, but she won't get to have me for hers.

I've spoken to my bestfriend about this and she says I'm 100% in the right. And that I shouldn't put my life on hold for someone else's high school. But my Mum says just to say I'll be there. 

Im very open to criticism. I'm happy to admit I'm wrong and happy to admit I might have been the a hole. But here, I just don't understand. In her position, I'd be sad, but I'd want her to go live her life and see the world!

But also she brought up this fight out of no where. It's just on year, and I know shell be pissed at me the whole time I'm travelling. I'm saying to just take it day by day. We live 5 minutes away qnd nothing is set in stone, so let's enjoy the time we have. She said this is all she could think about. AITA?

AITA for falling asleep on my friend?," I (24f) have been friends with ""Tiffany"" (25f) for about ten years now.

The two of us randomly met online on a website and started chatting. 

We share everything with each other and I would like to think that our friendship is healthy. We don't judge each other, we always come to each other first when something bad or good happened in our lives, we have amazing communication and share a lot of interests and hobbies. 

I'd like to think everything is good between us, but here's why I think I might be an a\*hole: During our usual chatting time (4 to 10 PM her time, because she lives in America, and 10 PM to 4 AM my time because I live in Europe) I kept falling asleep on her. I would randomly fall asleep while waiting for her to reply because I'm genuinely exhausted, only to wake up later to see she had replied a while ago. 

With my classes starting again I also had to get a new sleeping pattern which looks as follows; I wake up around 8 or 9 AM and go to my class. I stay awake most of the day and take a nap if I'm too exhausted. If I'm really busy though I don't have the time to do so, which leads to me getting tired around the time I start chatting with her. We chat until our time is up and then I go to bed and repeat the cycle again.

I try my best to stay awake during our chats, but on some days I just start drifting off.

Usually Tiffany is extremely understanding about this happening. She always assures me not to worry, that she knows I'm exhausted from the chores I have to do around the house and the classes I take at college.

A couple days ago it happened again.

I fell asleep on her for an hour and started apologizing for dropping without warning. This time she wasn't understanding. She didn't sound upset or mad, but she didn't sound like her usual self either.

She simply told me ""I'm used to you falling asleep on me by now, so I figured that happened again.""

Something about this statement just felt off to me. As if she was hurt by my actions (which she would have every right to), but she kept assuring me that I didn't do anything wrong.

Tiffany never called me an a\*hole for any of this. My friends and family also tell me that being exhausted with my (admittedly) horrible sleeping schedule is perfectly normal and that I might be overthinking this.

Still, something about how Tiffany wrote that sentence just gives me an uneasy feeling. 

I'm scared of losing my friend due to this behavior of mine. I already tried fixing it, but I still want to make sure that I didn't turn into a toxic friend, who is taking her friend for granted. If I did, I want to at least catch myself and change while I still have the chance. I don't want to lose her, so I'm asking you guys for an objective judgement.

AITA for not paying my parents rent?,"My (23f) parents have always told me I am welcome here and wouldn’t have to worry about paying rent to live at home, as I should be saving up for my own home while I’m here (up until a reasonable age of course.) 

Recently my mom has presented the idea of me paying rent because my parents are tight on bills, which I wholeheartedly understand but I do not agree with. I just got into a car accident, so I have no transportation and I’m saving for a new car. And I’m also going to finish school (which was interrupted due to covid.) I’m also desperately trying to move out, because quite frankly, my house is disgusting. I do my fair share of cleaning, but it’s beyond Dawn Powerwash. There’s been a hole in my bathroom ceiling for the past 2 years because my dad tried to “fix a leak” (yes it is still leaking), we have a mouse problem, it smells like dog pee all the time, and I just don’t want to pay rent to live someone where where the landlords can’t fix anything, even if they are my parents. Everything in the house is grimy, cluttered, and my mom refuses to actually start throwing stuff away that she doesn’t need. If I would have known they would start charging me this soon, I would have made my financial decisions much differently. But in my area, it’s nearly impossible to afford a place without a roommate or making 3x the rent. The conversation with my mom wasn’t heated, but I certainly did express my concerns. I don’t want to feel like the freeloading child (which I am not when I’m actively trying to get my life together and move out, but my brother (21m) has no plans or intentions on moving out) but i am not planning on staying here when I am financially in a place to leave. Am I in the wrong for thinking this way?

EDIT: my parents are not poor. They will not lose the house or anything else. I pay ALL my own bills already. And they don’t want me to HAVE to pay rent, and they are not kicking me out because of that.

EDIT#2: this was a PROMISE, and includes not paying utilities, trash, etc because I was expected to be saving. They were especially promising of this BECAUSE i was going to school full time and knew I would need time to pay off student loans, find a job, etc. I would have never came home or went to a 4 year university had I not had this option. Also, my parents are bringing up struggling AFTER my dad doubled his salary, DIRECTLY after my accident and DIRECTLY after I mentioned I am going back to finish school. I am grateful for my parents, but a promise that I made my life plans around was broken, and the timing of this seems really off to me.",No A-holes here
AITA for getting upset about my husband eating the last egg?!,"I am 15 weeks pregnant and still have this nagging nausea every day. The only meal I can stomach at the moment is eggs and rice. I told my husband yesterday that I was worried that we only had 3 eggs left and he said he would go to the store and get more. Next morning, he wanted to tell me about this wonderful breakfast he made for himself (English muffin, 3 eggs and ham). Without thinking,  I’m like “that’s great babe, sounds good, glad you liked it” meanwhile he is working all day. I get hungry finally and for the first time I can’t wait for the eggs and rice. I open the fridge and the eggs are not where they usually reside in the fridge. 
Me: babe did you seriously eat all of the eggs 
Him: yeah I told you about my breakfast 
Me: I told you that’s the only meal I can eat right now and I was worried about the eggs running out! 
Him: oh sorry

AITA for not reaching out to my depressed friend when I'm depressed too?,"I (27F) have two close long-distance friends, R and S. Almost a year ago I escaped an apartment fire, but I lost everything, including my cat. I struggle with moderate depression and he wasn't registered as an emotional support animal but he pretty much fit the bill. My mental health has been a roller coaster since then with a big increase in depressive spirals.

4 months ago R told us her dad, with whom she already has a strained relationship, was diagnosed with prostate cancer, that she was seeing a therapist, and may be distant for awhile. From previous discussions I know that R, unlike me, does *not* like to talk about her feelings. She's complained about her husband, in-laws, and other friends trying to pressure her into talking when she'd rather be left alone, so I sent her a message that said ""I won't call because I know you need space, but I want you to know that you can call me anytime."" A month later she let us know that they were able to contain and start treating her dad's cancer, and that therapy was going well.

Cut to now, R and I had been working on a pro-bono project together, but I’d been falling behind trying to keep up with my full-time, pretty high-stress job in between depressive episodes. I finally sent her a text explaining that I dropped the ball, apologized, and asked if she wanted to schedule a call about it. No response. I later sent a text in our group chat asking if they'd like to get together. I got a nasty text back from R saying that she wasn't interested in seeing me because she'd been depressed for awhile and I would know this if I ever bothered to reach out. Quiet stretches are normal for our group so I was pretty shocked. I went back through my messages and it seemed typical for us, a few spurts of conversation every month or so, and one prior attempt from me to get together.

I texted R privately to apologize for not reaching out. I said that I had been trying to give her space and hadn't realized she had been feeling ignored (true, but it's not like I was righteously considering her needs the whole time, I was also busy being in my depressed hole). I said I would check in more regularly if she needed. I got an immediate text back saying things like ""I took your silence as a sign"" and ""It doesn't really seem like you care unless the situation revolves around you. I was there for your crisis, but you weren't there for mine"".

I called S, worried that maybe she was feeling neglected too. I did my best not to divulge R’s private texts, but she had obviously seen the first text in the group chat. She also let slip that at some point R and S got together, the subject of me came up, and ""R was feeling a certain way"". I feel like there's a bit of a double standard here. Maybe I didn’t reach out enough, but I can't know what R needs if she doesn't tell me. And R *was* there for me after the fire, but my trauma doesn't just go away because she’s hurting too.

AITA for snapping at my brother?,"The title somewhat sums it up but I’ll give details

So me (17m) and my brother (12m) aren’t exactly in the best relationship. We argue, we fight, sometimes even get into screaming matches but thankfully nothing physical, at least we agree on that.

My brother has always seemed to dislike the stuff I like mostly for reasons I don’t understand, every time I say get my rollerblades on when walking the dog, he grunts at me or flat out tells me “don’t bring your rollerblades” even though he never explains why. Or whenever we decide to play a game of MTG commander, he always gets so annoyed or even angry whenever I so much as start getting the upper hand. He used to be very snoopy, although the last time I caught him trying to break into my phone or enter my room was 2 years ago so I’m not as angry about that. He also always thinks my friends (which are mostly online) and even my lover are fakes and lying to me without any proof or reasons, whenever I tell him he’s being dismissive he tells me “deal with it”

What’s mainly important is when we walk together, him and I both walk to school at the same time, and most of the time we “talk”. However he always starts rambling about anime which he knows I don’t like, whenever he asks why I don’t like it or don’t wanna watch it I usually give him the same reasons, typically one of which is because he keeps spoiling it for me, but then he goes back to rambling anyway and then complains whenever I wanna put music in, and even tells me “do you even care?” When I try and change the subject or try to bring up something I know we both like.

Here’s where I might be a**hole. Today I couldn’t take anymore of him being dismissive (or at least I think so) and snapped at him during our walk to school today, calling him out for talking constantly about stuff he knows I don’t like, being dismissive of my likes and friends, and overall just being a jerk. He fell silent and started to cry, calling me an uncaring brother and telling me I’m the only person he can talk to, I brought up his friends at school (he talks to them online after school), and he said “they aren’t always on” and kept going off on me about how I don’t care, that I’m a bad brother, that all I do is hate him, etc. we didn’t talk for the rest of the walk.

AITA? I love my brother still, we wouldn’t talk or play MTG together otherwise, but I felt like this needed to be addressed, if I’m wrong please put me in my place",No A-holes here
AITA for not telling my boyfriend that I used to post videos of me and my ex on Pornhub?,"My boyfriend (both 20, been together around six months) and I were getting drunk together on Zoom last night and playing a good-natured game of truth or dare. For my truth, he asked me if I would ever post/send nudes to make money and I said ""Hell yeah! I already have actually..."" He thought I was fucking with him at first, but when I told him I was serious he kinda freaked out and asked me what I posted, what type of posts, etc.

I explained to him that my ex and I used to post videos of us having sex on Pornhub to help him pay his tuition and for his mom's chemo. All the videos were amateur and anon and none of our faces were ever in them. We developed a pretty popular profile and some of our videos racked up close to one million views. My boyfriend was shocked speechless at this point and kept asking me if I was joking, and because I was drunk I just kept going and trying to over-correct (I knew I was digging myself a hole, but I just kept talking). I told him we only did it for about a year and after we broke up, he deleted all of the videos from our account. My boyfriend asked me if I was forced into doing it for his pleasure/gain and I said no, I really enjoyed it. I really did not see a problem with it at the time—and I still don't—since I was so in love with him, we had a phenomenal sex life, I liked being filmed, and I was helping my him pay for college.

Well, my boyfriend did not take to that well at all despite me reassuring him that I was always anon, the videos are deleted, and that I no longer film myself. He looked literally heartbroken and said that he was really upset and needed time to process this. He also asked why I didn't tell him earlier to which I responded that I didn't think it was something that I needed to disclose, but that I never tried to intentionally keep it from him. He then just hung up on me and texted me that he needed time. I respect that and left him alone.

He texted me this morning telling me he thinks he failed his midterm because he couldn't concentrate. That really hurt me because now I think it's my fault. I just really did not expect him to get that offended. He's definitely a fair share more conservative (raised in a very religious family) than the other guys I've dated, but our values and beliefs align on the biggest issues and we've never had a problem with it before. I don't know...AITA?

WIBTA if I changed my name without my Guardians knowledge?,"Hi Reddit, 

Long time lurker first time poster and obligatory mobile formatting.

I (f17) have hated my name my whole life. It’s an extremely common name and I feel as though I don’t identify with it, it just doesn’t feel like my name. Sure, when someone says my name, I answer, but when introducing myself and saying my name, it just feels wrong. 

I’ve wanted to change my name my whole life, there have been three names that I’ve wanted to change to when I was younger, but haven’t thought about the name change for a while.

Where I am to change your name you must give your birth certificate and be over 18 (without parental signature). Now my parents for my life havent been very good parents, sure they pay for my education and food, but after that they weren’t very kind to me and have been very unsupportive all round, they have also been quite mean and just without going into it weren’t the best parents. Another reason I want to change my name is that I don’t want to identify with the name they chose for me, because of how they have treated me.

When I was around 12 I brought up the idea of changing my name (not legally or permanently at all just an idea) and they were very against it.

So I’m thinking when I turn 18 I change my name, but if I ask them and they refuse to give me my birth certificate this could be a hard battle.

My idea is when I turn 18 I go and legally change my name, and I honestly probably won’t tell them, or if I do it will be after I have moved out, I can live with having them call me my birth name, at least temporarily so long as I can live with everyone else calling me my chosen name.


Here’s where I believe I may be the a hole, I’d be taking my birth certificate without their knowledge and changing my legal name without their knowledge, after all I am still their daughter and still technically “theirs” to name. I feel as though it may not be my right to change my name and that may be the a hole move 


I’d be happy to answer any questions if this wasn’t clear enough!

AITA For Buying An Expensive Gift And Then Finding Out Nobody Wanted It?,"So, my brother is getting his diploma from university. 9 people and I wanted to buy him something nice. 

After 20 days, I decided to do a polling. 3 people voted for Playstation VR, 3 people voted for Remarkable 2, 2 people voted for a new phone and one persone voted for ""choose something else"".

So, to avoid being stuck, I asked the 2 people who voted for the phone to vote for something else. They voted for the VR. So, understandably, I bought the VR from Gamestop for $300. Mind that we need this before 2nd October.

I thought that the VR would be a great gift for a gamer. I tried to understand whether he would actually like it or not, but it wasn't that obvious one way nor the other.

However, two days later, the person who voted for ""choose something else"" wrote ""Are we really sure about the VR? Should we keep looking for something else just in case?"".

Now everybody is unsure about the VR and I look like an a-hole. I almost got a VR in my house and nobody really wants it.

I am stuck like this. I think I could have got the gift a bit later, but how was I supposed to know?

TL;DR: 5 out of 9 people agreed to buy a VR for my brother's diploma. 2 Days later, after I bought the gift, turns out nobody wants the VR to be the gift.

AITA - I won’t let my mom talk to her toxic boyfriend,"Ok so let’s start off by saying it’s been a hell of a week! 

Sorry more to this story but character count... 

So I get a call from my brother that my moms in the ICU and might die! Something along the lines of “moms in the hospital, something to do with an OD but her boyfriend also didn’t call 911 from 2am -11am.”

I live in Oregon my mom lives in Arizona.

I call both her phone and her boyfriends hoping my brother had it wrong but nope. the crazy boyfriend ends up calling me back. He starts out the call saying he didn’t call me because my mom made him take my phone number out of his phone because she didn’t trust him with it. odd! But okay. he then says that he heard her fall at 2am and he found her unresponsive. He couldn’t pick her up he is like late 60s she is 56 so he pulled her to bed room by the arm and left her next to the bed. He said it sounded like she was snoring! he was yelling and shaking her and not getting a response.

so he treated her for shock!

He gives a list of drugs they have at the house almost a brag. Like I think that shits cool what a fucking absolute idiot!!!! He says he stashed them instead of handing them off the medics!!

Then he proceeds to rambling about Montana and all sorts of crazy garble about his good ol days. I quickly get off phone with him. 

When I get to Hopistal I thought she was gonna die but luckily she pulled through but not before almost losing her kidneys having rabdo which is when your muscles start breaking down do to lack of oxygen and send toxins into body. Flash pulmonary edema where her lungs filled with fluid and so on.
 He lives 30 minutes or so from hospital and didn’t come visit once!!!!!

So to try to make a long story short when I showed up there were three case workers who informed me that adult protective services where stepping in. And a protective order was going to be placed against him. 

Once mom finally comes to she says she wants to go home to Oregon with me......I extend my stay in AZ I’m now a couple grand deep on this trip!  

Soo here is the, am I an ass hole part!!?? 
We made it back to my place but she is in a fog and it’s like she has Alzheimers or dementia now.... mentioned memory lapse before we left hospital but they said it was sedation could last a week or so... I have had to relive her losing her mother about 10 times now and my father who passed away 4 months ago another 10 times or more. She is finally starting to remember those events happens but still a lot missing!

but now she wants to speck with the ex.. to find out what happened she is super confused and pretty much told me she had to ask him what she felt about the situation! 🤦‍♀️ my life right now!

So I refuse to let her talk to him she is now thinking I’m conspiring against her but yet happy to be here depending soon which wave we are in.

AITA asking my mom to stop telling me about my brother until I can process,"Ok, so my brother (28) got engaged to his fiancee (26) about 6 months ago, they are expecting in June, and they just bought a residential lot with two houses on it. My brother Shay's said he never wanted kids, but once they got engaged he said he now wants 2. They found out they were expecting after 3 months of just no birth control, not really trying. Their property came fully furnished with brand new items like a King sized bed and leather lay-z-boy furniture, and a Jacuzzi!

I am actually super happy for him that he has his shit together, isn't falling down the alcohol/drug hole that we were worried about happening, and seems to be genuinely happy. I would never wish for him to not have the amazing things in his life.

My life...is not in the best place right now. My DH (30) and I (30) had to sell my house and move in with my parents 4 years ago when we both lost our jobs due to the economy (1.5hrs from the city). We have our own area in the basement. 
2 years ago we gave birth to DD after struggling for 3.5 years to conceive!
In the last year DH has had 5 different jobs. DH now has a job in the city (2 months), and I work between three different communities (one in the city; 1 year). When we're working in the city we stay at the In-Laws place 20min outside the city. I sleep with DD on the 2nd floor across from MIL and FIL, husband sleeps in the basement with SIL (33) and BIL (29).  
Even though both DH and I are employed now (I'm casual right now, trying to get full-time permanent) we have such a debt load ($2000+/mnth) that it would be impossible for us to move out for another 4 years. 
We've been living pay cheque to pay cheque for 4 years now, but I am trying to figure out a financial plan that will help us move into our own place in about 4 years while putting money away for DD's future.

My mom has been telling me all these fantastic things going on in my brother's life, and while I am super excited for him, I am also sad that I feel like I'm drowning. My mom wanted to celebrate Christmas at his new house, meanwhile I had to scratch to try and get my daughter birthday/Christmas prrsents. So I asked my mom if she could try not to talk to me about it so much as I am trying to work through my issues. I reassured her that I am happy and excited for him, just really sad for me, but working through it.

My mom said she is disappointed in me not being able to just be happy for my brother. I won't go into the other points of the conversation, as I really just want to know: AITA?

AITA : Leaving kids in the car @ gas station,"

Parental dispute help here...... 

Caveat, I would NEVER leave my children in an unsafe environment EVER! But my wife insists that this situation is unsafe. I'll let reddit decide if I am an indeed an a**hole. 

On occasion, I will leave my 3 and 5 year old strapped in their car seats while I go inside to pay for gas and get snacks/coffee. I do ask my kids every time if they want to come in with me and they sometimes do, but most of the time they'd rather stay in the van to draw, color, or read. I'm fine with that choice. As most parents would tell you, getting into and out of car seats can be a hassle. 

When at our gas station, I always make sure....
-the kids are warned to stay strapped in their seats (they've never not heeded this warning).
-the van is off, and I have the keys
-the doors get locked 
-I'm at the nearest possible pump under the shaded awning
-I can see the van the whole time from the windows of the station.
-I'm inside 5 min. or less 
-the kids end up with a snack, too :). 

So is this a reasonable parenting practice or, as my wife sarcastically insists, CPS is going to start an investigation into my daddy decisions, and some bystander is going to call me an asshole for leaving my kids in the car. 

Am I an asshole?

Clarification: Several have asked...... I'm in Michigan, and I've never gotten back into the car after my 5 min. inside and the temperature had changed by more than a couple degrees inside the van (hot or cold). Also, if I see a huge line inside, I don't wait. 5 min. is the max I am away from the van.",No A-holes here
"WIBTAH If I asked to wipe the debt clean. (Repost, passed character limit)","Not really sure where to begin, so if this feels disorganized or rambly, my apologies. My bro and I (we twins) live with our Uncle and Aunt and their two toddler children. Back in 2019 my bro and I got ourselves fired stupidly from our job (totally our fault) and had some financial issues. We used as much of our savings to pay bills and tried looking for some good job opportunities. But when some jobs feel through and our savings dried up, we couldn't pay our bills. My uncle stepped up and helped us by paying for our bills. This came with the stipulation that we would pay him back when we could, which when we got jobs again, we started to do. However, when we paid more than half of it back, about 5kish, covid hit and we all got furloughed, my bro, uncle aunt and I. My uncle and aunt ended up getting called back to work but now needed babysitters again for their toddlers. Since with covid they didn't trust babysitters outside our bubble, smart, my bro and I stepped up and started babysitting. At first, we were more than happy to help out family and never expected any pay despite having to babysit 30ush hours a week. We thought we would babysit for a month or two and that's it, no big deal. I would also like to add that we stopped paying back what we owed shortly after getting furloughed since my bro and I are simply on unemployment now. However, it's now been nearly a year and we have been babysitting 30ish hrs a week nearly that whole time. I won't lie, it's been tough. Props to all the parents here on reddit but without shit like Masha and Bear or CocoMelon (it's like crack to kids), idk how we woulda done it, I'm not built for kids that's for sure haha. Don't get me wrong,  I'm still happy to help and my cousins are adorable and I've learned a lot about kids which is good. However, we've been babysitting this whole time no pay which I would still be okay with if it wasn't for my Uncle constantly reminding my bro and I of the money we owe him. I get it, we did say we would pay it back, I just think it's a little unfair how helping my bro and I comes with an IOU, while babysitting for them comes with nothing and it's saving them 1200 or more a month on babysitters, they told me how much a while ago. 

So dear reddit, tell me, would I be the ass hole for asking for the rest of the debt to be wiped clean, should I ask for pay continuing on, or what? Generally lost on this and have felt guilty about bringing the situation up with my Uncle when I was so irresponsible in 2019. So let me know what you guys think. 

Some info: we babysit 3 days a week and each of those days are about 8 hrs to 11 hrs of babysitting depending on my Uncle and Aunt's schedule. In all this time, we only missed one day of babysitting (got snowed in at a friend's house) resulting in Aunt having to call out. Other than that, we have been ready and available whenever their schedule calls for it.

Edit: to be clear, my bro and I pay all our bills and always have except for the period of time where our debt with Uncle accrued. Right now all bills are paid fairly and evenly since end of 2019.",No A-holes here
WIBTA If I Asked My Sisters To Help Me Pay For A Subscription Service?,"(Sorry in advance for any grammatical or spelling errors, English is my first language)

I'll keep this post short, sweet and directly to the point as possible.

So I (26, F) have two little siblings who are twins (20, F, F). I pay for Netflix and Disney+ and I've shared my login with my sisters so that way they can use my subscription. We've discussed them paying me for using the subscription, but I have told them, no, it's fine, they don't need to pay me anything and they can use the services for free. Of course we have an agreement set up where if I am going through any sort of financial crisis and can't afford to pay for the services that month, that I can give them a weeks notice, and then pause the subscriptions and reactivate them when I'm in a better spot. (That hasn't happened yet thankfully) Now to be honest, my sisters don't use Netflix and Disney+ as much as I do.

I'm also paying for one other subscription based service that the three of us end up using more frequently since we **L-O-V-E** video games and playing video games together. I have a Nintendo Switch Online account that I pay for a yearly subscription on. (The type that I have is $34.99 USD, last I checked.) Now that specific subscription bills directly on January 1st, right after the holidays. And I know right after the holidays money is tight for everyone.

Here's the thing, I told my sisters early on in 2020 that I didn't expect them to help me pay for the Nintendo Switch Online subscription service. However I am switching jobs as of right now because the department that I work in is shutting down at the end of November, and I'm not sure how well I'll end up doing at this new job / how long they may keep me.

Now here's where I think I could be the a\*\*hole. I was thinking of maybe asking my sisters if they'd be willing to help split the cost on that one subscription. I'd only ask for $10 each, while I pay $14.99. I am only thinking about this because I don't know what my financial situation will be in January and since all three of us actively use the service, is it fair to ask them to help pitch on just the one subscription service alone even though I previously told them I didn't expect them to help me? I haven't discussed this yet with my sisters.

I will accept whatever judgment comes my way.

**TLDR**: I pay for my sisters Netflix, Disney+ and Nintendo Switch Online. Is it fair of me or is it rude of me that I ask them to help pay for just one of the services since I'm switching jobs and the service bills right after the holidays?

&#x200B;

**Small Update**: So it's been a while since I last posted. Not that many people saw my original post but I have good news. I had a civil conversation with my sisters and they were very understanding of my situation and it was eventually decided that if things are still rough at the start of the new year, they would help out with the subscription to Nintendo. Thankfully, while it is difficult for me I am indeed doing well enough at my new job that I won't need their help to cover the next year of Nintendo service!",No A-holes here
AITA for not getting rid of my stim toy when my sister got scared by it?,"Sorry for formatting, am on mobile.


I (16M) am diagnosed autistic and have been for around ten years now. I’m currently living with my mom, stepdad, and two sisters who are 12 and 7.  The 7 year old is the only one referenced in this post, so we’ll call her M.

So because I am autistic, I get overwhelmed fairly easily and often have to do some form of stimming, such as flicking my hands or playing with a small toy, to calm down. Recently I found a weird squishy thing laying around the house that I really enjoy using. It’s one of those balls with holes in it and a sac of little colored balls that come out of the holes. I can’t paste a link here because of character limits, but just Google “orbeez mesh ball”. The thing is, it’s painted to look like some sort of green spider, and it’s got a fairly realistic spider body hanging off of it.

Now this wouldn’t be a big deal, but it is as we’re pretty sure M has a few issues of her own (she was in the process of being tested for autism as well but we have to wait due to COVID). Relating to that, she’s got a lot of anxiety about certain things. Mostly bugs.

... I’m sure you can see where this is going, right? Today, I had the spider thing laying on the couch next to me while I was doing schoolwork, which at times will leave me a bit overwhelmed if I get stuck, so I had it there for easy stim breaks. M came in, sat on the floor, and started watching TV. She didn’t notice the toy up until I started squeezing it. 

It makes a little noise when you squeeze it, so she heard it, looked over, saw only the spider body hanging out of my hand, and began crying and screaming for our mom (she’s usually the only one able to calm her during the meltdowns). Our mom came running in to comfort her and I got up with my stuff and left the room, because loud noises and shouting also overwhelm me and it was getting pretty loud in there.

Fast forward a few hours, my mom comes in my room and she’s clearly upset. I asked her what was wrong and she exploded about how I “purposely triggered my sister with a disgusting fake bug”. I didn’t even understand that she was talking about the spider toy until she grabbed it from my table and insisted that I give it up to her.

I basically told her, that’s mine and it helps me calm down. I forgot about M’s anxiety. I love my sister, I would have never done something on purpose to upset her. I won’t use it in the room with M again but no, you can’t take it from me. She yelled at me a bit for being “disrespectful”, but eventually left it when she saw I wasn’t going to give up my toy. 

It’s been another hour since, and her and my stepdad (who I assume was told the story by her) have both called me an asshole. My other sister (who heard it from me) said she doesn’t think I was an asshole per se, but I still should have just given it up.

AITA for not wanting to be reminded that I was born in Korea?,"First, I have absolutely nothing against Korea. It's a wonderful country with a lot of great people. I have grown up in a rural area in the U.S. all my life with my (American) family, who adopted me when I was four months old. I consider them my true family, though I wouldn't mind meeting my biological family someday. Anyways, in my area there are no people of Asian or Korean heritage, which makes me feel out of place at times. I have taken to thinking of myself as American now, because this country is my home and it helps me feel like I belong. My father, however, likes to remind me that I'm actually Korean, not out of any attempt to make me feel alienated but because he wants me to be proud of my heritage and where I come from. I get that, but it still bothers me because it makes me feel somehow different and weird compared to everyone else around me. I have told him that I'd prefer he not mention it, but he still does it and doesn't see why it bothers me so much.

I guess I'm wondering if maybe he's right and I'm being too petty about this. I want to feel that I actually belong somewhere and not feel like the weird one all the time, but maybe an outside opinion will help me put this issue in the proper perspective.

P.S. I have absolutely no information or contact about my biological family, so unfortunately I can't connect to them and feel like a part of their family. I also have done some reading about Korea and I do know there is absolutely nothing wrong with being Korean, but like I said, I feel like the odd one because of it.

Edit: I will try sitting down with my father and explaining my reasons, as you all have suggested. Thank you for the advise and support here. Perhaps he'll understand more with an actual conversation in contrast to just my telling him I don't like it.

Update: I sat down with my father yesterday and talked to him about him referencing my being born in Korea so much. He explained that while he and my adoptive family were living in Korea they got to know many Koreans (they were there for several years before moving to the U.S. when I was around one), and they became good friends with several of them. And that Korea is a very fine country and that there's absolutely nothing wrong with being proud of where I come from. I do understand all of that, but still am not comfortable being reminded of it, so I told him I'd rather it not be mentioned. He agreed and apologized for not heeding my previous requests. So I believe I was able to resolve this situation in a way that satisfies both of us.

Also, I do appreciate everyone not seeing my father as an A-hole. Like I said, he's not trying to alienate me or be mean in any way, he just wants me to know that there's nothing to be ashamed of in regards to my heritage.",No A-holes here
WIBTA for using a gift card at a local “mom and pop” restaurant just a week after it opened back up?,"I received a gift card to a local hole-in-the-walk “mom and pop” type restaurant back in Jan 2020. The gift card is enough to cover a decent meal for two at this place. 

Before I had a chance to use it, things went into lockdown and the restaurant has since been either closed, outdoor dining only with very limited capacity, or takeout only. 

Just last week things opened back up here at full capacity for the first time in nearly a year. 

Thing is, I know restaurants have been struggling, especially the smaller locally owned ones. WIBTAH if I used the gift card to pay for our meal when my spouse and I dine there this weekend?",No A-holes here
AITA for wanting to spend the day in my room in comfy clothes and while 8 months pregnant?,"We live in a multi-generational household so on the weekends everyone is home. I’m 8 months pregnant, already very uncomfortable as it is, so I try to do what I can to find comfort here and there. 

On the weekends I tend to spend a lot of time in our room because in here I can be bra-less, wear tanks, crop pants whatever. We’re conservative Hindus so this is not necessarily appropriate to do among the overall household but even if it was, I wouldn’t feel okay doing it.

My husband asked me to start spending the day downstairs on weekends because he thinks it’s not fair of me to be holed up all day and leave our toddler to him and his parents. He helps a lot with our toddler, he pointed out that he spends half the day with her on weekdays. Which is true. I’m responsible for her nap time, bath time, night time routine and bed time, but he gives her lunch, plays with her outside in the evenings. He is currently waiting for a new job to start and I have quite a bit of summer studying to get through as I’m a full time student, so this has been working for us the past few weeks. 

Today he asked me to stay downstairs on the weekends despite me being uncomfortable because he said it’s not a huge ask. And honestly it’s not, but I am big pregnant and uncomfortable. He wants me to especially be downstairs when his mom cooks on the weekends  because our toddler is really attached to her grandmother and gets in the way. I completely completely understand this and do what I can to keep our toddler away from my mil on the weekdays after she gets home. I’ve asked him all he has to do is bring her up here on the weekends, she has toys here and we play. I also have sciatica so when it flares up I try to avoid the stairs as much as possible, like today. And I was sick with covid for about 10 days through the end of May, so I still have random intermittent symptoms pop up.

I’m currently on summer break for another 3 weeks but am full time in a very rigorous professional degree program. I will be giving birth at the start of the semester and will not be able to take any time off. So I’m also just trying to relax as much as I can now because I know it won’t be possible later.

AITA for forgetting my friend is a vegan when eating pizza?,"Hi guys. So this happened 3-4 years ago but it came up tonight. When i was 14-15 ( i am now 19) i invited my best friend over and my mom had made pizza. She brought along my other best friend , her brother. For some reason i cant remember, he decided he was going to eat the crusts of the pizza bc hes vegan. My mom used to make the pizza dough with eggs in it, and I completely forgot at the time. He had just became vegan and we would sometimes forget. So he ate the pizza crusts and neither me nor his sister thought much of it bc we forgot there were eggs in the dough. A couple days later his sister and i got to talking and we realized that the dough at eggs. Now here’s where i accept we might have been the a**holes. We decided not to tell him bc hes a very petty person and as much as i love the guy, he holds a grudge like no one else. And we did not do it on purpose. 
A couple months ago we told him bc somehow the conversation led there and he was very mad at us but he decided to talk to us after a couple of days.
I told this story to my friend tonight and she says that we were the a**holes for forgetting he was vegan.

AITA in refusing his help unless he did it my way?,"I'm 33 weeks pregnant, a little hormonal and could quite possibly be the AH here, but I leave it to the unbiased world of Reddit to decide.

My husband and I are building a bed frame as we couldn't find anything we liked in the size we need. Between us both working and having an 18 month old at home, this has been in the works for a few months. We're running out of time before baby #2 gets here and had a few days to work on it.

Building was done and just had to assemble it.  I was drilling the holes in the frame and he was out in the garage cutting the pieces needed to support the mattress. When he was done he came in to see if I needed help, to which I said sure. I had drilled the pilot holes and was on to inserting the double sided screws (screw on one side, wingnut on the other) and was having a hell of a time.

It had taken me 5 screws and a bunch of time to figure out the settings on the drill so that it was powerful enough to sink them to the right depth, but not too powerful that it ruined/stripped the wingnut side threads. I stopped what I was doing, grabbed the drill and a screw and started to show him how I was getting it to work as needed. He interrupted saying that he'll figure it out, to which I responded that I already had worked out the kinks and this was what I had found worked best. He insisted that he'd do it his way, I'd insisted that I'm not giving him the drill and I'll do it myself if he won't even hear me out. It ended in a mini explosion resulting in me telling him to get out and leave me alone and him saying it was now my project and that I can finish it alone. He headed back downstairs and sat on his computer.

I continued to work on it, but it was slow going and being so far pregnant definitely didn't help. 2 hours after I had started (about an hour after he tried to help) I was done marking, drilling and sinking screws. The argument continued, and now we're not talking because he expects an apology to be the first thing I say to him.

I say that he could have at least heard me out, instead of disrespecting me by brushing me off because ""he's been using tools longer thank I have"" and not at least considering trying what I had already been doing. He says I disrespected him by refusing to give him the drill and not letting him do it his way, basically ""not allowing him to do something in his own house"". We can both be stubborn and opinionated but 99.9% of the time it's not a problem...unless we trying building something together. IMPORTANT FACT: In the past we agreed (and have stuck with it) to allow someone to do it their way and only offer our opinion if they ask. In this case I feel like it's a different situation, as he was coming in to a new task (for him) which I had already had to troubleshoot, not me butting in to comment on how he was already doing something.

So, AITA in refusing his help unless he did it my way?  I'll accept the judgement as it comes and will apologize if I'm the AH, but I don't feel like I am.",No A-holes here
AITA for wanting to go to my cousin’s wedding instead of my wife’s grandma’s birthday party?,"So let’s rewind the tape to last week...

My wife gets a phone call from her aunt, who asks us to attend my wife’s grandma’s surprise birthday party in a couple of months.  Except they live over a 10 hour drive away, and the party is on a Friday night, so we would both need to take off work that day to make it.  My wife immediately wants to go and asks me if she thinks I could get off work.  I told her that I reckon I could, and so she tells her aunt to pencil us in.

Fast forward to today, and I open an invitation for my cousin’s wedding for the same weekend...  a wedding that my wife and I were both looking forward to attending (we have three young kids, weddings are great date nights!).  She mentions that it’s too bad we can’t go since we’re already going to her grandma’s.

At this point, I fully realize the logistical nightmare that this birthday party is going to be...  missing work, the cost of gas, having to have my two oldest miss school, never mind traveling 10+ hours in the car with 3 young kids... all for people that I’ve met twice in 8 years of being with my wife.  And then the regret hits me that I would be missing out on this beautiful evening in a picturesque venue with all of my family and quite a few of my friends.

But before I go too far down the rabbit hole of grandma-in-law dodging, I come up with a compromise - the party is Friday night, the wedding is Saturday night...  why not leave early Saturday so we can make it to the wedding?  I told my wife she could even stay home if she was too tired, and that either my mom or her mom would probably come help her with the kids so I could still go to the wedding with my dad (divorced parents).

Alas, no dice.  She said it would be too grueling on the children to do all that traveling so close together and that we need a recuperation day in her grandma’s town.  I agree with her, but I think it’s going to be grueling regardless.  That moves our 10 hour drive to Sunday, and then that puts us back to work and the kids back to school with hardly any time to rejuvenate(it’s almost imperative I have a day off between traveling and work to get resettled!).

So now we’ve flown pass the discussion phase and straight into the arguing phase.  She accuses me of prioritizing my family over hers - and I agree with her.  Then I try to remind her as softly as possible of all the times that she told me she didn’t care if we saw her family at the holidays and that she’d rather see my side of the family.  At this point, she caves, and says we should go to the wedding instead.  If you’re married though, you’ll know this wasn’t a real cave.  It was where I was supposed to relent and agree to go Grandma’s birthday...  except I didn’t.  And she went to bed angry.

AITA for complaining to my parents about being trapped at work due to weather when my situation might be better than theirs?,"I feel like an a**hole, but I wanted to post this anyway as I’m hoping other people can bring me to my senses.

I live in Texas and this week we got hit with major winter weather.  Texas rarely sees snow and when it does, it’s barely an inch.  Last night, however, was BAD.  Snow and ice blanketed EVERYTHING.  Weather stations are saying that the last time Texas saw this kind of weather was in 1989.

I work at a resort restaurant and my boss was insistent I came to work yesterday despite knowing the weather would get bad and I’d likely be trapped.  My dad dropped me off as he didn’t trust me to drive on the ice so I was stranded.  The resort offered a free room, but I’d have to work the next day in return, which was my day off.  I was frustrated but got over it, until today when I learned I’d have to stay AGAIN because the roads are too slick.  Meanwhile, my boss got his days off.

I’m just a bit frustrated and to let off steam, I’ve been ranting to my parents about everything.  They got angry and told me that “this is an emergency” and that at least my resort has power and heating while they’ve lost theirs a few times.  I was told to get over it and accept that yes, I’ll lose both my days off, but at least I’m safe.  A big part of me knows their right but I still find myself ranting about it anyway, even though I know nothing will come of it.  And what would I even do at home anyway?  Play video games?  I’d be more productive here, right?

I know I’m likely the bad one here and I’m ready to accept that.  I have the tendencies to focus more on negatives than positives and I thought maybe some outsiders could slap some sense into me and help me see something that I can’t.  I know I’m safe, but I’m just frustrated.

AITA for getting my brother and his friends in trouble with my parents?,"This happened a little while ago, but it did lead to a sort of split and a lot of coldness on the side of my brother and his girlfriend. So I wanted to get an opinion, looking back.

Around my 16th birthday, there was a little comic convention happening in my state. I was super, super excited to go to this. A friend and I made plans to go together on the second day, my birthday. My older brother (20) and his friends were going for all three days of the convention and were staying in a hotel nearby. My brother was also going to meet a girl (his now girlfriend) that he’d been long-distance with for a while at the convention.

I showed up on Saturday in my costume, and my friend bailed on me. I didn’t really have anyone else to hang out with at the convention. I went to go find my brother and his friends. I know my brother thinks I’m embarrassing, but let me join his group anyway because I was all alone. I knew they were annoyed I was there and I felt really bummed out. 

They all decide to leave the convention and go back to their hotel room. There are like 10 people in this hotel room. My brother and his now-girlfriend get on the bed and start cuddling and making out. Another girl and her boyfriend were making out on the other bed. The other 6 were just watching them, drinking. I was grossed out and I said something like, “this is really weird.” My brother’s friend said, “if you’re bothered, you can just leave.” So I did. I went to the lobby and called my Mom crying, saying I was upset and wanted to go home. She asked why, I told her.

I wasn’t here for this but my Mom called my brother and yelled at him for ruining my birthday, even if he had just met his then-girlfriend. She also said his friend who told me to leave was awful (she just hates him in general because he kicked a hole in our wall once). My brother called me and apologized, but sounded mad at me.

Now this whole thing colors my relationship with him and his girlfriend, who thinks I was a drama queen. Was I an asshole for getting upset, leaving, and telling my Mom what happened? He did do me a favor by letting me hang out with him and his friends.",No A-holes here
AITA for telling my wife she turned me off because she sharted?,"A bit of context here for you. A lot of times my wife and I say, “let’s have sex tonight” like we’re putting the occasion into our calendars. It just happens when you’re married. At least we still have sex. On this particular day, she had just seen Boyz 2 Men in concert, so she was probably pretty fucking psyched to get down. And when she is, I usually am. She’s objectively a total babe and I’m a lucky dude. But only 15-20 minutes before I go lay down in the bed, she’s telling me about how her stomach has been hurting her so much lately and she even sharted today. I went from ready to absolutely not ready. She came into the bed and she started kissing me, but I didn’t fully reciprocate and I told her it was because of the whole sharting thing. It reeeaaally bummed her out and made her feel self conscious, but I was trying to be honest about why I didn’t want to bang.

AITA for defeating a gang of small children at a carnival game?,"A few years ago I went to the local yearly carnival, and because I grew up pretty poor I had never really gone into sideshow alley to play carnival games. I know that these were pretty much a money trap for suckers, so I went around and looked for something exploitable.

I came across this game where you had to roll billiard balls up a board and into a set of holes in the shape of a triangle. The higher you get it, the more points you got. This fed into a sort of horse race thing, and the idea was to get your horse to the finish line by scoring points, racing against the other schleps. This seemed fairly simple, and also I was racing off 5 or 6 small children aged under 10.

I was in my mid-20s at the time, and in my head I was like ""I'm going to trounce these little kids."" So I paid my money and prepared to go to war.

Such would prove to be the case, and I won by a country mile. The carnie came over and asked what prize I wanted. I hadn't really considered actually winning anything, but having committed the act, I thought I better claim my prize. I pointed to a small (roughly 10inch tall) stuffed husky.

The carnie then got out a big hook and pulled down the biggest effing stuffed husky known to mankind (probably about 3 foot tall), and I was like ""What the eff am I going to do with this for the next 6 hours?"" as I walk around the carnival. I managed to cram it into my rucksack with its head poking out, and had to endure hours of people pointing and laughing at me/it.

I survived, however. I caught the train back to where I parked my bicycle at an old family friend's house. I then realised I couldn't both wear my bicycle helmet and have this stupid dog's head sticking out of my bag. In the end I decided it was sheer bad luck and asked the old lady if she would like a stuffed dog.

As it turns out her dog had just passed away, and she regaled me with a half hour description of their time together. But she took the cursed dog off my hands with thanks.

WIBTAH if I asked my best friend about his sexuality?,"So this is a rabbit hole, and I’d like to start with I don’t care if he sleeps with men or women. Or even if he likes to sleep with both. Absolutely his business. This is more of a “bro why didn’t you tell me thing?” And surprise because I always thought we were fairly close. 

So I was going through twitter and a tweet he liked popped up. I thought the video was funny so I went to his likes to see if there was more videos. As I was scrolling through his account I noticed a bit of a pattern emerging, so out of curiosity I went to see who he followed. 

He followed a lot of gay porn accounts (which again is fine) but he’s always claimed to be 100% straight. I want to know if asking him if he’s not is appropriate and how do I let him know I’m cool with whatever he wants to do? Or do I just let this discovery go and see if he ever tells me by himself? 

I’m also scared because what if that was meant to be liked on a separate account? I don’t want him to be blindsided if someone else finds out about it because he liked it on his account where people can find him. 

I’m feeling conflicted. If he’s in the closet I don’t want to force him out. I’m probably horrendously overthinking this.

AITA For Freaking Out When My Sister Brought Home Dying Lambs,"First time poster, so sorry for any mistakes. 

My (24f) older sister Josie (29), is a vet and is still working through the current sitution. Several lambs were found to be super sick this morning at a farm.  My sister spent all day treating them and wasn’t going to be able to go back to the farm for a couple of days.  Based on their status at the end of the day, she was concerned the lambs would die if left at the farm.  So she ended up bringing them home to treat in our house to give them the best chance to survive. There was no cell service near the farm, so she couldn’t call to ask if this was okay.  Unfortunately, one of the three lambs was severely sick, was deteriorating rapidly, and passed away. 

So, I was not told that Josie was bringing these lambs home. She just called me up and asked me to set up our puppy’s pen. I assumed she had found someone’s lost dog or something since she asked me to put our pups outside. When she came home, she brought in a tub of three lambs. I was pretty shocked, as she’s never done anything like this before. I started freaking out a bit since one already looked like it was dead and I do NOT deal well with death or dead things in general. I quickly excused myself and spent the next 2 hours or so crying and almost hyperventilating thinking about the lambs dying in our kitchen.

I finally came out of my room for dinner and Josie casually mentioned that one of the lambs had died and her colleague had come by and picked it up. I basically shut down into a panic, asked for the keys to the car we share, and went for a drive. I was gone for about 20-30 minutes, just letting myself cry it all out, since I felt so bad for not wanting these animals in our small house, but I didn’t want them to die just because I was uncomfortable. So here’s where I may be the a-hole. When I left, I forgot my phone at home and didn’t say where I was going or when I’d be back. Josie freaked out because she was obviously worried and had my whole family calling to try and find me. So now I feel doubly bad because my sister was just trying to help these lambs and I bolted on her and worried everyone. AITA for freaking out over having dying lambs in the house?

AITA for refusing to teach a kid who creeps me out?,"To provide some background, I am a petite female working as a language lector. I only teach people individually and try for my lessons to be fun. Each lesson is just me and the student (max 4) in my classroom for an  hour, which seems to work for everyone, and the results are  pretty good, but it is also the reason why I try to pick my clients  carefully - feeling a bit vulnerable all alone with them.

So  about half a year ago a lady contacted me about lessons for her two small kids (girls 7-9yo). At first everything was normal and fine, the kids were sweet and excited to learn. Until one of the girls started saying creepy stuff. She would draw a house and explain that ""there lives a cannibal who eats kids"" and go on in detail explaining how the man chopped somebody up and which part he is eating/cooking/grilling.

The first time, I was shocked and told her mum, but the mum just shook it off, but it keeps happening. As the lessons went, I found out that the kid's favorite movies  are gruesome horror movies, which she is capable to find online on her  own, and which she states ""are not scary to watch, they are so funny!""

Probably  the last drop was when we were playing with dolls, and this girl  arranged them all to lie on the floor of the dollhouse with one standing  in the middle and made me and her sister guess what has happened, we  tried ""she is reading a story to them"", ""they are playing a game"", etc.  nope! IN the end, she exclaimed excitedly ""NO! SHe has poisoned them All  because they were annoying!""

Since then  I have to explicitly ban murder/killing from every single game because her sister, who was originally visibly scared of it, started getting in on the ""fun"", and I am starting to feel that I have to cut my connection to this family ASAP.

I am already creeped out by that kid, and cannot imagine spending time with her alone when she grows bigger. I  have already heard about her ""digging a hole to bury a classmate in,  because they are naughty"", and her own mother commented ""I am just waiting for somebody to disappear"" in a half-joking half-serious manner.

So,  AITA? Is this a normal kid behavior which will pass? Am I  overreacting? Am I a scaredy-cat? Or do I rightfully feel in potential danger? I have no idea how to break it to their mom, who is a very sweet person...

Edit: I should probably add, that another thing which makes me back out is that I have seen the kid physically attack her mother a few times it pretty normal situations. The reaction was totally unexpected, 0 to 100 in a second. I don't want to get in such situation, because it could only end in trouble...

Edit 2: I feel I need to defend myself here - I have NEVER scolded, criticised or shunned the kid, or any other. I have never given her a reason to feel bad, and would never do that. I treat all children as individuals and with respect, it is the reason why we have such good relationships. When I ban murder from the games, the kid laughs, because she takes it as an inside joke, not being criticised.",No A-holes here
WIBTAS if I skipped my sister's wedding ceremony?,"Here are the reasons why I feel I might need to skip my sister's wedding ceremony.

I had surgery in February for gastric sleeve and now have new guidelines to keep my body healthy. One of them is to drink water regularly to avoid dehydration especially if I'm outside in the heat. This is the main reason why I might need to skip out on part of my sister's wedding.

The ceremony will be outside in mid-afternoon near the end of July. Humidity in her state is high and the summers are blistering. At first, I figured I'll just bring a water bottle with me and sip on that so no problem, however, I went on a walk yesterday high 80's outside with clear skies. I was ten minutes into my walk when I started seeing lights and feeling light-headed. I drank some water and it helped enough so I could get home but I nearly blacked out before I made it inside. This scared me. If drinking water out on a relatively hot day where there is little humidity could cause such a reaction I'm not sure if I could handle sitting under a hot, wetter heat for my sister's wedding.

I don't want to cause a scene at her ceremony if I faint or have to leave in the middle of it due to the heat. So if it's really as hot as it should be on her wedding day WIBTAS if I didn't attend the ceremony? I also want to clarify that I intend to let my sister know in advance and this is her second wedding, not her first.

\*\*I also want to make it clear that I go on walks often, usually early morning or late evening so I'm not out during the hottest periods of the day but on the day I nearly passed out I was out earlier in the afternoon which will be the around the time the wedding ceremony is scheduled.

\*\*Lastly there will be nothing shading the guests during the ceremony. It's out in the open on grassland with no trees nearby.

AITA I told Grandpa he was making grandma upset and how.,"Hello reddit, first time poster here. I need some advice on something. 
             ( Background) I moved to southern Georgia (USA) when I was about 8. Upon moving here I went to church every Sunday and quickly adopted a set of grand parents. Now Grandma had a rough country upbringing in south Georgia and Florida. She was a farm girl, rarely went to town and eventually got her education and became a teacher. Grandpa however was a northern boy who drove (first race cars, then trucks). Now they have been together for 33 years. Grandma is 86 and grandpa is just a bit younger. When grandpa was young (13-15) he hit a clothesline while riding his bike, this destroyed his thyroid, possibly causing development issues. Well now he has undiagnosed dementia and can't remember things, as well as being deaf (has hearing aids but still can't hear properly). So he has a sore on his foot that hasn't healed for over a year, he is trying to lose weight and keeps his diabetes in check but he still isn't the healthiest. He recently got the sore cleaned out but they put a wound vac on, and he spent that night and the next morning taking it apart to figure it out. Grandma has had a heart valve repair surgery, and is scheduled for a cornea transplant surgery, her body stopped producing insulin and she gained a little weight, so she has been self conscious and insecure for the last couple year's. Now Grandpa has gotten a lot worse and doesn't realize what he says is a bit offensive ( or very), and has started saying things like ""I'm determined to weigh less than her."" Or ""It was fine before she got her internet setup."" ( His computer quit working, it just wasn't plugged in).Well it came to a head today and grandma told grandpa to figure out what he needs to move on, so he ""doesn't have to bother"" with her. With all of the surgeries,  stress, and fear, I just want them to be okay. Now I have started working for them as a caregiver, but I'm not under any contract or non-disclosure agreement (verbal, moral, or written) I love them both but grandpa can't understand why she is so upset. I really don't think I should get involved but they are both scared. So here is where I might be an a**hole. I tried to explain to grandpa that grandma is scared and insecure and that maybe some of the things he has said in the past year may have triggered her. I'm worried I should have kept my mouth shut.

AITA For Wanting To go to my Dad’s instead of Stay at my Mom’s?,"  So at the current moment, I mainly stay at my fathers house. But I am at my mom’s right now due to my father working Tuesdays and Thursdays all day and night, and it’s break for school.

 I get incredibly bored at my mom’s. She does hiking and country stuff like camping, and going to swimming holes. That is not my thing, at all I hate doing it because i get bored of it so easily. That’s off topic however.

 I recently got a new computer for Christmas, and have been attached to it because I love to play games, That’s just what I do. 

Enough Background Info, on to the story.


 So i’m at my moms, and lo and behold i’m sitting in my phone being bored, because she doesn’t like to do anything i like, she’s sitting watching TV with my sister. I’ve already asked her what are we going to do and if we have plans for the week, as I’m staying there for the middle of the week due to my father working. My dad calls me to check up on me and I say my mind, I’m extremely bored and I wanna go home, to do what I enjoy. He says he can pick me up on. Wedsnday, I say great. So here’s where I might be AITA, idk at this point. I ask my Mom, I’m really bored and I don’t wanna hurt your feelings, but I would rather go to my dads, then stay here. She says no, and that I don’t spend enough time here when I’m here on the weekends (every other) and says I can’t spend any time with her. I get irritated and say well Im not going to spend time with you if your going to select things that are boring. She says: Well you don’t like to do anything except play on you’re fucking computer. 

That isn’t true, I suggest movies or bowling and stuff and she says no.

AITA for not going to Grandparents 50th anniversary,"A bit of context: My Dad passed when I was very young and I lost contact with his side of my family because they didn't like my mom. I have seen them sporadically throughout my childhood but haven't had contact with them for about 4 years now.

  
So my Grandparents (Mom's side) are having their 50th wedding anniversary in July and most of my family is going. They live on the east coast and I am on the west coast, so flights are not the cheapest. I was planning on going out for the event, but my cousin (dad's side) called me out of the blue and invited me to a family reunion over the fourth of July. Now I haven't seen them for so long so of course I want to go, But I can only afford to take one trip. I go home to see my Mom/Grandparents about three times a year and was just out there for mothers-day, so I chose to go to the family reunion. 

When I told my mom she was PISSED, like really mad. I understand that a 50th wedding anniversary is a big deal and I would love to go to it, but I just don't think I can pass up an opportunity to reconnect with the other side of my family.

WIBTA For wanting to move out of my apartment?,"English isn´t my first language and there isn´t really an English equivalent of what my current housing is called, so I´ll just stick with apartment.

First, a bit of backstory. I(19F) suffer from social anxiety as a result of bullying when I was younger. Because of this, I wanted to challenge myself when I start college by sharing an apartment with someone else. So, I moved into this shared apartment a week before college started and was met with possibly the dirtiest room I have ever seen. My room wasn´t too bad, but the shared kitchen/entry and bathroom was straight up filthy. It was incredibly dusty, there were stains everywhere, including the bathroom, and even the inside of the refrigerator was so dirty that the bottom drawer was actually stuck! My mother did a really incredible job cleaning up the place, she worked so hard to make clean the kitchen/entry and the bathroom, while I unpacked, assembled furniture from IKEA, tidied and cleaned my room. It took us three days to make this apartment habitable, and I am incredibly grateful for everything she did to make my first apartment as homely and clean as possible.

The problem I am now facing, and the reason I want to move out, is my roommate. I don´t have anything against my roommate, she´s nice enough, it´s just that we have been sharing this apartment for 2 weeks now and she has slept here, without her boyfriend, once. She and her boyfriend alternate between sleeping at his place or at her place, which is also my place. I don´t mind it when they´re at his place, I actually prefer it, the problem is when they´re here, and I can hear them... passionately hugging... in the middle of the day... or keeping me up at night. This paired with my anxiety is stressing me out and making me terrified of leaving my room when I know they´re here. It got to the point where I missed a day at school because I was too scared to walk past them. I have also missed several meals because I´m scared of bumping into them in the kitchen. I´m fine when it´s just her, but I can´t handle it when her boyfriend is here.

So, I want to move. Because of the way this student-apartment-complex-thingy works, I don´t have to put in a three months’ notice or anything. I just have to submit an application to change apartments. If my application is accepted, I will have both apartments at the same time for the remaining days of the month, and the move will be finalized at the end of the month. The apartment I want is literally in the same building, just the address next door. The problem is that if I move, I feel like I´m throwing all the hard work my mother did, back in her face. And considering how she´s like, that is most likely how she´ll feel too.

AITA Thanksgiving homework,Hello everyone. So here is the possible a hole ness. Today my school let us out for Thanksgiving break. I was given (in my opinion) a lot of homework. I texted everyone in the group chat that i have a week load of homework because i get the week off. My friend (x) said to cut the cr*p because my other friends brother (y)in the same classes and said that we did not get that much homework and that he will get it all done in less that 1.5 hours. My voice is skewed here but y is smarter than me and I said that because I am not the smartest person but am in 3 honors and 1 ap class that I worked to get where I am. Y is also not taking 2 odmf the classes that i am and those ones gave me the most homework (convenient right) Also keep in mind that x is not in honors and ap classes. I have a solid 95 ish in all my classes and and 89 in hon geo. Here is where I belive that I am the a hole because I almost said that x should not be talking because he does not know how hard j worked to get to where I am. Am I the a hole?

AITA for not ordering from somewhere that had vegetarian options?,"This happened a few months ago, but has been bothering me since, wondering if I was inadvertently the asshole. 

No throwaway because it's not necessary. 

I work in a 911 PSAP, we're a tight-knit group that works together every shift and we get along really well. That being said, there are a couple of girls I don't know really well (aka, their food preferences) and they are not overt about it. 

Over the last few times we've had food nights together, I've gathered that they are vegetarians. 

A couple of months ago, (not a scheduled food night) I was feeling like Popeye's Fried Chicken. My hubby was going to be passing by a Popeyes and my HQ and I had mentioned that I was craving Popeye's. 

My saint of a husband offered to pick it up for me and drop it off at work. I sent a message around the room informing everyone of my awesome husband and his offer and I made sure he picked up enough chicken for anyone interested... my treat. 

I received a message back from one of the girls who is vegetarian saying basically ""Thanks for the offer... but vegetarian.. You know..."". I don't think she was trying to be an a**hole at all. But that made me rethink my decision to offer chicken to the whole room.

Should I have kept my mouth shut unless there were vegetarian options on offer?

AITA?

AITA for bringing lunch to work that bothers my coworker?,"EDIT: He also puts his tuna sandwiches in the toaster oven, which smells up the office. But he isn't bothered by that and no one bats an eyelash.

Okay, so here's the deal. I recently cut out red meat from my diet for health reasons and have only been eating seafood. Many days, I would often bring vegetarian dishes to work but being that I also eat fish, maybe once or twice a month, I'd bring a piece of fish to have with a salad and bread. 

My coworker and boss bring and warm up foods that I don't eat or don't like the smell of (Indian food, food smelling strongly of garlic etc.) but I'm not childish and I know that I won't have to eat their food and the smell will eventually go away, plus we have air freshener. 

Today, I brought a piece of salmon and a salad for lunch and my coworker (who also brings tuna to work) freaked out about how bad he hates the smell of fish. He literally left the office for like an hour even though I ate everything within 10 minutes and aired out the office and sprayed air freshener. 

He then comes back and emphasizes again that he hates the smell of fish and how it made him feel like he was going to throw up and he got a migraine from it and had to take medicine. Then he had my boss use disinfectant spray to clean out the microwave. 

Let me reiterate, I VERY RARELY bring seafood to work. It's not at all an everyday thing, but I do need more substenance than a salad or grilled cheese some days.

AITA for wanting to know my bf's answers to a test?,"So, I was going down a rabbit hole of boredom this evening and found a variety of personality quizzes. I stumbled across a kink/bdsm test and told my bf about it. He wanted to try it out try as well. 

Here's my trigger: I feel like my bf and I have a mutual understanding in those regards and know what  the other likes etc.  

He obviously did it on my computer and I wanted to watch. But ..... He apparently didn't like me looking at his answers because he didn't wanted ""that look"" from me. (Referring to the ""are you for real"" look, I assume)  I kind of got a little hurt. I thought we were able to talk openly about those things, but he wouldn't let me see. 

The quiz ends up with telling you stuff like ""You're 90% most like likely to be a dom. Or you're 55% most likely to like pain."" etc.  He did show me those results, but I don't know why he wouldn't let me see the answers.

"AITA: I am staying with family can't STAND being near my schizophrenic cousin, she creeps me out.","I feel like a giant asshole for not being more compassionate to those with mental illnesses. Hear me out:

I'm in my 20's, and have been going through a rough time with my health (severe fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue/chronic pain and other issues), went through a massive breakup, estranged from my family (they don't believe that I have a chronic illness). My second cousins have been very generous to let me stay with them for a few weeks, to get back on my feet again. I am super grateful for that.

They are older (70's), their daughter is in her late 40's. She lives at home, now I know why: I discovered (I stay in the room next to her) after a week or so that she actually has a severe mental illness and talks to herself *constantly.* She spends the majority of her time locked in the bathroom, whispering and cackling to herself in multiple different creepy voices.

She regularly screams at her parents. I overheard them talking, she was angry about me being there. Her mom confessed the mental illness to me and said it flared up. I've been polite and staying out of her way as much as possible. She avoids me, glares at me, and seems to hate me.

I feel like an asshole...I've disrupted the family, am getting a huge favor, AND I am not compassionate. Her mother (who owns the home) welcomes me with open arms. I have almost no money, having spent it all on my medical bills and having supported my ex-boyfriend's career (mistake) before getting dumped. My health is horrible, I'm applying for disability soon, and I have a hard time walking due to the pain and issues I have.

I know the 'right' thing to do would be to leave, since my presence is clearly exacerbating the illness, therefore putting stress on the whole family. But I'm desperate. My parents won't help me until I can get approved for disability, I have no money.

Beggars can't be choosers, but my schizophrenic cousin is creeping me the *hell* out. I feel like I'm in a psychiatric hospital. There's the fear that being schizophrenic, she may hear some voice convincing her to do something to me. I'm on edge. I avoid her and lock my door.

She disturbs enough that living out of my car or finding an old friend/another family member is starting to sound appealing. But I'm just struggling to do much right now with energy and pain. I just need a place to plan my next move. I can stay here but I feel like a jerk for biting the hand that feeds me.

**So: (TL;DR:)** Am I the asshole for not being able to stand my cousin's mental illness / holding judgemental views, fearing schizophrenia? Being chronically ill myself, I feel I should be more compassionate. I feel like an a\*\*hole for disliking her so much. But it's the truth. I feel bad for her poor parents for having to deal with her terrifying unstable mental issues and secretly wish she were institutionalized for everyone's sake. I guess physical and mental illnesses just suck for everyone involved.

EDIT:

I forgot to add, she has her own multi-bedroom house that her parents bought her a few minutes away, she is there sometimes but I guess she chooses to live with her parents, perhaps because she needs to. I am not sure exactly what the situation is, just that she is there part of the time and here part of the time.",No A-holes here
AITA Found Long Lost Brother,"Found Long Lost Biological Brother

Here goes nothing.. I dont know where to start so I'll start abt my parents. they got together after school had finished and had me and my baby brother when they were 18 and 20. My brother and I are 2 years apart. 4 years later, filed a divorce because my bio-dad is an abusive a-hole. took my brother along with him but i have been living with my mom's side ever since i was a baby so that didn't make much of a difference. (Dad lives in another state) I grew up with my grandma up until now, shes also registered as my Foster parent. Not living in the same roof with my mom. My mom married my stepdad back in 2009 and i have 4 stepsiblings. Theyre ok. Often visit me during school holidays.

its been 18 years since the separation. Im 22 now and hes 20. I do think of him every now and then but its just multiple occasion of something important in life like, ""Hope he passed the school yearly test"" etc.. My mom mentioned his name to me a few times like ""Oh he must be 19 this year.."" ""I wonder how he is right now"" and ngl she has been searching for his name on Facebook every now and then. and she told me few years back that a child will always runs back to their mom. 

Long story short a few days ago she found him on Facebook. It was obvious because his background picture was my mom when she was young. And she took the initiative to approach him. I dont know how their conversation went but it was enough to know that hes living alone now and has no stable job. My mom asked me if it was okay that shes approaching him, i'd say go for it. thats what she always wanted anyway. 

So last night she asked me if its okay for me to contact him? ""hes really happy he found us"" ""he keep on asking about you. he remembers you"" ""if you dont know what to talk about ask about what hes up to. tell him to go find a stable job""

Am I the asshole for not getting giddy? I dont even know the guy and i feel like im intruding his life to go and say ""u should look for a stable job"" In all honesty i feel like this is all too sudden, and i have a busy life to keep with. With the pandemic, online classes, my degree, finance and stuff. Throughout my whole life I was ok for not knowing him, I knew he exists somewhere but I dont have the urgency to look for him. And because of my living situation i'm not even a family person. Thanks to my mom I have his contact with me but I really have no ideaa what to say to him. Nor do I want to to keep in contact with him. But i will feel bad if i dont. But i dont want to.

WIBTA For refusing to censor my language,"Hi r/AmITheAsshole. Longtime listener,  first time caller here. 

Long story short. My girlfriend and i currently rent a 3 bedroom house in a pretty expensive city in my state. Both of us make okay money but we would not be able to afford our house without roommates. Well one of our roommates left suddenly to take care of her dad who is in bad health. No big deal, we found another roommate who was willing to pay 100 more a month than the previous roommate, lowering mine, my girlfriend's and our second roommates rent. However our new roommate has kids. Now i work a lot, I'm in sales so i normally work a 40 hour a week job plus quite a bit of overtime so i wasn't really too involved in the search for a roommate. My girlfriend gets off arround 2-3pm and i get off arround 7 most days. Needless to say,  i really didn't get a say in who moved in. Not a huge fan of kids but my girlfriend let our new roommate move in due to some personal issues she was having that required her to move immediately and since they know each other from highschool, she let her move in without consulting me much on it but i did ultimately give her the go ahead to do so. I don't have a problem with helping someone in need who would otherwise be homeless. Been in that position before and it sucks. 

Earlier today,  I was cleaning the trash out and got excited because i found an extra box and was like "" fuck yeah! This box is gonna make things so much more convenient!"" ( I get excited easily, part of my ADHD I guess ) anyways, i said this in front of her kids ( i think ones 11 months and the others about 3 years old?) The mother didn't seem to care but my girlfriend whispered to me that need to watch my mouth now that there is a kid in the house. Now i normally swear like a sailor in casual conversation. My dad was a biker and a factory worker so i was very much raised with ""Fuck, shit and ass"" in my vocabulary and i see no problem with using those words in normal conversation. (Obviously not at work or around certain people)
So i dont see my language as a big deal, and it definitely seems like the mother doesn't care and until she comes forward and says something, I really don't care either.

AITA for telling my flatmate he can't have his girlfriend over too often?,"  I (26f) recently got a new flatmate (25m), renting one of the rooms in an apartment in my name. The two other people living here are away for weeks at the time, so it's mostly me and him (especially in the past 5 weeks). He's friendly and social and everything has been great for the first 3 months, we hung out and I felt comfortable hanging around the flat looking like sh\*t, which is very important to me, as I am one of those people who recharge batteries away from social situations.

He recently got a girlfriend, who seems nice and rents a room in an flat nearby. Even though we had all agreed to try and give one other fair warning when bringing someone home, he lets me know she's coming over approximately 30 seconds before she arrives. As I feel uncomfortable being the extra-person in the room during date nights and snuggle time, I tend to either go out or lock myself in my room when he brings her home (she always comes over mid-week and after 9pm and I don’t love going out in the snow just to give them space). Kitchen and living room are the same room, so I only use the bathroom and smoke out of my bedroom window.

Last week I was on my way home from work, looking forward to taking off my bra and relaxing on the couch in front of the TV. As I walked in he told me she was on her way over and they were going to cook and have a romantic dinner. She had already been over 3 three times during the same week, talking loudly right outside my door late at night knowing I had an early shift. So I snapped and told him ""It's okay for tonight, but this cannot be an everyday thing, next time please go to her place"". I apologized for the tone a couple minutes later, but I stood by my statement. He wants me to be comfortable having her around the apartment, and it's nice of him, but he also said he'd like her to stay over every night and his bed is more comfortable than hers so he'd rather have her sleep here.

I don't want to be the a\*\*hole who tells him she cannot come over, and I am aware that there is no real issue with me looking like shit or sitting in the common areas while she's there, but I simply don't feel comfortable. I didn't rent the room to a couple because I've lived with couples before and it was a nightmare (it's not nice having to third wheel every time you want to watch a movie on the couch in your own home). Obviously, he should be able to have his girlfriend over, but it's starting to be too often and he's taking over the entire apartment, since at this point, I'm either out or in my room. This is the first time he lives in a shared flat, he's always had his own place and that results in him not really thinking about anyone else other than himself when it comes to shared spaces. Talking to him hasn’t given any results.

We both interned there and mine led to a job offer but despite them liking him, his company couldn’t hire him at the time. He searched for another job there for a the few months before he graduated but I never felt like he tried as hard as he could have. He did not find a job there and instead took a job approximately 1800 miles away with the agreement that it was what it was and I would just find a job there since I graduated second. I interviewed a few places and found a job there after much searching. I gave up the job close to my hometown which was also a job that I really loved and was passionate about and moved with him. 

Fast forward eight months, I hate my job and miss my family and he loves his job and doesn’t want to leave. The company he interned with near my hometown now wants him back, with a 35% raise but he doesn’t want to leave his job despite it paying less and he liked the other job equally as much. I think he is just comfortable and likes his team a lot, and the weather and surrounding area here. I feel for him but I also can’t help but want to leave and go back to my job that I loved and was passionate about and the city that I loved and grew up near. We are software engineers and it is hard to get a job like that without connections. All my connections are in the other city and my family is as well. His family is in a different city but he hardly visits them even though he could, he has stockpiled vacation days but won’t go anywhere without me. I have gone to visit my family and they’ve visited me a couple times and I really miss them so it seems like that’s a higher priority for me than for him. 

From my perspective, it seems like he won’t give up a great job for another great job that pays more, leaving me with a job I hate instead of a job I love. On top of, he would rather stay in a place he likes the weather and surrounding area where neither of our families are, rather than an equally nice place but he likes slightly less where my family is. It hurts even more because I gave up a job I loved originally for a job I knew I wouldn’t like so that I could live with him, on the assumption that he couldn’t get a job in the other city and now I feel he won’t do the same. So AITA for wanting him to take the job?",No A-holes here
AITA for just wanting to be friends?,"Last Friday I made plans with a girl that I met on Bumble to meet up and go kayaking as a first time hangout. There wasn't much prior discussion as to what either person was interested in or looking for out of the meetup. It's worth noting that both her profile and mine indicated the ""Don't know yet"" category as to why we were on the app. 

So we get around to hanging out and get on the water. Everything is good, things are very flirty but also fun. It certainly all felt normal, natural and cool. We made references to a show we both knew quite a bit of and initially bonded over when chatting through the app. 

Eventually, it starts to get dark and we decide to head back to land. As we're headed back over, the topic of ""well what are you looking for?"" finally rears its gnarly head out. She talks about how she had just gotten back on ""dating apps"" and realistically wasn't all that sure. I explain how I'm still relatively new to the area (like a year) and don't see my current situation as anything permanent. This goes over fine and just about offers to introduce me to her friends in the area. 

As we get back on land and begin to load up the kayaks on her car, the conversation comes back to being friends. She nearly blurts out ""what about friends with benefits?"" to which I indicate that I'm not opposed but wouldn't want it to conflict with anything further. Things get the awkward, first time meeting question of whether or not to kiss the other person. We share a clumsy kiss leading to a second.

After that, we head our separate ways and I get back. The discussion shifts into a bit more of a hookup or certainly a fwb status. We exchange a nude each to which the response turns into how we should have gone home with one another that evening. Come the next morning, I play it cool but talk about trying to make plans to hangout again. She gets back to me a bit later in the day and proceeds to say ""I don't want to be friends, and I don't want to hook up, I think I want a relationship"". 

Naturally, my instincts go to think that I've messed something up and so I ask if there's anything I've done wrong or the like. She tells me no and proceeds to say that everything that transpired was a way of her past that she was over and trying to move past. OK, I get that. I tell her that its cool but I don't understand why friends move off the table, after she explicitly said that ""it's always good to add more friends"". 

Now, I should mention that meeting up with this girl was like striking gold. She was cool, genuine (or so I thought) and we had a lot of good stuff in common. So, while I wasn't fully open to the idea initially of dating, I extend the olive branch because I was genuinely wowed by her (for this, I'm sure I'm the A-hole). I get a ""lemme think about it"" which ultimately led to ""I don't want to pursue anything"". 

So now I'm sitting here, after a whirlwind weekend of all of this, asking myself AITA for just trying to be friends and things moving in a weird way?",No A-holes here
AITA for not wanting to go to my Uncles Funeral?,"So Redit I've been asking myself over the weekend if IATA for not wanting to go to my Uncles funeral?

First I have not seen him for over 7 years (last time i saw him was my step dad's funeral. I also did not even talk to him then)

The reason for not wanting to go is one I was not that close to him at all. Also that when my grandmother (his mother) was near the end of her life He took her down to get his name on her house (To be able to pay bills as he said to her) and told her what she was signing was to get his name on the house with hers. But was infact it was taking her name off and just adding his own. So when she passed away two months later. The will was read when it came to the house that was supposed to be split with all 4 kids. It was no longer in her name so there was no inheritance. Also when her (grandmothers) belongings were being split up no one was allowed to take anything as it was all ""in his house"" I was very close to my grandmother and was infact on the phone with her when she had her last and fatal heart attack. So here i am wondering that should I be there for my mom even tho I actually yipped for joy when I got the text that he had passed? I could fake it for my mom if she decided to want me there but so far I am leaning to not going at all I wouldn't want to upset other family members with my fake sympathy

I think that i will the the A**hole if i go and offer fake sympathy. So as the old adage says if I cant say anything nice I wont say anything at all",No A-holes here
AITA for being active at night,"So me and my girlfriend live in a basement apartment in a 2 story house in a nice neighborhood. We pay 1200 a month for a 2 bedroom half bath. 1200 is definitely a lot for where we live. That amount could get you a 3 bedroom luxury apartment but we wanted something nice and we don’t have the best credit since were young and this place didn’t require an application or credit check or anything. Just hella expensive for a maybe 35 by 20 foot basement apartment. 

On the top floor the landlords are a mid 30s couple with two toddlers and a baby. More the religious conservative type and we are more of the social stay up late drinking college age type. With that being said we’ve been very aware and respectful of the fact that we are still living with a family. Basically the problem here is that the insulation for the basement is extremely thin and you can hear any amount of noise unless we literally whisper. We work night shift so when we get home and are just drinking having a normal inside voice conversation they can hear it.... and they’ve asked us multiple times to be quieter but we can’t be more quiet unless we literally stay whispering. They always say they have kids and don’t get much sleep and everything which I understand but we work hard and pay this much in rent and everything I think we should be able to have a normal conversation at night.

With that being said they have not been perfect either. Their bedroom and the baby’s bedroom is right above our apartment. The baby wakes up at 3 in the morning like clockwork and has woken up us multiple times but we never complained just bc it never bothered me and I didn’t want to complain bc I’m nice and understanding. And running around and jumping and stomping right above us at 8-11 in the morning most mornings which has also woken us up. We have literally one month left but they’re trying to evict us a half month before the lease ends. I know this sounds more like legal advice but I’m jw even tho we signed a lease knowing we would be staying with a family. We are their first renters so theyve never had ppl stay in their basement before and didn’t know what to really expect themselves. who is the a hole guys.",No A-holes here
AITA for wanting to cook and eat? I hate my dad for this,"AITA here in this situation? I recently bought ingredients to cook my own food with my own money. So my dad often would use the kitchen to lounge and cook but it's usually once or twice a week. So after cooking my meal, my dad came home from eating out since he's lazy. I just came back from the gym and cooked my food for almost an hour. Him seeing the kitchen not up to his standard starts mouthing off about how dirty it is, how disgusting the area looks like and so on with sarcasm thrown in.

I was so hungry after cooking that I wanted to eat first before cleaning up and still prior to that, I actually washed up the pots before indulging in my food.

My dad had too much to say and I just couldn't take it, my plate was still 3/4 full and I just had to throw it down the trash. I am so pissed off right now. What's his fucking problem? Is it wrong for me to cook? For me to eat? For me to wash it later after my fucking meal? What the fuck is wrong with him? I'm 24 so I'm an adult not a kid.

Am I the ass hole? He said I'm a cry baby for taking it to heart. How are you going to finish your food when you hear a piece of shit mouthing off at what you cooked and how oily the table is.

Edit: there is something that I have to add. My dad is jobless. Good for nothing men living in a house with expenses paid by my mum and me so him telling me to off what to and not to do when he contributes nothing is what made me even more pissed off",No A-holes here
AITA for not helping him move out?,"So, I'm a 18F and I live with my 19M ex boyfriend. We moved here on May 1st and we agreed that he would only stay here until he found an apartment. He's moving on June 1st.

He didn't really help me move, except for driving things from my old apartment to the new one.

He asked me if I could help him move, and I say that I would check, since I have a pretty bad ankle that we're trying to heal and I'm working a lot ( I'm a medical worker). I work night shift, so I mostly sleep at daytime

He told me that his dad and few of his friends would help him move.

AITA for joking around with my friend,"I just wanted to point out that we are 13 so this might be stupid

Me and my friend had an argument about me being mean. However I think I’m not sure if I’m actually the bad one but that’s why I’m here.

I did want to say I was a bit mean to him but I don’t think I’m in the wrong here

1. I treat people based on how they treat me. I have a lot of friends that I’m nice to. He’s probably the only friend I’m a bit mean to. I also give people way too much 2nd chances. There was a person in my class who was basically being mean to me the entire year yet I gave him second chances that he had some reason. It wasn’t until recently I decided he was a horrible human being and I shouldn’t feel sorry for him.

2. He is just mean to people. I treat people about how they treat me. And he is quite a mean person. He has made fun of me for being an atheist and my other friend for not having a dad. He has also seen me mad at him for stuff many times and he just made fun of me. I have also had other people say that they hate him so.

3. He does a lot of annoying things. There was a phase where he wouldn’t stop saying “that’s gay” and “ur mom”. And I’m not offended by ur mom jokes but it is still annoying. Also one thing that I have done to annoy him was lightly touch his bag with my foot, when I don’t see that as much of a problem and he has done worse.

4. I don’t like making fun of people unless it’s him. This might sound weird but listen. When I make fun of someone I feel horrible and even if they don’t care. The only other time I’ve hurt someone I literally cried for a day and it wasn’t visible it was a problem. ( I made fun of someone for being mad at getting 34/35 on a test. Turns out there was other things in there life that made them sad). 

5. I don’t think what I did was bad. It’s not one main thing but a lot of little things. I said that he was claustrophobic because he is an arse hole. He said to move more quickly in a hall way and I stopped as a joke and then started moving a bit later. And just small things like that. This is also something he would do and I never made fun of anything serious. But the thing that tipped him over the edge was: U suc.  (We were talking abut a game) and he said why is he unknown man and my friend said (cuz u suc).

(However I did say that he was unusually mad that I was lightly touching his bag with my foot, and that he has done worse.) The thing is though is that I generally believe this. He was unusually mad that I was touching his bag. When I brought this up he said “Well I didn’t do anything” but I don’t think I did anything either.",No A-holes here
WIBTA if I cut ties with a friend who has been very loyal to me?,"Lil bit of backstory: This friend of mine has been by my side for years on end. She took care of me when I was sick, was there with me when I was going through tough times and supported me whichever way she could.

However, I’ve been noticing some “red flags lately. Idrk if they can be considered red flags or something but they’re just things that seem kinda off.

1. She’s started making excuses and she’s trying to stay away from me. Now I know that she might want some personal space but I would invite her to play a game, she would say no, and she would be on 2 hours later playing with some other friends. This is starting to happen more often too.

2. She’s kinda been ignoring me in class and irl generally, she tends to hang out with the other people in my friend group and i’m 78% sure she says bad things about me. Idk how to feel about this either because she’s still here for me and basically is the same when around me.

3. She’s being quite an a/hole recently. She’s started dating someone and I fully support that but she’s starting to become a bit more mean. Our friendly banters started to hurt and she started “joking” around more. Honestly idk if she’s intending to hurt me or not.

There are other reasons but these are the main ones. I don’t really want to continue this friendship anymore and idk if everyone will hate me because I do have a bit of a bad rep.",No A-holes here
WIBTA for cremating my dad?,"My father passed away very recently. I won't go into too much detail but he and I had a rocky relationship when I was a child. He was prone to fits of anger due to alcoholism and was just a generally scary guy. We kinda reconciled as I grew into adulthood but by no means were we close when he died, I preferred for our relationship to be amicable yet distant. My parents divorced several years ago, dad never remarried, and I'm his only child, so the decision about what to do with his body rests with me. 

Dad was sick for a while before he died and I repeatedly asked him what he wanted done after he passed away. He was in an accident as a teen where he was burned pretty badly, so he said he definitely wasn't comfortable with cremation and being burned again. However, he said he wasn't comfortable with being buried either and didn't like the idea of rotting away in a hole. Rejected a mausoleum for pretty much the same reason. I told him those were his only options and he needed to pick one. He always said ""I'll think about it,"" evading the subject forever and never gave me an answer. Now I have to decide what to do for his burial and none of the options available to me are things he would want.

I've met with a funeral director and discussed the options, and a cremation is by far the cheapest way to go and that's what I'm thinking of doing at this stage. Dad had no insurance and was on the verge of filing for bankruptcy before his death, so I won't get anything in the way of inheritance. I'm going to be floating the bill here 100%. Due to his accident he very vehemently said he didn't want to be burned again, and I know I should be respectful of his wishes, but he never bothered to actually tell me what he wanted, just what he didn't want. And as far as being burned again, well, he's dead, he's gone, it won't hurt him since he can't feel anything. I've been mulling this over for several days and I just want to get his burial over and done with so I can move on with my life. I'm just struggling with how to respect his wishes when he never gave me any alternatives.

Aitah my mom fainted and hit her head and went to the hospital and when I told my freind she did nothing to comfort me.,"Hi this is my first time posting here and I'm on mobile so excuse any typos. So the other night I was with my mom watching pirates of the caribbean on a rainy night. When it rains hard it floods our backyard so after watching the movie we got up to look at how flooded the yard was. My mom then fainted and fell on the ground and we weren't sure if she hit her head (it was just me and her in the house). So I called the ambulance and she was took to the hospital. I was pretty shook up at this point and I wanted to talk to somone so I texted my freind and told her what happened. All she said back to my text was ""shit"" and didn't respond for 15 min. At that point I had gotten pretty worked up because our freind ship is bassicaly just me helping her threw her problems while she does nothing at all to help me. So I ended up going off on her and told her it was fucked up that I told her my mom fainted and hit her head and she  asked absolutely no questions. And her only excuse was she was with her bf. I think I'm overreacting and I shouldn't depend on other people to support me at all but am I the ass hole. And yea my mom's fine.",No A-holes here
WIBTA for not going to a friends birthday?,"Ok so I'm in middle school and have 2 sets of friend groups one I'm starting to slowly drift away from but I am still close with 3 of them. Anyway I'm big on indoor skydiving as in I have more then 5 hours clocked in the chamber that's just minimum most likely more. 

So the place I indoor skydive has 3 options.

 1 buy it when you get there (least amount of time able to buy) 


2buy a ticket then go whenever you want (still provides a good amount of time) 

And 3 schedule a class which gives the best amount of time.

So I usually do schedule cause it's best amount of time for money. And my friend knows how big I am on indoor skydiving. So I got it scheduled in around December cause they had good deals then. And got a bunch of flights scheduled in advance. One just so happened to be 2 months away on my friends birthday.

Now you would think hey just reschedule it right? Here's the thing that sucks if you book in advance and it's a private session you cant reschedule which is one the thing you sign when booking in advance. The only way you can reschedule is unless you do it within a month of the reservation. And I wasn't told the final details until about 2 weeks before the party.

So I told him and he got pissed (which is very unlike him) and we got in an argument. After 5min unsaid i dont really feel like talking about this and he agreed. The next day we talked and he said he was sorry and was already in a bad mood. But he added I was an ass hole for choosing not to go and to go to a hobby instead. I explained to him what I explained above and also said I still got him a gift (I was going to). So now I have to choose between a +300 dollar lesson or his birthday.

AITA- lying to my study abroad professor,"I woke up late for my 8:30 class and there was no way I’d make it in time. My professor has to teach the same class back-to-back, therefore I got myself up to ask him if I could just sit in his other class to avoid getting marked absent. By the time I got to school, there had been a fire drill going on and I ran into a friend from the earlier class. She told me she was on her way to speak to our professor because she got to class late, the fire drill ended the class early, and she wanted to make sure she was marked down on the attendance sheet. Immediately I saw the opportunity in front of me. 

*My professor is not the best teacher in the world. No disrespect for teachers, but he does not do a good job at educating his students. He has us do mini projects for homework so we can spend the entire class sharing our work, rather than him teaching. We never learn actual content. This is a common teaching method at my school in France. Yes, their academic culture is different from the U.S., but I don’t learn anything substantial here and honestly it stresses me out! 

Okay- back to the story. I walked with my friend to the classroom, and I stood beside her as she spoke to our professor. I was prepared to ask if I could sit in his next class but when my friend left, I was compelled to say the same thing she did, “Hi, I was late to class and want to make sure you marked me present. The fire drill interrupted class so I wanted to come back and double check.” It was too easy. He said “Are you sure you were in class?”, and I said “Yes the metro shut down making me a little late”. (This actually happened, seems to happen a lot in France). He interrupted and said, “Oh that’s right okay what’s your name?”. I told him my name and he said “voila you were here!”. After I left, I felt so guilty. Although I would have learned absolutely nothing if I stayed, maybe I’d feel more fulfilled just by being there? Idk, I feel like an asshole lying to my professor. I feel like an ass hole going all the way to school and then just turning around as soon as I saw a way out.

AITA for not wanting my friend to talk to my ex?,"look. i haven't said a word about how i truly feel about one of my closest friends still talking to my manipulative ex. i've just said that it sucks. 


i feel terrible for even thinking this because who am i to tell my friend whether or not he should be friends with someone? also, side note, they're like ""best friends"" and they've known each other since elementary. 


so i decided to tell my friend about the stuff my ex did to me, like constantly lie to me, manipulate me DURING our relationship and AFTER my ex dumped me by saying that he doesn't have that much time to live because he just got diagnosed with something but only /I/ know, and nobody else can find out, not even my friend, even though they have claimed that they're each other's 'best friend'. 


i told my friend this, he's one of my closest friends and unfortunately he's ""best friends"" with my ex. my friend told me that he's not going to stop being friends with my ex because nobody else wants to hang out with him BUT my ex, and that my ex is the only one that's keeping him ""company"" since he got back from college. he said that if i want to hate him for that, that he doesn't blame me, but he's still not gonna stop being ""besties"". 


i told him it's fine. but now, i can't help but feel terrible about it. in our same friend group, one of our friends did some messed up stuff to him and lead him on and stuff and i always backed him up and i always defended him and she WAS one of my best friends. now we occasionally talk here and there. but it sucks because i feel like i'm not getting the same back?


ALSO. i hate that i think all of that. because i REALLY don't think i have a say in anything my friend does. which is WHY i haven't told him anything and probably won't plan to because i already feel so terrible because i feel like i should stop whining about what happened to me. like people have / had it worse than i do, so why should i complain, or be hurt about something like this.

Tomorrow I graduate from high school. I dropped out due to severe mental health issues a few years ago. This is a big thing for me. 
My brother is my best friend and I really wanted him to be there. 
I called him today to ask where to drop off his ticket and he informs me that he's at the hospital so of course I ask him why and he says his son may be here within the next couple days. I'm happy my nephew is on his way and I'll get to meet him but, I was extremely upset.
He didn't warn me until literally two hours ago.. I was so excited to show him how hard I worked. t
He didn't even have the courtesy to warn me at least 24 hours in advance. I told him how upset I was that he didn't use his words and say ""hey, I don't think I'll be able to make it."" Was I supposed to stand up and look out at the audience and be shocked to see he wasn't there?
He didn't understand where my hurt came from. I'm so excited to have another nephew! It isn't about where he is.. To me it was the lack of communication. This blindsided the fuck out of me.

AITA for accidentally locking my sister in a bathroom?,"Ok hear me out,

Im 15 now, and the day still keeps me up at night and occasionally gives me claustrophobia to this day, 10 years ago in my old apartment when i was 5, my sister was about 2 or 3, she needed to go but she wasn’t tall enough to reach the door handle, so i had to open it for her. I closed the door for privacy when she went in, instantly forgetting that she was way too short to reach the door handle (my brain was the size of a walnut), and i went to go read a book on the one-person couch. I was estranged by the fact that she was taking particularly long in the bathroom, i heard the flushing and everything, as it our toilet was VERY loud. I continued on my book, but then got increasingly confused, as she never came out, i’d assume at the time that she was going No. 2, but even then i estimated that 10 minutes had gone by (when i got older and reflected on the incident i estimated the time, because the concept of time was so foreign to me it was like another language). Then, when i thought she couldn’t take any longer, i heard crying, i headed towards the bathroom because i suddenly remembered again that she was short, but then i stopped mid-run because i knew that it would be inappropriate for me to open the door for her. I got mom, and she turned the handle, when it didn’t budge, she yelled to me from the living room and asked why it wouldn’t work, i didn’t know, but to this day, i suspect i might’ve used the washroom a while before she did, and since i always locked my bathroom door, i might’ve coincidentally not pushed the door all the way in, so that lipstick top-looking mechanism that seals the door, but doesn’t lock it, couldn’t have been pushed all the way in, as in i might’ve closed the door, but with the slightest of cracks, making me think i closed and locked the door, but that would just be absurd, so i dismissed that theory. 


Back to what happened, my mom scrambled for tools to open the door, and me already knowing that i’ve already caused enough problems, handed her items from the toolbox to try and do something. My mom was gonna call the police, and i was scared as hell, thinking they were gonna arrest me, so i hid behind that one-man couch. I did everything i can to try to hide myself. The police came, noticed me, didn’t pay me any attention after that and proceeded to head towards the door, i’m not 100% sure what happened, but i think one of them was a lockpicker and used a sort of metal wire/paperclip that was unraveled to unlock the door (it was one of those handles that had a tiny hole in the middle for a key unlock thing). Estimated 3 minutes flew by, and something clicked, and i heard the hinges of the door swing open, i stayed in my hiding spot until they left, then emerged and apologized relentlessly to my little sister. 

I still have a guilty conscience about it though, so i thought I’d come here for judgement",No A-holes here
WIBTA - If I don’t invite all my cousins kids to our wedding,"First post/throwaway and on mobile, here it goes - for my sides guests the only children invited would be my nephews and two children that will be flying in with their parents and grandparents(my aunt and uncle) from another country. They are all roughly the same age (8-12years). I have big families on both my maternal and paternal sides. My mother is worried that my aunts and uncles on both sides of my family will be offended that their grandchildren aren’t invited. Couple reasons I don’t want to invite all the kids - the kids on my paternal side can be very bratty. Straight up I am not a fan of them. The kids on my maternal side are much better behaved even though they are quite a bit younger and there are a lot more of them. 
If we were getting married at the usual hall that everybody gets married at and is quite inexpensive I think I would put up with the bratty kids and invite them all. However, we’re getting married where the groom is from and it is five times more expensive and much more ‘posh’. I know that you’re not supposed to look at how much money you might make in gifts, but you hope to recoup some of the costs for at least the meal in wedding gifts. I know that we’ll end up in the hole paying for the families with kids. That might make me the asshole just for thinking that. I’m trying to save costs by cutting cousins kids from my list . . . Here’s the kicker my fiancé included kids on his list - there are about 5-6. He is convinced that his guests will cover the costs of their kids IF they decide to bring them.  I know that some of my cousins already intend on bringing their kids as they’ve already made comments about getting their kids new outfits even though invites haven’t gone out (it was not the time or place to say no kids when this comment was made). I’ve dropped hints to my maternal cousins that I wasn’t including cousins children and they seem fine with it and understanding even when it was explained that the out of country kids would be there. Again my mom still thinks that it will ruffle feathers if there are kids on fiancés side but not mine. My fiancé who is not as frugal as I can be thinks I should just invite them all. So if you made it this far and can get through the family tree . . . Would I be the asshole for standing my ground? (Invites haven’t gone out yet - but will be soon)",No A-holes here

When I applied to live here I wasn’t told that there would be frequent construction going on in the complex as well as our apartment. The apartment is in really good shape and i don’t really have any issues with it. Currently the only thing needing to be fixed is a huge square hole they cut in our ceiling. It’s been there since the beginning of February and they have yet to do anything with it.
      As soon as the semester started we began receiving papers saying that our apartment could be entered between 9 am and 5 pm for a full month. I was frustrated with the first one but figured I couldn’t do much about it. At the end of that month we received another of these letters. I feel like giving staff the ability to enter an apartment at anytime is intrusive. I’m constantly on edge about being able to shower during the day because what if I step into my room to find a staff member? I can’t even take a short nap between school work because half the time I’m woken up by someone needing to work on the apartment. 
       I feel like I live in a constant state of being prepared for someone to enter my room. I can’t relax until after 5 pm. My roommates and I keep a tidy apartment so we don’t have an issue with receiving a citation for cleanliness. I have an anxiety disorder and i feel like this constant stress is making it harder on me to be a functioning person. I feel like I don’t have my own space because of this. I also feel like a have almost no privacy.
       I just need to know if I’m being an asshole about this.  I would like to complain to my university housing department but maybe I’m just being way too sensitive. I understand that sometimes things need to be fixed but currently our apartment is fine and livable. Summer is approaching and we are being kicked out for further improvements to the apartment. I don’t understand why these issues they see can’t wait until then. 




Update: After reviewing the housing policy it seems they are able to enter whenever they see fit for maintenance. Thank you to everyone for the advice. I will be discussing it with housing and possibly taking it further if needed. ",No A-holes here
WIBTA if I rehome my cat due to property damage?,"My current living situation (Moved here at the beginning of the year), is quite basic. a full-time student living by college, renting a tiny apartment with shitty carpeting. I have 2 cats, one which is an ESA (This post isn't about him, he is perfect.)

As it stands as of the time of making this post, I currently have 24 ""childproofed"" spots in my place. In my apartment, there is mostly hardwood floor with sections of carpeting; closet and bedroom. every single area where the carpet meets floor has to be covered by something; this being due to an incident where I came home one day and saw her chew up lose fibers of the carpet, and eventually dislodging some part of it. I can now easily pull up the carpet and see what's underneath. I know for sure due to just that I am DEFINITELY not getting my security deposit back. That issue only accounts for 4/24 ""censored"" areas.

When I leave for the day, I need to lock them up in the bedroom, out of straight fear that my cat will destroy something that I ""forgot"" to put away or hide or ""censor"". I wake up in the middle of the night dozens of times from random noises that I'm afraid is her destroying something. I can't have plants anymore; where gardening used to be a very personal therapeutic thing for me. This actually makes me feel terribly shitty, as my childhood dogs were always kept in crates by my family.

Another stress is the fact that I have an insane amount of tech that has wires, and that is her favorite thing to absolutely destroy. The total amount in replacement cables off the top of my head probably totals to about 500$+. This, with the 250$ security deposit to fix the carpet + 200$ out of pocket to fix the mattress that the apartment provides due to her shredding it, eating the insides and then vomiting into the hole, + an unknown amount of money for her jumping on top of a built-into-wall shelf in the closet and causing it to collapse...all in just 6 months... it's becoming very much for me. I live off student financial aid, and can only support their vet visits, and general care.  I am having to dig into their emergency savings to cover her damage. IVE HAD HER FOR A WHOLE YEAR!, but this behavior only started in January. She was an angel before this. 

The constant fear that she will destroy more very important things to me or the actual home keeps me from leaving the house a lot of the times. I'm thinking of rehoming her, my partner is no help, he's only giving me the ""Whatever you want to do."" thing. I just want to pull the trigger and rehome her to someone who can afford to handle this, or at the very least has no carpet. Is that an asshole move, or appropriate?",No A-holes here
AITA for crying out of line?,"There's a tl:dr; at the bottom, but I feel like you can't judge properly if you don't know the whole story.

So I (M23) have a sister (F21) and two brothers (M18) & (M15). My sister is living on her own as am I, and my brothers are still living at home. But my sister keeps being messy and my parents don't know what to do about her. They messed up earlie and they're all in holes they can't get out of. My sister feels so alone, she feels like she doesn't have a place in our family. She doesn't feel included, and it saddens me when she tells me she's ""always the last to know"". But growing up, she used to either stay in her room or feel my dad's rage, but like I was like that too, but I'm trying to better things. Like my dad isn't like that anymore, and it's not easy for me to talk to our dad either.

But things between them are still very messy. My sister parties alot, and I know I can't blame her for living for life, because even tho her grades are being messy, I have to trust her to be able to prioritize. We both went to high schools that were hard to get in, so I know she's capable. Everyone else is blaming her for partying and drinking too much. Even my girlfriend ""dude, she's drinks on a monday, tuesday and wednesday!"" I want to believe she's not failing school because she parties. But that she knows when she has time to party. I know it won't help if her brother keeps telling her to not party, like that's why she never speaks to our parents.

Like formally she's renting a 200.000$ condo our parents own. But having loud parties are annoying surrounding inhabitants and long story short she could be kicked out and my parents could lose all the money they've invested in the condo. She doesn't realise how lucky she is to have parents who support her economically like that is the narrative of our family.

And in my dream it was Christmas and my mom opened a gift from her and it was an old mp3 with probably some nostalgic tunes, but it wasn't even working and my mom got sad, and then she said ""look, she doesn't even appreciate the gift. It works, It doesn't always work, but when it works it works."" And it just broke my heart and I couldn't hold back the tears. It's 7am here in Germany but I keep reflecting. The whole dream is such an analogy. My sister pointing out my parent's emotional absence. Like they're not seeing the emotional part of her gift but focusing on the economical value of her gift. The gift's poor condition which is representing her popr condition. I never cry, I somehow only cry after I have dreams. The last time was 9 years ago when I lost her in a dream. That I was in line to cry about, but am I for this? I fear I might cry like this in fromt of her when we're both returning home for an event next week.

tl:dr; I had a dream in which my sister did something bad and it hurt our mom, and I cried because the action reflects how she's messing up her life.",No A-holes here
AITA for not wanting to hang out?,"So heres the thing I have autism. Life was kinda hard on me and when I was young I moved schools several times because it just wasn't right. The last school was verry small with only 8 others. (I came from classes with 30) 4 girls 3 boys and with me 5 girls. Even there were groups: The boys were 1 group and the girls ecxept for 1 with autism. When I saw that the girl with autism was left out I felt bad for her because I had the same multiple times but I wanted to fit in so I stayed away. The fitting in did'nt work for about a year and I decided to give it a chance with her. Just hanging out she was talking about autism alott so I thought she maybe did'nt felt comfortable around me or something so I told her I had autism to... That was a mistake. She talked about it even more and asked if I had the same it was pretty much everytime she was with me she talked about it so also when other people were around. A bit bad because I was okay with not really fitting in but was scared for being bullied because that was what happened on multiple schools when other found out. 

I was scared to say not to talk about it because I did'nt want to hurt her feelings or something but this one time we did a game: Find someone you have most in common with. The game did'nt even began en she screamed: I'LL GO WITH OP SINCE WE BOTH HAVE AUTISM.
So uhm I felt bad but I can't blame her on it since I did something like that you never know what to say and just say what you think. 

Since than everyone knew it and stayed away from me for at least 2 months but luckily everyone forgot a bit by than and talked to me again. I'm and introvert but still a human so I did'nt like it that everyone stayed at least 2 feet away from me like I had some kind of disease. I was glad people talked to me still being a bit like: ""Uhm yeah I do want to get out of here asap."" But still

I was scared it would happen again so when the girl asked me to hang out I said no and explained why. She seemed angry and sad at the same time.

It happened in elementry school it's a long time ago but I just keep thinking about if i was an a hole.

WIBTA if I go to Paris with my friends instead of going to Oxford for the second year in a row,"I was very fortunate to be one of twelve S3 (14 year old) students from my local area to get the chance to go down and stay in Exeter college in Oxford at the start of the summer- all for free!!!

The experience was A-MA-ZING and the other eleven students (and the teacher's who drove the mini bus) who I went with are the some of the best and most friendly people that I have ever met. It was one of the best experiences / weeks of my life.

Since we were the first students in Scotland  to have this experience- there is a chance that I  (along with the other eleven people) get to go back next year with a new bunch of S3s and do it all over again and guide them through it as we've already done it. I did say that it would be great to come back next year.

During the last week of term my school hosts a range of trips to a variety of places such as Holland, France, Leicester and the North West of England and you get to go to theme parks and everything. All of my friends have decided that they will be going on a trip to Paris where you get the opportunity to go to Disney land for a few days, then you get to go to the Harry Potter studios in London and you also get to see a proper musical in the West End. 

Needless to say... they are all pretty excited about it. They kept pestering me if I was coming. Initially said that I wasn't  going to but I thought it over and I know that it would be a very fun experience and I would quite like to go and have fun in le Paris avec mon amigos. 

I talked to my dad about it and he said that if I go to Oxford again I won't really be doing anything new (he never likes to go to the same place for a holiday because he wants to have new experiences) as it would just be doing the same things as last year with a bigger and new group of people. He asked me saying... ""Would I be standing in the Bodlean library thinking that I would rather be with my friends cracking it up in disney land than here doing the same thing as last year. "" 

My mum disagrees and says that I need to think about it more and that I was one of the first to go to Oxford and represent Scotland. She did earlier state (before she realised that I might be going back to Oxford) to not put off going to Paris because of the £650 cost. But I think she would rather me go to Oxford. 

I just don't want to disappoint anyone either and to not be perceived as selfish as I am not a selfish person (I am a BFG).

AITA for not trying harder to visit my Mother for my daughters sake?,"Hello reddit! Second post here, first time I was the a-hole, let's see how this one goes. 

I am the father to a lovely 6 month old daughter. She is my world and I want nothing but the best for her. Truly. My daughter gets to see her Mother's side of the family daily. This is because we have been living with them as we continue to save money before moving out permanently. My daughter loves them all and of course I do too. In the past I would travel to my Mom's house and visit for the sake of my kid (and I wanted to see her too of course). Sadly, it is rare that my Mom would travel to see us and that didn't seem to bother me until it became a regular thing. We always had to come visit her for my kid to get exposure with her Grandma. Lately though, my Mother has moved further away from us and the drive over there was adding on an additional hour each way. Honestly a total pain in the ass because I already commute a ton and I'm tired of the drive. My mom has been trying to get us to come over there and I have refused. I have asked her to come down to us instead but she hasn't directly answered my request. At this point my Mother hasn't seen my kid in over a month and it's starting to bug me. My kiddo is growing so much and I feel like she's missing out. The last time she saw her, she wasn't even crawling yet, and now She's a master at it. As I type this I'm thinking maybe I should just communicate how I feel with her but.... What do you think Reddit? Am I being unreasonable here? 

My mom is not a bad person either. She has done a lot for us, saved us from a really bad situation with my Biological Father. I am here because of her. That being said, I just want my daughter to have a better childhood than mine filled with love and family.",No A-holes here
AITA for thinking my neighbor was passive aggressive and petty?,"Long story short, I have a house on 3 acres that backs up to 4 individual back yards. Two of the four do not mow and the fence separating the 4 and me is chewed up from them letting things grow into it. They let it go for years and no one seems to care. The neighbor on the end is on the right of one that doesn't mow and they have crap growing through the fence just wrecking it.

I was mowing one day and went to avoid a turtle and my finish mower clipped the fence. I didn't realize it even hurt it. Today I go outside to mow and I notice my finish mower missing two spacers that hold one spindle on. I know they were there when I left it. I look up and the back neighbor on the north end had a chair and was sitting in his year facing me like he was waiting on a show. He had some teenager with him and eyes were glued over to my side and I am thinking what are they up to. 

I look over part of the yard for my spacers and no where to be seen and it's 3 acres so better to order new ones. Next think I know there is a big reflective sign on the back fence that says, ""Please be more careful"" And I just think it is the most passive aggressive petty thing in the world. I look over the fence and it is in the same shape it's always been. There is a chain link piece that had already been broken that was bent out a little, but I could bend it right back no issue. If he had waved me over or came over I'd have offered to just go fix it no issue.

Am I an asshole to think he is being passive aggressive and petty? I just wrote a note back (because I thought it was a little funny / ridiculous that grown man was communicating this way and I was kind of making fun of him in my own way plus I wanted to do the whole kill him with kindness.) that read, ""My fault. Thanks for keeping your fence row clear. Appreciate it. Tom"" I've never met him but I always end anything I write in my life to own it. So anyone knows I wrote it. His fence row is the cleanest besides mine but that's because I cleaned it up and sprayed it then he just kept it mowed from then on out. That why I was more annoyed than I should have been. Because I'm the one neighbor he has doing what they are supposed to and he is on me. My initial instinct was to just ignore it completely, but I am the newest here and everyone is all buddy buddy and I don't want to be that one guy everyone hates because one guy doesn't like me and spreads the hate. Plus I didn't want to have a conversation with a 60 year old man who sits in his yard waiting to get satisfaction from their neighbors reaction to a big reflective sign put up to attract everyone's attention.

AITA for not paying my roommate back for a container of hers that I broke?,"So my roommate likes to leave things on top of the shared fridge, like pasta, bread, and snacks. We have a fridge where the freezer is on top. She left for the weekend and was in a rush and apparently just shoved all her shit on top of the fridge/freezer. She must have left some stuff on the top of the closed door of the freezer. I woke up the morning after at like 5 am to get ready for school and opened the freezer, and her container of spaghetti came falling down along with her bread and bagels. Her container is [this one](https://www.amazon.com/OXO-Good-Grips-POP-Container/dp/B000UHT0MM/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1MBTC3M17YD25&keywords=tall%2Boxo%2Bcontainers&qid=1548183589&sprefix=tall%2Boxo%2B%2Caps%2C290&sr=8-2&th=1) . It broke on the bottom, just a small hole on the corner, still usable lid and stuff just a busted bottom portion.

I texted her after I did it letting her know that I broke it and she said it was fine. Today, about a week after it broke, she comes in my room and asks for money to replace the container. I was confused because she didn't seem too irritated by it before but she said the containers are expensive (they are, who the fuck pays $15 for a plastic bin and lid?) so I should pay her back.

I said I don't think I should have to pay for it because she left the container in a precarious location and I didn't do anything wrong to have caused it to be broken. She said I should have checked the top of the freezer before opening it, but that's kind of ridiculous to think to do at 5 am and also I'm 5'2"" so I can't really see the top of the freezer anyway. I also said she could just tape the hole closed on the container and it would still be usable. So now she's off in a huff and called me a cheapskate. Honestly I'll give her the cash if I'm the asshole here but I legit think no one is really in the wrong here, so I shouldn't have to pay.

AITA? 

Tl;Dr: Roommate left her $15 pasta container on top of the freezer and it fell when I opened it. I don't think I should have to pay because she is the one who left it in a dangerous spot and the container is still usable with mild repair. AITA?

AITA - The Never Ending Advice Train,"AITA - I don't know how to start this because there is a lot of history here but I'll try my best. I have lived with my brother for 5 plus years and it has gone mostly well. I love him dearly. My brother struggles with his self confidence a great deal. I try to build him up as much as i possibly can but he refuses to listen. 

I guess this is what I struggle with most. He is always asking for advice on every problem but will not take my advice. I've tried being ""the therapist"" by liistening to his concerns and taking the time to give him what I think is good sound advice. Like he has had trouble making friends. I found a couple meetups for him with people of shared interests but nothing came of it. Or he wants to start a YouTube channel. I gave him some ideas, channels to watch and places to start. That was 2 years ago and he's still wanting more ideas. I could go on and on, he just ignores it all. He'll get it off of his chest and then a week later he's back asking me for more advice. One day it's his job, another his finances, another his sex life, another, etc. It's like an endless river of complaints. I've tried the tough love route bytelling him to man up and stop complaining but that got me nowhere. I've gotten so drained emotionally that I've spend a few days holed up in my room trying to avoid him. *Side Note-I'm an introvert by nature and things like this can easily drain me. Also I have depression and anxiety so sometimes it just adds to it because I just take on his problems.* Does avoiding him work? No, he's woken me up at night in tears because of his problems....three times. It's been the same broken record for five years. These are all easy changes he can make but he refuses to make them. He doesn't have many friends so I feel this contributes to his loneliness but then again he chooses not to go out and find friends.

It all came to a head today. I just couldn't take it anymore and told him to never ask for my advice again if he wasn't going to take it. I told him he needed to see a real therapist and unless he was going to pay me 200 a hour then go away. Now I feel so guilty that I erupted. I don't know if he's depressed, anxious or just lazy. I've asked him many times and encouraged him to talk to a doctor. It fell on deaf ears. AITA?",No A-holes here
AITA my mom is constantly passive aggressively bashing my aunt,"I work a high stress 50-60 hr per week job and am required to travel. I have too sweet children that I love more than anything. They are 4 soon to be 5 and 6.

She is the kind of woman who would give you her last dime if you needed it. And she has always loved children, babysat when I was a kid had foster kids etc.

Well I have been feeling animosity between her and my mother for years but his week it kind of reached a head.

My sons birthday and my husband's birthday are one week apart. We are  having the birthday party for him at my moms one house (which she does not live at or have any possessions there and is right next door to my aunts house)  bc there is more room there. Well my folding chairs were up there and I asked my aunt (who was my live in nanny when I was a kid for a number of years) if she could swing up quick and grab 4 of them because my husband's birthday is today and his family and a handful of his friends were coming over. Gave my aunt-who is my dads sister and who helped raise me the key to her house to grab the chairs.

Within 15 minutes my mom who was at work is texting me.

Who did you give the key to my house ?  Someone was in  ?

 I was getting some chairs out dropped the drink thing off

You ?  

Con. Why?

My mom ( my gram) went to check it. Said someone was in there wet tracks on the floor. How about you just use the key then we will have no more issues ! 

(There were no wet tracks on the floor. The chairs were right inside the front door next to the rug that my aunt wiped her feet on. Did I also mention my aunt is like the cleanest person on the face of the planet ?)

If people respected other people we would not have this 

Then my mom proceeded to text my aunt and told her 

That Emily (thats me) is the only one to be using the key to her house.

WIBTA for not going to my boyfriend’s brother’s wedding in Italy?,"I’m going to try to make this as short as possible but there are a lot of important details lol. 

So first I just want to give a little bit of back story: 

My boyfriend (27M) and I (25F) have been together for almost 5 years. Our anniversary is next month. 

My boyfriend’s brother, Mitch (30M) and his girlfriend, Ashley (29F) have been together for 2 years. 

My boyfriend’s other brother, Tom (29M), and his fiancé, Alexis (27F) have been together for over 10 years and they are getting married in Italy this September. 

We live in the US. 

Alexis and I used to be fairly close, but we had an argument a while back that we never got over. I was pregnant at the time and ended up having a miscarriage and she told my boyfriend’s family that she thought I was lying about ever being pregnant. She still, to this day, swears I lied about being pregnant and when I asked her why she believes that, she said, “I have a masters degree in psychology. I can tell when people are lying.” So for the past 2 years, we have just always stayed civil at family events but we stay out of each other’s way. 

When they announced that they were getting married in Italy and it would be a 10 day trip and they expected the whole family to be there, my boyfriend and I were already annoyed because we planned to take a long vacation elsewhere for our anniversary this year. We aren’t able to do both because of money and not having enough PTO at our jobs. But we decided to get over it since it’s their wedding and it’s more important than our anniversary trip. 


When we received the wedding invitation, it only said my boyfriend’s name. But on the RSVP website, it gave him an option for a plus one. So I just assumed that it would be the same for my boyfriend’s brother Mitch’s invitation. But his actually said “Mitch and Ashley” on the invitation and the website. 

So my boyfriend asked Tom why my name wasn’t on there but Ashley’s was, and Tom said there must have been some kind of mistake with the company they used for the invites. But he told my boyfriend that I was invited too. 

Then a few weeks later, Mitch and Ashley told my boyfriend and I that Alexis told them she purposely did not put my name on the invitation because she doesn’t like me and she thought it would be funny. 

I feel like that’s a really immature and petty thing to do and I don’t want to spend thousands of dollars on a 10 day trip to Italy for someone’s wedding who disrespects me like that. 

WIBTA for not going?

I hope this is enough info! Please feel free to ask any questions :-)


******UPDATE:
Okay so I don’t use Reddit very often so I’m not sure the best way to update this, like if I should comment or just keep it at editing the post haha. 

But I’ve decided to leave it up to my boyfriend like some of you suggested! 

He said if I don’t go to Italy, he is definitely not going without me and that’s okay with him. But then when we started talking about how we were going to tell his brother, I noticed how anxious he got and I felt horrible. 

So then I suggested he sit down & talk to his brother about us going to Italy but ONLY going to the rehearsal and the wedding, and us taking the rest of our vacation separately from them. And obviously explain to his brother why we don’t feel comfortable doing more with them. 

And we agreed that was a good plan. But my bf said if his brother reacts poorly in anyway during their conversation, we will not go to Italy at all and we’ll go to Costa Rica instead 🥰

I know this kind of a crappy update so I can give another one after they talk but I have no clue when that will be 😂

*Also I just wanted to thank everyone for your suggestions and taking the time to write out so many thoughtful and helpful responses. It’s really so relieving to feel heard and understood. 

But in addition to that, thank you so so SO much for all of the condolences. I don’t talk about my miscarriage very often, or really at all unless I’m talking about what Alexis accused me of, so I can’t really even remember the last time someone has gone out of their way to comfort me about it. And then to have so many of you, who don’t even know me, take the time to say such loving & kind words- you just have no idea how much that means to me. Thank you thank you thank you 🫶🏼🤍",Not the A-hole
AITA for throwing away soda bottles?,"My brother and I are avid diet soda drinkers. Between the two of us, we consume a minimum of four two-liter bottles per day. We pay for all this soda ourselves. We also live with our parents. Here's where the problem comes in.

In the place we live, there is a deposit on soda bottles. Basically, you pay a five cent tax on every bottle of soda you purchase, and you get that money back by bringing the bottles to a redemption center. The deposit program is archaic. It was designed to encourage recycling 50 years ago, when recycling was not common. Nowadays, every town in our area has biweekly recycling pickup. You put out your plastics and cardboard and whatnot, and the town takes it away. It is way more convenient than lugging your empty bottles to a redemption center and feeding them into the machine one by one. Problem is, if you recycle your bottles via pickup, you lose the deposit.

My mom does not like it when I put the soda bottles - that I paid for - in the recycling. If she sees them, she will fish them out and scream at me about how I'm ""throwing away nickels"". The thing is, she doesn't recycle the bottles at anywhere near the rate at which they accumulate. The basement is currently piled up with garbage bags full of bottles that she claims she's going to recycle, but hasn't. Last month, she had me bring up six garbage bags full of bottles from the basement and she swore she was going to recycle them. They sat in the living room for two weeks then went back to the basement because I was sick of looking at them.

This morning I snuck 60 soda bottles into our recycling bins and dumped other recycling on top of them so she couldn't see. I plan to do this every recycling day until they're gone. AITA?

AITA for cancelling a date the day before and not responding to messages during the weekend?,"Hi! Sorry,lots of context.

I (32F) have never been in a relationship (strict childhood, low self esteem, being overall conventionally unattractive). At my age that's kinda weird/concerning when considering me as a possible partner, so I try not to mention it and do lie when asked. It's easier than explaining.

As I do not get much attention irl, I sometimes go on random anonymous sites just to interact. Usually not sexual, but I have gotten there. 

2 weeks ago I got a call with a dude I really liked. After a 3 hour call, things did get sexual - but it was only voice chat.

He left me his email address and tho I had my reservations,I saved it because we connected pretty well. He said no pressure but that was his email and he was open.

After days thinking, I emailed him, because I don't usually allow myself to be vulnerable and that has hindered chances of even good friendships before. I messaged him clarifying a few aspects of my looks, and other things - If I was starting a friendship/relationship, I wanted things to be clear from the start. 

Chatting started and we had more calls, I have learned more about his life and work and I continue to like him. 

We planned a ""virtual date"" on Sat, with video. On Friday we had a cute call after which I googled him (I was curious and had learned new info), and immediately had doubts. I told him and he said this is not my name and email, sorry. I thanked him for the honesty and stopped texting. A few hours later I texted him explaining why this was sad to learn for me, and why I thought he had missed the chance to be more honest with me. Wished him a great weekend (implicitly cancelling the date). 

He sent me 11 messages hours later. None of them are remotely apologetic. He explained everything else was genuine and his reasons, which I completely understand as he mentioned holding kind of an important position at work, but would just have appreciated a bit more clarity -like ""hey! This is not my real name, I don't trust you yet but would love to continue to get to meet you"" -it's not only consensual but lets the other know where they stand.

Maybe I'm asking for too much, but now I feel silly because there has always been a side holding more power. If things went south and he got angry, he could actually fuck me up professionally and I wouldn't even know who shot. He only has my email, but you can get enough info.

This is completely on me, I know I should have been more careful. I just thought that was kind of the charm of the case, I might not be an exec level but have things to lose as well, so it was like a mutual risk to show vulnerability and interest. Assuming the above is also on me. I communicated this and apologized for the assumption. I don't have much experience.

I have not gotten back to him. I think it would be respectful to respond, but feel like zero apologies in 11 messages is kind of a red flag already. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not requesting a friend doesn’t contact an exes employer?,"Throwaway because of implications and all. I’m going to keep it vague but also try to give enough info. Some background. I am divorced and my ex recently obtained a job working with children. I have a friend who was very present in my life during the entire divorce/custody battle that ensued that I’m still close with. The issue here is my ex had CPS (child protective services) findings of abuse and neglect against our child that were substantiated but the local district attorneys office didn’t prosecute for some pretty stupid reasons(sheriffs office filed charges, DA didn’t want to proceed). Now, my ex has started working recently with kids at a new employer but the findings wouldn’t have shown up on a background check because this all happened in another state. I stay in touch with this friend often and expressed my concern with my exes new position while also being worried about the fallout of exposing the history. 

Today my friend contacted my exes employer and made them aware of the CPS findings. I’m not upset about that. Either my ex was open and honest about it or purposely withheld CPS findings during the hiring process is my thought process. I told my current significant other, who we have been together for a while, and my significant other was very upset. Granted, I’m the only one in the relationship with children and I’d be mortified to find out that someone working with my kid had this background. My significant other is more of the “let the past be the past” kind of person where I only agree with that when real change has been observed. I also feel incredibly uncomfortable with knowing my ex is around children in a professional capacity but feel that the employment choice is a dumb decision from my ex given the history. 

Now my significant other is pretty ticked off at me and the whole situation because I didn’t stop my friend nor did I disagree with that action. Am I the asshole here?

EDIT (to amplify information): I am the father of our child, ex is mom. My friend had mentioned doing this before and I mentioned I felt the employer should know but wasn’t sure that it was a good choice or not.",Not the A-hole
AITA for insisiting son get a PT job?,"Second attempt at posting since bot didn't think I put in enough info.

Ok so here’s the context. Our son transferred from one university to another and was living with us after leaving the first school. The second university is local but he insisted he needed to have his own place for his sanity. He received a small student loan to cover tuition but that’s all the cash he has and he has no job. I offered to help him out by co-signing on a student line of credit and being a guarantor on an apartment. He stated he only wanted to take the offer if it was essentially no strings attached and that I wouldn't ever 'hold this over his head'. I agreed with that but stated that the only condition was that he get a part time job to help cover the interest on the loan and maybe some of his incidentals. He agreed to that condition so we went ahead and got him the line of credit and I signed on his apartment. 

Well it’s been three + months now and he’s saying it’s impossible to get a job in this market right now (Ontario, Canada). I may be out of touch here but with the unemployment rate being what it is I figured getting a simple part time job wouldn’t be too hard. I have therefore given him a deadline one month from now to get a job otherwise I will need to change our arrangement. I said I’d continue to pay the rent for him and he’d need to find ways to cover the other costs.

Long explanation I know but here’s the question. Could I be the asshole for changing the terms since he can’t seem to find any from of part time job? Should I just believe that he's trying as hard as he can and the part-time job market sucks in Ontario or should I expect him to meet his part of the agreement?",Not the A-hole
WIBTA Tell my mom not to invite her plumber to my wedding,"I (28M) am getting married in June. My parents are divorced, dad got remarried, mom is still single. Fiancés parents are together.

We haven't sent invites yet but when i was talking with my mom (52F) about the wedding she brought up already inviting her plumber as her plus one (specifically not a date!). I don't know the guy, and feel it would be extremely weird for him to be invited to an small wedding intended for close friends and family. To note because of an argument between her and us about cost it forced us to change the date and size of the wedding to be smaller with only close friends and family.

My mom moved to TN last august because ""no datable men live in this area"" (i swear this is what she said the day she told me she was moving). Before this my mom was having a fling or something along those lines with a plumber in the area. Its honestly a weird situation because of how she describes him as undatable but would go see him as a  masseurs. They had gone on a few boating trips to lakes but he was still described as undatable. my guess is that he is in some weird fuck buddy situation. If she had been dating him long term or met someone in TN I wouldn't have an issue as long as I met him before hand and he wasnt an asshole like her previous BFs.

The other issue I have aside from him coming is that she has been adamite about inviting some cousin that ive never met to my wedding. Before she told me about the plumber, my thought is that if she want to have this cousin at the wedding that she was going to be her plus one.

Playing devils advocate my only thought for her is that she feels she would be alone or the only single one at the wedding if she didn't bring someone but her/my entire family 20+ people will be there. My family makes up a majority of the guests so its hard for me to sympathize with her in this point.

AITA for defending my boyfriend in front of friends and telling them he won't apologize to them for anything?,"My bf 32 M is not popular with some of my friends while others like him a lot. There seems to be a mixed reaction to him even though he's a very good, adorable human being.

Just a few days ago my boyfriend and my friends were together and having a great time when one of them, let's call him ""J"" said loudly that he had heard something about my bf's past and asked him what he heard was true.

J did this in front of everyone and the whole party went quite and started listening.

I tried to diffuse the situation and said ""okay let it go, let's do this some other time"". But J repeated his question loudly and my bf looked dead serious and simply said yes it's true.

The other friends in our group suddenly seemed to pounce on him saying, ""OMG how could you do such a thing, WTF is wrong with you,"", etc. etc. I told them in no uncertain terms that the part of his life ended more than a decade ago, why bring it up now when he's changed.

Others are adamant that they can't see him the say way after this and that he needs to apologize to them. I was like apologize for what? My bf was quite throughout the whole thing as he was undoubtedly sad and even regretful.

I told J he was stupid for bringing this up in front of everyone and that if he had any issues he should have addressed them privately. J said he did what he thought was right and he didn't regret it.

My bf and I walked out of there and since have ignored their calls and messages. But I have been bombadred with snarky and downright gloating messages about how my friends were right that my bf wasn't good for me, that I was making a huge mistake, and that my bf needs to apologize to them, etc.

I really want to let this go but I made things worse by replying and telling them all off. Now a bunch of them won't talk to me and the others are mad I escalated things.

So I don't know if I'm the asshole here for actually defending my bf and not staying quite for the sake of keeping peace.

PS. My bf isn't and wasn't involved in any sort of crime.

**PSS. Since everyone are saying there's not enough info I'd like to come clean and tell you that my bf was involved with a bunch of racist, nationalist English guys some of whom had neo nazi affliations (my bf never did). And me and my friends are all brown. This was several years ago he's not the same now.**",Not enough info
AITA for yelling at a classmate because they hid my stuff and were reading through my journal?,"So this happened yesterday, 8th period of school. I (13f) got to class early, like usual and I set my stuff down, went to get some water and came back. 

I didn't notice at first but my stuff got taken by a kid in my class... He (13m) tried to hide my stuff and act all innocent. Apparently he admitted to doing it. When I asked him why, he said ""cause it's funny"" when it wasn't. I have anger issues, so when people were yelling at me, I got upset and started yelling back. My class got our first strike (my teacher does a 3 strike system where if you get 3 strikes as a class then y'all get punished) and everyone was blaming me so I said if Wyatt (the kid who took my stuff) didn't do that we wouldn't have gotten it.

I also never got my journal back, all my other stuff I did though. Apparently Wyatt was looking through it. So I took it and then lost it. After school I went to my locker to grab something before going home, and Wyatt was by me so I flipped him off and called him a bitch. He had no right to go through my stuff. I feel like TA but I feel like Wyatt is one too. So, am I the AH? (Not enough info probably but it's 7:20am and I can't remember crap)",Not the A-hole
AITA for not warning someone and intentionally got them hurt?,"I know the title sounds bad but please hear me out. I (18M) went to my class at the workshop at my college, today half of our class had to do Arc Welding and the other half did Gas Welding. I was tasked to do the latter half. Now one thing I have to mention is that there are 8 Welding Tables for Gas Welding, no labels or signs that say ‘1’ ‘2’ ‘3’ ‘4’ ‘5’ ‘6’ ‘7’ ‘8’. But the table I worked at was under a sign that said ‘Gas Welding Area’ (this is important). So after welding together 2 pieces of metal using an Electrode you need to wait for it to cool down before you attempt to pick it up (it cools down in 10-15 minutes) I waited 7 minutes and tried to pick it up and of course I scolded my index finger (yes I know I was impatient that one is on me). I also need to mention that I worked later than the people I was working along side with cause the store was a bit busy and I needed a few electrodes to weld the pieces together (me being a bit late is key factor here). So after I went to the store to get a cream to treat my finger, I see another student sitting at the table I was working at (we’ll call them DG just cause), and this is how the conversation went:

Me: “hey, you need something?”

DG: “no, thank you.”

Me: “this is my table, mind if I sit here?”

DG: “this is actually my table, maybe you got ours mixed up?”

Me: “no my table was under this sign, and thats my work over there, you’re the one who got them confused.”

They insisted that they were waiting for this piece to cool down for 15 minutes now and told me to fuck off. At this point I was irritated and decided fine, I’ll play along. I told them ok they should show it off to the tutor so they see if they did it correctly or not. They of course, picked it up with their hand and instantly screamed in pain from holding a welded piece of metal. I told them they should rush to the store to treat their hand, then I went back to my table and waited for our next task.

At the end of the class we were all dismissed and they came up to me and berated me for not warning them the piece of metal was hot. I told them they had it coming for not listening to me and ignoring me saying that it was my table. One other classmate told me I was out of line for doing that. So I’m wondering, AITA? If I am put me in my place and during my next class I’ll apologise to them.

Edit: I should clarify, gloves were provided to Arc Welding students but not to Gas Welding students. No clue why but it was just that.

Edit 2: I forgot to mention, when I told them to show it off to my tutor, I was pointing to my tutor so I didn’t see them grabbing the metal piece, and also I found out later there was a tool we could have used to grab it off the table, now I feel both us are morons for not using it lol

Edit 3 (god damn I didn’t give enough info): I wanted the tutor to come since our tutor actually helped me with something in this task and then tell the tutor “who was sitting at this table?” And we’d see who was lying.",Not the A-hole
AITA for humiliating my nephew's math teacher?,"Long time lurker, only recently started posting on reddit and I could use an outside opinion on this.

I love my nephew(M17) as if he were my own. He's a really good kid, but not the best student. He's by no means a dumb kid but he'd much rather be spending time with his friends than doing his homework. Which I totally understand; I felt the same way at his age. However, I also want him to have the opportunity to get into college, so I've been tutoring him in math and physics.

Last week I got a call from his father saying he failed his most recent test. That was a shock since he really seemed to get it when we were studying for the test. I went over to their house after work to go over what he got wrong. When I saw the test the first thing that stood out was that most of the answers were correct. My nephew told me that he lost points because the teacher didn't accept his work shown. My nephew then told me that his teacher wanted to speak with his parents about the test since it was a large part of his grade and this would jeopardize it. I spoke with his father and we agreed that I'd go in.

Last Wednesday, I met my nephew after school and we went to his teacher's classroom. My nephew had told her that I was his uncle and math tutor after class and she was combative from the outset. Accusing me of teaching him incorrectly and doing more harm than good. I'm a logistics consultant and wrote my PhD thesis on high level mathematics. Needless to say, hearing this made me rather nonplussed. After her tirade I asked her what exactly was ""incorrect"" about the method I had taught him. She fumbled a bit and before she could say anything I asked her what her degree was in. What made her method the ""correct"" one and if she could rigorously prove that, because I could prove that the method I taught would yield the correct answer. I then told her that I had a PhD in an applied math field and that doing math was my job. She was very upset and said that it was her class and that meant my nephew had to do it her way. I told her to get the math department head or if she'd rather I could go to the principal's office instead. We ended up going back and forth for a while until a teacher interrupted. I had written out the proof on the board and this teacher asked what the commotion was. My nephew's teacher explained the situation and the other teacher looked at my proof for a minute before saying that I was correct. He apologized to me and told my nephew that he'd get his grade fixed.

I went home and told my wife this, expecting her to calm me down. But instead she told me that I shouldn't have been so tough with her or brought up my degree and that I humiliated her in front of her colleague. I don't think I was in the wrong since my nephew's teacher was being unreasonable, but my wife is both smarter than me and the one who keeps me in line so I'm unsure.

So, AITA for humiliating my nephew's teacher?

Edit: The class is AP calculus AB

Edit 2: I have read most of the responses here and I will try and reply to as many as I can, but I am very glad that so many people have given their opinions. I was limited by the character limit in the original post, so I admit that it read like a “and everyone clapped” story. And I apologize for not putting enough info. I’m not a writer and if I had asked my wife to proof read, it would have been more clear. Both of us have read through the comments and come to the conclusion that while putting my nephew first was the correct thing to do, I really could’ve handled it better. Therefore, contrary to the popular opinion, I believe I acted like an ass in the heat of the moment. 

For those of you asking about the specifics of the test: the method to be used was not specified and the test was on related rates and implicit differentiation. Why those two were on the same test, I still have no clue. I taught my nephew to treat them as a multivariable function and to derive with respects to t. Instead of deriving with respects to x as was taught in his book. I will explain in more detail in the comments for those that asked. 

My wife explained that her initial reaction was based on the fact I did it with my nephew present. I undermined the teacher’s authority in front of a student. And based on the comments from teachers, was a ahole move especially considering the pandemic. For the record, I did not enjoy humiliating her. It was rather upsetting and frustrating and the only enjoyment from it was having my nephew get the grade he earned.",Not the A-hole
AITA for pulling out of my sister's wedding due to her inlaws?,"**Stop PMing me. I will not respond. I don't care how many people want me to drop my sister, I am overwhelmed as it is by all of this. And especially stop messaging me because AITA banned you.**


For background, Stella and I are identical twins, 29F and we will both be 30 when her wedding comes around this fall. I had her as my maid of honor 8 years ago and she promised me that I could be hers when her wedding came around.

I have 2 kids, 6F and 3F. They're the flower girls.

My marriage fell apart just over two years ago, due to a stillbirth and my husband's infidelity. My parents and sister were the only reason I didn't drown from the stress, loneliness, and total abandonment of my spouse. I was a total mess.

I went to therapy, got diagnosed with bipolar disorder and depression, quit drinking, and I owe a lot of it to my amazing sister. She's the reason why I kept chasing down my ex for child support when he stopped suddenly paying (he suddenly switched from ""world's best dad"" to ""deadbeat dumbass"" so quickly that my ex MIL is disgusted with him)

Stella and Jon 35M engaged last year. His parents are paying about 60% of the wedding. Our parents are paying 30% Stella and Jon paying for the rest themselves.

The biggest caveat is that they **must** be married in Jon's family's church, full mass with communion. The family is on board because this is going to be a very big wedding.

Tonight, Stella had invited me to dinner, as they had finally reserved a date for the church and reception, assuming it was to formally ask me to be her MOH. I was excited since I haven't been in a wedding party aside from my own wedding.

Jon was with her, weird because Stella didn't mention him coming at all in our texts about the dinner. We hugged like usual but Jon didn't. Weirder.

After we got our drinks, they got to it. In a nutshell, Jon expressed the following: ""Despite my best efforts to keep it secret, my parents found out that you're divorced when they asked why your husband wasn't coming. They are no longer comfortable with you as MOH, because it won't look good to the church if my family hears about the divorce. You can be a bridesmaid but can't mention the divorce or your conditions at all during the wedding events.""

I was stunned, and I felt tears in my eyes. Stella started crying too and she tried to spin it in a good way. ""This is way less stressful for you, so it's a good thing! MIL has already approved my BFF as my MOH, so please don't make this any harder.""

I knew that I couldn't possibly stay there through an entire meal. I had to process this new info alone. I didn't speak. I just paid for my wickedly expensive cocktail, and left to order an Uber home.

A few hours ago, I texted Stella that I would not be in her wedding party at all. That was my decision. I wouldn't pull my daughters out, but I would only attend as a guest.

She wouldn't take this as an answer, so I had to temp block her due to her excessive texts and calls. I sent my parents a summary of what happened and promised to call them when I was in better shape tomorrow.

Stella thinks that this is a total overreaction. I don't even want to know what Jon thinks at this point.

Please help me. AITA?

Edit: Thank you for all the responses. I half expected to be told to just put up with it and be a plain bridesmaid, which while difficult I kinda would have forced myself to just to make Stella happy. I was just so blindsided and I feel like I've been gut-punched, and I do need to be told if I am overreacting in a big way sometimes.

I'm going to fall asleep now while binging Friends. And wonder if my twin has suddenly become an Ursula instead of Phoebe...

Edit 2: Wow. I did not expect this to blow up. I can't thank everyone enough for their input.

I have a call scheduled with my parents this afternoon (from what I gathered, they are extremely upset with Stella and Jon at the moment) Depending on how that goes, I will talk to my girls about doing something big and fun instead. The more I think about it, sitting through a mass sounds less and less appealing. I'm not even religious.

WIBTA For contacting the manager?,"I'm on mobile; sorry for any formatting issues. I'm also using a throwaway, because I don't want this on my main.

So, I recently procured a specialized medical service. This service had been part of a bigger med situation, & the results were to be immediately sent back to the Dr on the other side of the building.

At their the front desk, the secretaries gave me a printed cost estimate, as billed through my insurance. When I brought up that the est. was higher than my plan should charge, they said ""If you paid through 'personal pay,' it would be (1/2 the price,) & that (est. price) is an estimate of paying through your insurance- the cost could be higher or lower. Looking at your plan (I had pulled up my coverage info) it looks like through your insurance it'll be a bit less than the estimate.""

They also mentioned that the patients don't pay immediately- ""payments would go through billing"" & you'd be able to set up a payment plan & pay later.

I left after the service was done, & went back to the other section of the building to wait for the main dr.

Afterward, I went to the main checkout desk to pay for the other med service (the larger situation was already paid for.) They said to go back to the other section's front desk to pay.

I went back, & said ""I'm ready to pay; I'd like to pay in cash now through personal pay.""

They told me my insurance had already been billed, & any payment method changes would have had to have been done before the service was done.

I was never given that option- that I would have had to decide & pay before the service was completed. They said that they weren't even supposed to give me a pers.pay quote since I had insurance, it was done out of generosity, & there was nothing that could be done to change it now.

I went to my car, upset, & decided to call around & see if they were telling the truth. I called the customer service for the business over the entire building, & for the secretaries' company. I also went back into the main bldg & asked about the billing policies of the main company & its affiliates.

Everyone said I should've had the option on whether to pay through insurance or not, & the front desk people should have told me of my choices before anything else.

I went back in, & confronted the two secretaries & asked for the manager's number. They claimed they did tell me If have to decide upfront, & refused the manager's number. After one left to ""get the manager for the bldg"" & then came back (alone) they said ""just give OP their email."" I looked up the manager's name from the email & now have their number too.

WIBTA If I don't go to my ex-bestfriends wedding,"For a little backstory my ex best friend and I befriended each other at 10 years old, both M(we're 26 now) we were inseparable until I met a girl and started seriously dating her at 19. He only met her once and never wanted me to bring her around and stopped coming over or even talking to me. I was really hurt and tried getting us together but he was always busy. He eventually found a nice woman and started dating her and I was happy for him. This was when we were 21/22 and he stopped talking to me at all. Fast forward and between 22 to now (26) we have only talked once and he messages me saying he wants me at his wedding and I was standoffish but didn't decline.

AITA for telling my in future in-laws that it's not a wedding gift unless it's given to both people and telling my fiancee I don't want to live in a house I don't own?,"My fiancee \[27F\] and I \[29M\] grew up very differently. I was an immigrant who moved here when I was 6, and we were definitely struggling a lot. My parents worked extremely hard to provide for me and siblings, and they always prioritized our education over everything. My dad always told me it was his dream to live in a house that he owned, since we'd always rented, but he couldn't save up enough since we were renting in expensive areas with good schools. Unfortunately, both of my parents passed away before being able to realize that dream. My dad passed away when I was 17 and my mom passed away almost 3 years ago due to covid.

My fiancee grew up fairly wealthy. Like private schools, designer clothes, 3-4 international vacations per year flying first or business class the whole way. I was able to attend college thanks to student loans, scholarships, and part-time jobs, which delayed my graduation a bit, while her parents were able to fairly easily cover all expenses themselves. However, I'm the last person to say that my fiancee hasn't earned everything she's gotten. She's an extremely intelligent person, and besides funding her education, her parents are in no way responsible for her accomplishments.

My fiancee and I met 6 years ago when we started working at the same company, in the same position, at the same time, after graduating from college. We hit it off almost instantly and it didn't take long for us to start dating. Both of us still work at the company, however I've progressed through the career ladder a bit more quickly than she has and now make just over twice what she does. I'll be the first to admit that this is completely undeserved and I've benefitted from a lot of luck and definitely some sexism as well, since we work in a male-dominated field. Still, that has allowed me to aggressively attack my student loans, and once they were payed off, I put that into saving up for a down payment on a house as a way to fulfill my parents dreams.

I proposed about 6 months, and things have been great so far. However, this past weekend, we were at her family's house, when her parents told us that for a wedding present, they were going to give us a house. My fiancee was overjoyed, and although I was also happy, I wanted to know the details as well. Pretty quickly, her parents told us that the house would be in her name only, and that they expected us to sign a prenup to protect any (and only) pre-marriage assets ""just in case"". I was insulted that they thought I was after their money at all since I make more than she does anyway, and I ended up telling them that they can't call it a wedding present if they only give it to one person. I then told my fiancee I refused to live in a house that I don't own, and she knows exactly why. All three of them got very upset with me. So AITA?

**Edit/Update:** So I was requested to add some information that I included in the comments into my post, and I also just had a long conversation with my fiancee and my in-laws, so I have a small update to share as well.

Here's the info from the comments: 

>The hilarious part of the whole prenup conversation was that they basically said that they expected the prenup to only cover premarital and inherited assets. They said they would absolutely refuse to accept any clauses that include future assets. So if I want to own a home where only my name is on the title, I have to purchase it before the marriage and also make sure to never use any of my wife's money to pay the mortgage or anything. Apparently they already had their lawyer write the whole thing up, but wanted to give me a heads-up so I can retain my own lawyer to review it. I have a suspicion that any lawyer is going to think it's massively unfair just base on how they've described it, and I'm assuming that they think I'll just get a cheap lawyer because of my upbringing. Admittedly, I don't know any better, so this is kind of difficult for me to determine what's fair and isn't fair here, but it doesn't seem fair to me.  
>  
>Besides that though, it's also just a personal thing. I want to live in a house that I own. Not them. Not my wife alone. I'm happy to live in a home that both my wife and I own, but not one she owns on her own. I don't someone else living in the home that I own. I want to live in it myself.

I also should mention that currently, my fiancée and I share our finances. She makes about 120k use and I make about 250k usd. We split things according to income, so I pay around two-thirds and she pays around one-third. Based on our conversations, my fiancee and I both expected this arrangement to continue after marriage.

As for the update, well I'll start with my fiancee's older sister \[29F if it's relevant\] calling me out of the blue a few hours ago to tell me that her parents did not ask her husband to sign a prenup before they got married. Both of my fiancee's sisters and my fiancee's BIL were at the dinner where her parents talked about the house, so they both heard the whole conversation. My fiancee's sister thought I deserved to know. My fiancee's BIL comes from a well-off family as well, but I don't know how well-off or whether they are on the same level as my fiancee's family or just upper middle class. Their wedding was pretty extravagant. My fiancée's family is white and American, as is the BIL. I am Pakistani. I don't believe her parents are racist, but it seemed like this information was important according to the comments.

Anyway, about 3 hours ago, my fiancee finally came home. She had stayed at her parent's house because we'd gotten into quite the argument. I was expecting her to continue the argument, but she actually came and apologized straight away. Apparently her younger sister \[22F\] chewed her out after I left her parent's house. She really laid into my fiancee on how she was being inconsiderate because everyone knew how important owning my home was to me. She also said that her parents weren't treating me right, or equally. That made my fiancee see my side, as she said, but she was too embarrassed, which is why she didn't come home last night. If you can't tell, I'm a huge fan of my fiancee's little sister right now. She's always been a sort of no-nonsense firecracker type of girl, while my fiancee is a bit of a people pleaser and definitely a Daddy's girl, and she's kind of always vying for her father's approval. My fiancée has even said she knows she needs to work through that before we get married. I'm going to buy her sister a cupcake.

Then showed her the post and she got pretty uncomfortable reading a lot of the comments, especially the ones saying that she doesn't care about me. She also got really uncomfortable when she read the comments about her parents being racist. I pressed on that a bit and she went on to mention that they've never been overtly racist, but they did make comments when we first started dating about being concerned about future, specifically about our children looking different and being treated poorly by her family. They asked her many times if she was sure about me. Like I said, I don't believe they're racist, but I do understand that they probably have some biases. This was also the case when they said they didn't want to do any traditional Pakistani events for the wedding. That was fine for me anyway, so I didn't really care, but now it makes me think a bit.

I explained to her how I was feeling like I was going into this as an unequal partner, and she absolutely agreed that it wasn't fair. She even said she was going to tell her parents that she was going to refuse to sign the prenup. I told her to slow down, because she was going between extremes. I told her that we still needed to get the prenup because her family was already having difficulty accepting me and this was going to make it worse. However, I told her that under no circumstances was I signing anything her parents had a part in drafting, and that we would each retain our own lawyers outside of her parents' influence and get something that is fair and equitable. She agreed.

We then talked about the house, and she said she was going to tell her parents that she wasn't going to accept unless both of our names were on it. I told her to slow down again, and I got her to agree to me paying for a quarter of it. My initial proposal was to pay half, but she said that what I said about it being a wedding present so it should be for both of us was true. So we came to the agreement that we would each get half ownership of the house, with her parents paying for 75% of it and me using the money I have saved plus a small mortgage for the other 25%. Both of our names will be on the title.

We then called her parents together and told them our plan. They grumbled about it a bit initially, especially because her dad was still upset that I had been so ungrateful, but eventually, we were able to talk it through, and they agreed to the plan. I doubt that this is the last I hear about this, but at least for now, it seems like the situation is mostly resolved.",Not the A-hole
AITA for taking my daughter with brain damage to Disney and possibly “ruining” other people’s trips?,"A little backstory:

My (25F) toddler (3F) was born with brain damage. It causes her to have difficulty understanding a lot of things. She also can’t talk. Her only form of communication is screaming/crying. She also makes very loud noises when she is happy. I want to make this very clear, no amount of discipline or teaching her will ever help with this.

But despite all her difficulties, she has fallen in love with all things Disney. Because of this, I decided to take her to Disney. I did my best to prepare for things. I planned the rides she could do around times that would be less busy. I brought toys and activities to distract her through wait times. But things happen.

We’d had people be rude to us and her all day long, mostly little things. A group of teenage girls pointed, laughed, and even took pictures of my daughter as she did her best to eat her lunch. People rolled their eyes at us and made snide comments as she attempted to carry every stuffed Disney toy she saw.

But my final straw was when we were waiting in line for the Toy Story Alien ride. She was able to see the ride from where we were in line, so of course she started getting antsy. I did my best to distract her, but I was failing. She couldn’t wait any longer. When the line wasn’t moving, she started to scream in frustration. I picked her up to comfort her but that made things worse. She started screaming louder and thrashing around. People were staring and talking about her under their breath. “She needs to control her kid.” “That’s just ridiculous. Why bring your kid if they act like that?” Finally someone said, “A swift spanking will fix that.” I’d had enough and snapped that she had brain damage and she couldn’t help it. I got so upset that we just ended up leaving.

At first I thought they were the AH but after hearing a friend’s opinion, I’m beginning to question myself. They said her screaming is unpleasant and it possibly ruined people’s day. So AITH?

Edit: Thank you all. You’ve made me feel so much better and have given me the courage to return to Disney with my daughter. I just need to stop feeling guilty for us having a place in the world. Also thank you for all your advice! I wish I was given that info from the beginning.

Edit #2: I responded this to someone else, but now feel it is necessary to add here. “Believe me, I know how annoying and frustrating (agonizing even) it can be to listen to her scream. I do it every single day. I listen to it until I want to make myself go deaf so I don’t have to hear it anymore. But despite all of that, I have compassion towards her and to any other parent experiencing what I experience. I understand in ways parents of normal kids don’t. I feel immensely guilty the moment she starts screaming in public. This is why I do my best to take her to places where there aren’t really any people. But I knew Disney would be somewhere she’d truly be happy. So I took her. I guess if that makes me the AH, then so be it. I just want my daughter to feel like she deserves to go anywhere she wants. After reading all these supportive comments, I’m sorry if other people find us annoying but I’m not taking away from her anymore.” Thanks to those that showed support.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I tell my brother what my salary is so he knows there are better job options out there?,"My brother and I are both in our 30s, and in somewhat related creative fields. I live in a high cost of living area, and have a remote job based in another high cost of living area. He lives in a small town with a significantly lower cost of living. His job is government funded at a local organization he likes. But he shared with me recently that he knows he's underpaid and that his current job has little room for growth, and he's discontented with both those things. 

I truly don't know that he understands just how underpaid he is! I make almost 3x more than him, with a comparable level of experience and education. I'm older by a few years and have a master's degree, but I also have made a couple of career pivots that make me more junior in my current path, so I think it evens out.

Anyway, I encouraged him to look at remote jobs based in high cost of living areas, since I think he would find ample options for interesting work that would better recognize his value. But I wonder if it would be pushy or boastful to put a finer point on it by sharing my actual salary? I'm two months into a new job, so have fresh job hunting perspective, and I really think he could do a lot better! WIBTA?

EDIT: Commenters have pointed out that I underestimated the difference between our potential pay. We are both in creative fields and have some overlapping skills, but our job titles do have different ranges, with mine averaging higher. This makes my salary a lot less relevant of a data point for him. However, he's still really undervalued at his current job!

With that info (thanks to those who did the research) I'm leaning towards sharing more general information about how switching jobs recently was beneficial to me and this is a good time to be looking. I'll share my pay if he asks or if it seems especially relevant in the conversation, but it's not helpful enough info to lead with by any means. Thanks for your perspectives!",Not the A-hole
AITA for not accepting already worn underwear?,"Context: Me (13f) and my mom (37f) are going on a trip to help my sister (18f) move in for college. While packing I said I didn't have much underwear, which my mom bitched at me for. 
Afterwards, we dug through my laundry and found underwear that certainly in the hell weren't mine. My mom said ""They don't fit me anymore so put these in your bag"" so I agreed.
I get it washers exist and all but I found it kinda disgusting bc I don't know when these underwear were washed last. They were sitting in my laundry for a long ass time.

This will probably be marked as ""not enough info"" but it's all I have at the moment. Anyways Reddit, am I overreacting and the asshole or not?",Not the A-hole
AITA for the wedding date I chose.,"Trying to keep my family from seeing this so please do not share this story on another medium; you do not have my permission (lookin at you Newsweek). Also on mobile so sorry for the formatting. And sorry for the length, I was trying to give enough info.

I(26F) recently got engaged to my fiancé(33M). I’m extremely indecisive so it’s taken us a few months to actually pick a wedding date. We chose our date by starting with the figuring out the month that would work for us and then looked at the weekend dates. Side note (important for context in the story) my fiancé is a math teacher and when we met I hit him with a couple math jokes, he laughed, and here we are about to get married.
The date we chose is essentially a math equation (Think March 19, 2022 (3+19=22)).
We thought it fit us and our nerdy brains well and are excited to finally have a date.

On to where I now feel like an asshole. I live a few states away from my family. I’m back visiting and was talking with my future SIL and she brought up that we stole her wedding weekend. Their wedding is this year (ours is next), but the day after ours. And she is pissed. 
I told her that it didn’t even cross my mind that their wedding date was so close we literally chose it for the math (kinda quirky I know) and she told me that makes it worse and I’m extremely selfish. 
They picked their date by going through all the weekends in the season she wanted and avoided any holiday, event, birthday, anniversary to avoid any conflicting date on her side of the family and my brothers side. She also wanted to go out of the country for their first anniversary and I ruined all that  by stealing her wedding weekend.

My mom says I’m not an AH (but she strongly dislikes my SIL so I take her opinion with a grain of sugar) and my fiancé says we can do whatever the heck we want. But my SIL is still so mad and I feel like a crappy person for not realizing the dates were so close. But we have already told so many of our friends and family our wedding date.

I’m going crazy trying to come up with a solution because I feel terrible that I didn’t think about their wedding date and how close it is to the one we chose. But, I also love the date we have because it fits us so well and my fiancés face lit up when he realized the math-y part of it.

Idk if this is important, but I know obviously there are lots of dates that end up working like a math problem. Our preferred month is because it’s my fiancés only free month in the summer (teaches and coaches the rest of the year) and it’s after my year long residency because I can’t really take time off for my wedding during the residency program.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my friend that she can't expect us to drop everything for her?,"I have a friend, ""Victoria"" (30F) who I love dearly but she has a quirk that I cannot stand. Victoria is notoriously indecisive. Sometimes it can be avoided, others not much.

&#x200B;

The last big point of contention was 5 years ago, when she got married. People took off work, booked flights, etc...all for her to change her mind just months before the wedding. Both times, there was no emergency or reason to change the date. She just found a better venue and it was still early enough to get deposits back on the original, so she did it. Of course, people were upset. And once again, a lot of people couldn't come to the new date. A few of us tried to tell her to manage her expectations. Victoria just kept saying it was her special day, she could do with it what she wanted. And what's worse is, two friends in our group supported this behavior.

&#x200B;

We've had some minor issues where we'll start planning group trips, only for her to back out or want to change everything. We never lose money, but it's still annoying. And still, we resolved this by basically planning everything and telling her where to show up.

&#x200B;

Cut to the next time that's not possible, this year. Victoria is pregnant with her first kid. She helped plan the shower and picked the venue (a friend's house), date, etc. This time we triple checked that this is what she wanted. She said yes. The shower is supposed to be in 2 weeks. Then...she changed her mind. She wanted to change the venue and the date. 

&#x200B;

Once again, several people can't come. And this time, I'm included. My husband and I have an anniversary trip planned. Non-refundable tickets and resort accommodations. We're also going to be somewhere that doesn't allow technology.

&#x200B;

Victoria asked me to reschedule and I said I can't, I'm sorry, but I'll send a gift. She got really upset and said she wanted me there. I sympathized but said I had this trip planned for over a year. She then mentioned how many other people can't come. I pointed out maybe it's a sign to keep the shower on the same date, same venue, etc. Especially as our friend is still willing to host. Victoria tried to pull the same old ""it's my special day, you only get one baby shower, etc"". I got fed up and told her that she is well within her rights to change the date, but that it is inconsiderate to constantly do this last minute. I pointed out while she's free to do what she wants, she has to stop getting mad at others for having lives and not dropping everything for her. Victoria began to cry and hung up.

Our friend group is divided. Some think I should've just let her be upset, she'd get over it in time. That it wasn't the place to bring up my issue with her indecisive nature. Others have told me that I did the right thing. So, AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA Told my boss I'm not required to answer my phone 24/7 and now he's salty,"I (37M) work in a department where I'm the sole expert for our equipment. If an issue comes up and the shift crew cant figure it out, I'm the first one they try to contact. I'm happy to help since I'm friends with all of our guys, but these calls can come at late night or early morning and my schedule is 7a-4p. When I go the job, the only stipulation was that they would be able to contact me for stuff like scheduling issues, shift coverage or other issues but it did not mention anything about after hours on-call. Outside of my normal hours, I dont give a rats ass about the plant. I’ll usually answer calls out of my own goodwill, as long as that’s not being abused. However my sleep time is sacred. If I’m woken up, it will take me at least an hour to fall back to sleep IF I’M LUCKY.

My phone started going off around 1am and went off a few times more before my wife gave me a swift kick in the ass telling me to shut it off or answer it. I call back and it's our shift technician (Clayton). He apologized for waking me up but they've been dealing with an issue for hours so I help him out and it took all of 5 minutes. After hanging up, I ended up lying there in bed for another 2 hours before falling back asleep. 

That morning, my supervisor (John) has me meet him in his office and this is how our conversation goes:

John: “It seems we had an eventful night, Clayton had to get ahold of me. You didn’t answer his call?”

Me: “Around 1am? I was asleep and the phone didn’t wake me.”

John: “Well he called me and I wasn’t able to do much for him so I had him call you back. Told him you were probably hard to wake up and to keep calling.”

Me, a little pissed off now: “Well I’m always happy to help the guys but they can’t rely on me to always be available. I usually keep my phone in the kitchen but I just happened to have left it on my nightstand last night.”

John: “Well this isn’t the first time they’ve had trouble reaching you.”

Me, a bit more agitated: “Most likely because my phone was in the kitchen, I don’t keep it on me 24/7.”

John: “You’re required to have a phone on you.”

Me, pissed off: “Ok, nowhere in the policy does it dictate that I am to keep on a phone on me at all times, nor does my job description. I am only required to have a method for you to contact me if we have a scheduling change or some other issues that deal directly with my ability to get to work. If you wish for me to be on call then perhaps we need to discuss promoting me to a position that requires me to be on call but I am happy with my current arrangement. If you feel differently then maybe we need to invite HR to join our conversation.” 

That's where things ended. I'm well aware that I could suffer some consequences for this but I feel that this is an overstep on their part. I do have a good working relationship with everyone but when he said that I pretty much snapped at him and now I'm feeling like an AH.

So AITA?

ETA:
Well this got way more of a response than I imagined. 

1. So I have been keeping notes and saving all communications over the years and have backups of all call logs and text transcripts. This was done ju as t to keep my ass covered by to now I see it'll come in use. I have a meeting with the head of HR tomorrow and my plan is to lay enough info to show a pattern of what's going on. 
2. On the recommendation of another redditor, I did send an email to my boss asking him to confirm that I'm ""expected to keep my phone on me at all times"" and he responded ""affirmative"". Well that's part of the info package. 
3. While they do not pay for my phone, there have been insinuations made by supervisors that since the company provides a corporate discount through the carrier I use that it justifies them asking us to be available. I dont even use this discount because we can't stack it with other discounts. I have a family plan and since my mother is on it, we get to use the discount that the county she works for provides and it's a better discount. 
Anyway I will provide an update once things shake out.  Thanks everyone!",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to get rid of my cat so he can keep his dog?,"My husband and I have 2 boys. I have a cat (6) and he has a dog (2). I've never been a dog person. I knew I had to get over my trauma eventually so after months of harping on me about getting a dog, I allowed it but it wasn't without protest. I actually adore some dogs (like my mom's girl who is hands down probably the best dog on this planet). But in most cases.. I truly just don't like them and it's not the dogs fault, but the owners and lack of training. So when I finally caved and 'let him' get a dog, I made it very clear that he was to train the dog and that I would not be responsible. He got the dog two years ago and she is a terror. 100% my husband's doing. It's not even her fault. 

So.. she still gets in the garbage. Still has accidents inside. Her anxiety is to a point of her whining nonstop and constantly underfoot. She barks and whines whenever she is in the vehicle (and he insists on bringing her everywhere). She's reactive. She's food driven to a point of excessively sniffing the floors for hours on end and never stops until she tires herself out. She stares at you whining whenever you have food. I was just able to get her to stop nipping faces (her idea of ""playing and showing affection"" if you go based off what my husband claims). He is the problem. But it admittedly has made me feel like I'm held captive in my own home. My kids also don't want this dog and never have. But again, it's because of my husband. 

Well, we found a rent to own that my husband desperately wants. He fell madly in love with it. We have honestly been searching for awhile but they've made it clear that only one pet is allowed. My immediate reaction was ""well this won't work"", whereas his reaction was ""Who can we get to take the cat"". I told him I wasn't willing to get rid of my cat so he can keep his untrained dog that no one wants but him. He thinks I'm an AH because I ""don't have the same bond with the cat that he does with the dog"". I can see his point, as he has an unhealthy obsession with his dog and she is the exact same way with him. But I still won't do it. He says this may be the only chance we have for awhile to get in to a home (which also could be true). But I still stood firm. He won't speak to me and has been snuggling his dog nonstop for 4 days straight. AITA?

ETA: I posted this to another commenter asking for info: I've literally talked till I'm blue in the face about getting her in to training (behavioral especially due to her being reactive and resource guarding). He outright refuses. He says it's a waste of money to pay someone that much money when ""we"" could just do it ourselves. He won't get her medicated for her anxiety outside of THC chews, which simply do not work.

I personally have tried training her on several occasions despite the original agreement being that it wouldn't be my responsibility. For awhile I actually thought I was making headway because all I had to do was snap my fingers at her whenever she was doing something she shouldn't (like getting in the trash) and she would immediately listen to me. However, I'm honestly not sure what happened because despite me still continuing to do everything I was before and being consistent, she no longer listens at all. Like she will stare at me while I snap my fingers to get away from the trash can and continue to do so until I physically get up and walk toward her; which at that point she runs and hides in her kennel growling while staring up at me. Basically she does not see me as an ""alpha"" (I have a dog trainer friend who has helped understand a little bit). She does not respect me or my position in the household and due to this she has stopped listening to me fully. However, now whenever I speak up to the dog my husband immediately gets pissed off and says I'm being too mean. Like I said, he is definitely the problem. He isn't consistent. He doesn't follow the same training I did and I think that's why it came undone. He lets her get away with much more than he should. Ex: she can be outside for 45 minutes, come indoors and shit and he immediately blames himself and says ""aww baby, did I not keep you outside long enough? I will do better next time."" Or if she gets in the garbage he will insist it's because she's ""obviously hungry and missing something in her diet"".",Not the A-hole
AITA for laughing at my fiance's response to our disagreement on dishwasher loading,"Edit 2: He came home from work the day I made this post feeling very embarrassed with himself. He admitted my laugh had triggered him into unloading his bad day onto me, but that was in no way the right thing to do. He's been on his best behavior ever since, and came to the table with a full plan on how to mend things and not let them get to this point again. This includes redistributing all chores around the house. And yes, he's now solely responsible for dishes lol

He's apologized at random about 100 times in the last day and a half so I think he feels worse about things than I do. 

I want to thank everyone who took the time to read and comment on this post. I really appreciate the feedback you all gave. This will probably be the last update now that this the issue is resolved. 





Edit: Holy cow. I did not expect to get this much reaction. Some more info I saw people wondering about:

-we both work full time, but im 100% remote and at home so I honestly don't mind taking on more in terms of laundry and cooking. It really is only the dishes we bicker about most times. I promise. 

-he does laundry for the both of us, I just usually already have it done. He more often is the one to put it all away. I do wish he would just do the dang dishes tho. 

-we do have an intensely landscaped yard and try to grow as much of our own food as we can so he does spend a lot of 
time out there.

-ill try to respond to as many comments as I can!




Original Post:
Some background: Me (F 32) and my fiancé (M 38) have been together for 6 years, engaged very recently. The relationship is great overall, but we disagree sometimes on division of household chores.

Last night, I was loading the dishwasher while listening to him talk about his day (bad day). When he went quiet, I looked up to find him staring with his arms crossed. I knew it was because he didn't like how I was loading the dishwasher. He has very strong opinions on how dishes should be done. 

I laughed and said ""what? What did I do incorrectly?"" And he pointed out what he thinks I did wrong. ""Those 2 dishes are touching."" ""That dish should be here"" ""that dish wasn't rinsed enough before you put it in"" 

I nodded, and said ""well, you could take over doing the dishes if you want them done a certain way"" 

Context: he's currently in charge of yardwork and taking out the garbage. I do pretty much everything else around the house. 

He huffed and said ""so when I come to you to solve this problem, you're response is just to suggest *I* do it?"" 

I couldn't help it. I laughed. Yes, that is exactly what I am suggesting my guy. He didn't like that and promptly went to bed. I figured he was just worked up because he had a long day, but when he got up the next morning and went straight to work without saying bye to me like he normally does, it makes me wonder if I was being insensitive??",Not the A-hole
AITA for calling my friends mom to get her daughter to clean her mess after she defecated in my bed and just left without telling me?,"A little context, the only reason I’m friends with her is because I’m friends with her friends. Anyways we all planned on sleeping over my house, just because. I wasn’t even going to invite said friend let’s call anne because she’s low key kinda weird, but I know if I didn’t she’d bitch and moan that she wasn’t invited etc. I’d rather keep my sanity so I invited her. Big mistake

Everything was good for the most part, until the morning after. Lemme set the scene, anne woke me up kinda in a rush to leave apparently she had Field hockey practice and her mom was picking her up. I was half asleep so I’m just like cool lock the door on your way out. At this point I was gonna go back to sleep until I get a whiff of I kid you not the raunchiest
smell. At first I assumed it was my dog, she’s still potty training so I wouldn’t be surprised if it was her.

So I get up grab a bag and a paper towel and start searching around my room for what I thought was dog crap. Update it wasn’t dog crap, it was diarrhea where she had been sleeping. The worst part is my friends and I were looking for a almost 5 minutes trying to find this turd but, instead we found literal human shit.

At this point we were all gagging, so I go to my bathroom to grab some air freshener. Where I find her turd infested drawls in my garbage can. She didn’t even try hiding them under stuff just left it at the top. After I was done spraying a half a bottle of air freshener around my room. I was like no way in hell am I cleaning this up. So I called her mom, basically giving her a rundown of the entire situation. 

Her mom then drove back to my house and and kept apologizing while helping us clean everything. (Love her mom) she even gave me 50$ for new sheets. My mom thinks I was a douche for this, and anne was probably embarrassed enough after the whole situation. An if I would’ve asked she would’ve cleaned it up. My friends say they would’ve done the same thing and I didn’t do anything wrong. That honestly got me thinking though if I was really the asshole here so AITA?

AITA for leaving my stepfather behind in our family vacation?,"I’m (24F) currently on a trip with my mother, brother and stepfather.

To shorten the story I’ll go straight to the point. Yesterday we decided to leave our Airbnb around 8AM cause we were taking public transportation to save some money and also had a guide visit at 9:30AM at the Edinburgh castle and according to google maps it would take us around 45 min to get there. Everybody got ready in time, except my stepfather Daniel (M46) who couldn’t decided what jacket to wear… that already made us a couple minutes late but wouldn’t miss the bus. He then picked out a very big and heavy red jacket, we all asked him multiple times if he was sure because the jacket was a lot even to carry around all day. But he was certain. 

INFO: The walking distance from the Airbnb to the bus stop was 10 min, we left the house around 8:10AM and the bus was supposed to arrive at 8:25AM. 

As soon as we arrived at the bus stop Daniel decided that we were right and the red jacket was too much then went back to change which made us to miss the first bus. My brother and I got a little annoyed but mom said we had time. Daniel took 15 min to return then he said that he was going back because the jacket he picked now wasn’t warm enough. That made us miss the second bus. He came back wearing the exact same jacket because he didn’t got to change it cause he got lost and couldn’t find the house (it’s a suburban area and the houses looks very similar). At this point, we all were very irritated but he went back anyway. The 3rd bus was arriving and my brother and I decided to take it. Mom didn’t like it and asked us to wait. We agreed for her which guess what? We missed the 3rd bus. Now there was a chance of us being late because was around 8:45AM at this point. Daniel returned and everything seemed fine, we waited for the bus and as it got there and Daniel tried to find his phone but couldn’t… he forgot it at home. My brother and I had enough and wouldn’t miss this bus. We went ahead and said that we would be meeting them at the castle. They arrived at 10AM and couldn’t join the guided tour but we did lol… Daniel was upset and said that we had the whole day to visit the castle and wouldn’t make a difference at what time we arrived there. Mom supported us but said she talked with Daniel and he’ll apologize if we do the same but I feel like we didn’t do anything wrong but according to him we were kind of a**hole. I don’t want to drag this and ruin the vacation… what do you guys think?

INFO 2: Some people commented that he might have a mental issue. The answer is no. Daniel is completely fine, he actually have a brother with mental disability and when their mother died (about a year ago) Daniel took guardianship of him and had to take a few tests ordered by a judge to make sure he is able.

UPDATE: Thank you all who gave advices, my mother approached us, said she realized we didn’t do anything wrong and apologized… turns out that this wasn’t the first time something like this happen. Won’t go into much detail about what our mom told us but Daniel is absolutely terrible at time management and is used to people bending to his will… we’ve dealt differently and he wasn’t expecting that. She sat us down and told him that 1) she already raised her kids and don’t want to raise a husband. 2) We wouldn’t be apologizing because we didn’t do anything wrong unlike him who was disrespectful to our family. 3) if we establish a time and he couldn’t be there we’ll be leaving without him.

AITA for leaving my husband for a Christmas trip to Hawaii with our kids,"Every year my family spends our Christmas in Hawaii. We’ve done it every year since I can remember and it’s a fun family tradition for me. After me and my husband had kids we had to reorganize our family Christmas plans because his parents wanted to see our kids for Christmas, so we decided that we would celebrate Christmas with his parents on New Years and go to Hawaii for actual Christmas.

This is the system that worked for us until last year. Last year his dad passed away around this time of the year and it hit him and his mom hard. For obvious reasons we didn’t go to Hawaii.

This year we planned out what we’d do for the holidays early. We’d do Thanksgiving with his mom, and we’d do Christmas in Hawaii since me and the kids missed out last year. Things were going well until right before our flight. About a week out, he said he was unsure. He said that he thinks it might be better that we stay. He said he really wanted to spend Christmas with his family and felt like his mom really needed it.

I was unhappy about this, we made a plan, we saw her last month, and we already had my dad buy our tickets and hotel, so it would be incredibly unfair to me, him and our kids for us to not go just for his mom, who we’d see a few days after we got back anyways.

We got into an argument about it and proposed that me and the kids can go to Hawaii and he can stay there with his mom. He decided to do this but he was very clearly upset that I wasn’t going to forgo my family’s Christmas tradition and seeing my family just for his mom.

So now I’m in Hawaii watching and rangling the kids by myself. While he’s home alone. He have said texted me or responded to me much. When I call him he only talks for about 3 minutes before wanting to get off the phone with me and talk to the girls.

AITA for not reheating the dish?,"Hi everyone! I apologize in advance for my poor english.

I (26F) have been with my boyfriend (32M) for 5 years.

He works longer hours than me, so he usually is home at 8:30-9PM.
Yesterday I was working from home. I had a really rough day due to an endometriosis crisis (at some point I couldn't stand up). I try not to take medecine everyday because they are strong morphinic painkillers.

I finished working at 5, and then went to get some groceries, put the laundry in the machine and cooked the dinner. As my boyfriend wasn't home, I put his dish into the fridge and ate mine.

When he got home, he was kinda grumpy. I was in bed because I was again hurting a lot. He told me to bring him water and his meal. I reply I couldn't because of the cramps. He told me :""fine, then I won't eat and I will be thirsty, I have a stomachache too you know"".

I told him to get the dish from the fridge and just reheat it, but he wouldn't and just said :""Ok so when I ask for water and some food, I just can't get it, understood."" Then he told me he will not come back next week because I treated him poorly (he owns an appartment).

I think I could have take a medecine and just suck it up for peace. AITA?",Not the A-hole
"AITA for making a ""teacher"" feel like a POS?","I have a 7yo son who started exhibiting a lot of negative behaviors at school roughly a year ago. He's had tons of specialists evaluate him through the school system. He's fine when he is home and I truly don't have many issues with him here but at school it's totally different. Running away, refusing to stay inside classrooms, hiding, yelling, etc. We finally got him an IEP and things started looking up. The specialists came to the conclusion that he has severe anxiety and PTSD. 

Now.. this was a bitter pill to swallow as a parent. I left his father when he was only 3 years old due to some not so friendly behaviors that happened in front of my child. There's a no contact order, his rights have been terminated and he's been charged. It was only happening to me but my son saw it. I was stupid enough to believe that he wouldn't remember (I don't remember any of my childhood so it was an assumption based off personal experience). Well he obviously remembers and the specialists have stated that the amount of chaos within the school is very triggering for him and they have limited his contact with heavily socialized environments due to this. He stays in a special classroom. He was doing great until today, when they tried getting him to go to music class and something triggered him. I ended up being called to come in and help. 

When I got there, this teacher that I had never met was sitting with my son. As soon as he saw me he ran towards me crying and this teacher started yelling at him! Told him to sit down and start listening for once, proceeded to very loudly tell me he was being rotten all day and continued to tell him to sit down and listen whenever he tried hugging me. I lost my shit entirely. I had my son go in to the office to see one of his favorite peers and I let this bitch have it, telling her she must be the worst kind of  human to think that her behavior was in any way appropriate and that she had better stay far away from my son or I will make sure she doesn't have a job in the near future. When I left she was crying and now I feel terrible.

ETA: adding some info that others have mentioned: this ""teacher"" was the substitute for the IEP classroom. She went against his IEP care plan and tried forcing him to go to music class with 20+ other students versus go by his care plan, which clearly states he is to be put in groups of 2-3 other kiddos with IEPs for all his studies. The IEP has been in affect for over a month and this is the first time he's had an episode since being in the program and could have been avoided had she cared to take 2 seconds to read his individual care plan. I was also told by the principal (whom I called and reported this to) that this teacher had been briefed on my son's situation so she was fully aware how triggering even raising her voice to him was. She didn't care, obviously, or she wouldn't have been yelling at him to begin with. And yes, she actually did call him rotten. So not only was her voice raised through the entire altercation as my kid was crying but she was also not letting him hug me and calling him names. He's in therapy.",Not the A-hole
AITA for wanting to become a vegetarian when my spouse is a meat-eater and we're in the middle of many changes in our lives?,"Every since I (35F) was young, I've always been a very picky eater when it comes to meat: it always had to be well-done, without fatty stuff, no excessive grease, no bones/cartilage/nerves/whatever or I would stop eating the thing altogether. So it's no wonder I would try to become a vegetarian several times in my life... in the first, um, 10 times I was living with my parents and without any support (as well as not enough info on the matter) I would have to switch back to meat again.  
I've now been with my husband (34M) for almost 10 years, and, except for the beginning of our relationship, I've never quite been the person to cook meat in the kitchen (and even if I did, it would have to be a steak he would manipulate the cut for me or I would try to do so, but avoiding touching it as much as possible). I've also started only recently to love myself for who I am, as I'm in therapy and meds for quite some time and recovering from a 20+ year depressive state. I must also mention my husband is neurodivergent (extremely high IQ, excessively logic, inside the ASD).  
Feeling more comfortable in my skin has also made me motivated to become a vegetarian once and for all, and I communicated my decision to my husband a couple of weeks ago. By explaining how I FEEL about meat made my husband, at first, not argue with it, as he can't argue with feelings; however, as days went by, he became more and more verbal on how illogical it is to not eat something without having any food intolerance or allergy related to it; how veganism is like a ""cult""; how I can damage my health to the point I will suffer miscarriages (we want to try and have kids soon); how that will RUIN social gatherings and bother everyone; how the environmental and animal welfare talk is bs; etc. Basically for every time we have met and stayed in the same room for over 3 minutes he starts a whooooole TED talk on it.  
The thing is, this is not the first time he hasn't agreed with my choices and tastes, and while I understand he may fear for my health and safety, I'm pretty sure it won't matter if I show him medical results or any data whatsoever. We are in the middle of many changes regarding our home, career paths and preparing to have children, and I know that adding my vegetarianism is just another extra point to deal with, but I feel it is the right time for me. Am I really THAT wrong and selfish?",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my wife I don’t want her to take my son to girls lunches where they drink?,"
My wife (29) went to lunch with her sister in law, her sister in laws mom, and my sister in law. Before she was pregnant they would have these “girls lunches” every other week and usually would drink enough to be fairly tipsy to outright drunk. Our baby is one month, this is her first time having more than a few sips of alcohol after giving birth. 

When she got home I could smell the alcohol on her breath. She said she only had two drinks over the course of 3 hours and I left it alone for a little while. Once she started talking to me though it seemed as if she had more. So I asked her if she had more than two, she said “two and a half to three”. I told her I’m not comfortable with her taking our son to these lunches when they are going to drink. Our sisters can be a bit pushy when it comes to drinking so I’m still not convinced it was only three drinks. 

She got really upset with me and said I’m acting like she’s some kind of drunk and that I don’t feel that our son is safe with her. I told her that’s not the case and I just don’t want him being driven by someone who’s had any drinks. I said this was the first time she’s drank since giving birth and she probably should’ve only had one.  She’s pissed at me and I think it’s completely unreasonable. 

Am I the asshole?


Edit : Thanks for the comments everyone. Just for the record I would have kept him home with me but considering it was the first girls lunch in a while I wanted our families to see him and as I’ve said in it other comments, I only expected her to have one drink. I’ll take responsibility for that I shouldn’t have expected anything and laid out what I expected. I’m going to simmer down and speak to her about it tomorrow. I’m still seething because even 2 hours after she got back home I can still smell the alcohol on her breath.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I hid my pads from my sisters because they won’t buy their own pads?,"I (22F) have two sisters who are 19 and 14. I have bought pads that were only enough for me to last for two periods. My sisters constantly ask me for pads and I noticed that they took more than necessary, leaving me with 4 pads by the time my next period arrives. I wouldn’t notice my pads being low so fast until after my next period is near. I have told my sisters several times that they needed to get their own pads and I would only expect them to ask me for pads if they ran out of their own. They would also become very invasive and enter my room when I’m not there (locking my door won’t work, they manage to get in anyways) in order to get pads and they’ll search through every drawer and every nook and cranny to get a pad. I have confronted them of this and they denied it. Another thing they’ll knock on my door very very loud at the worst times, late at night and even early in the morning to ask for a pad. My sister knocked on my door very very loud at 1 AM and asked for a pad. I was very angry by this and threw 4 pads at her so she won’t bother me the next day about it and told her to not knock on my door again. 


I am now considering hiding my pads and just refuse to give them any until they buy their own pads in order to get the point across and hopefully they’ll get their own pads and not ask me for mine. My mother had done the same for me and I learned to get my own pads. They can get expensive and sharing them makes it super difficult as I cannot afford to buy pads for two other girls. I can only buy pads for myself as they can get pricy which sucks as there’s a lot of women and girls out their who cannot get access to pads or tampons, creating an impact on day to day life. Pads should be free! 


Would I be the asshole if I hid my pads from my sisters since they have made no effort to buy their own pads?


Edit: WOW! I wasn’t expecting this to blow up! I’ll try my hardest to reply to everyone’s comments. I’m also using mobile (my dumb self forgot my Reddit password lol) so it’s hard to reply sometimes from your phone. I’ll keep ya’ll updated and I’ll respond as much as I can!


Edit 2: a lot of ya’ll showed concerned when I mentioned “my mother had done the same for me and I learned to get my own pads”, to clear things up, my mom had ALWAYS provided me with pads but she wanted me to have my own set as sharing can get pads to run out quickly. My mother only hid the pads ONLY ONCE because I kept taking hers instead of asking her to buy me pads, at the time that she did hide them, I already had a couple pads left so I wasn’t “pad-less”. After that, I started asking her to buy pads. The thing about my mom is that she thinks we all have pads and won’t think we would run out unless we TOLD HER. My mom would have no clue if me or my sisters ran out of pads unless we told her, otherwise she would assume we had enough. It wasn’t like she would go in our rooms to check if we have enough pads lol. 

Another thing to mention is that my 19 year old sister has the money to buy pads but she blows it on food and other things, which is a huge problem to me. What has angered me the most was that she had made ZERO effort to buy pads on her own, I checked my 14 year old sisters room and she had pads of her own so she did not bother me about it but has asked before since she didn’t have any so I gave her some. The main issue is my 19 year old sister using my pads, especially. I cannot always afford to provide pads for two people and they run out really quick.


Edit 2: a lot of you have been expressing concern for my 14 year old sister, she has pads of her own now and this month she had not asked me for any. She would only ask when she didn’t have any and her and my other sister kept taking lots and lots of pads, leaving me with 4 pads left. My sister got her own pads as she realized that it wasn’t fair for me to buy pads that were meant for only myself only for it to be almost gone in a month. So again, my 14 year old sister has HER OWN PADS. I’m sorry, I posted this late at night and I was very frustrated as I was typing, leaving a lot of information in the process. The biggest issue is my 19 year old sister, she is mostly the one who takes my pads and does so at horrible hours of the night and in the morning asking me for pads. I gave her 4 pads last night for her to just be a big girl and buy her own pads. I’m gonna talk to her today about this issue. 

Also, I would like to thank everyone who had expressed concern for myself and my sisters. I can assure you that we were NOT abused nor neglected when it came to feminine hygiene. If we told our mothers we need pads, she will get it for us. My sisters did ask but they just stopped because they thought it was ok to use my pads when it wasn’t, and I have told them several times to get their own.


Update 1: I spoke to my 14 year old sister and I asked her why she she didn’t get pads of her own until recently, she said that it was because SHE NEVER ASKED. When I asked why she never asked for pads as it was such a necessity, she said she just simply never asked and didn’t see why she would. I told her that from now on, she needs to start asking me if she is ever low on pads and that I cannot read minds. I also told her that I cannot afford to have 3 girls share pads that are meant for one person but I can afford to buy pads for one person (weird concept, I know). So the main problem comes from the fact that my sisters never asked. I will be providing my 14 year old sister with pads from now on and will be considering buying a big box of pads for even the 3 of us to share. 


The biggest problem now is my 19 year old sister who HAS THE MONEY to buy pads but just simply refuses to. So I have hid the pads away from my 19 year old sister so she can buy her own, I want her to learn her lesson the hard way. She has been doing this for far too long and I have had enough. Also, thank you for the suggestions of using reusable pads, I’m going to be looking into this. I will be posting an update in a few days or even a month from now so I will not be editing any more posts and I will not be responding to more comments as it’s a lot! But I will continue to read them and accepting any form of judgement. I apologize if my post was confusing or if there wasn’t enough info, I promise to clear up all your confusions in a new update post in the near future. Thank you to everyone who has commented! I appreciate everyone’s suggestions and also concerns.


Another update: I read most of the comments and a lot of people are wondering if my sister has access to food and other basic necessities, yes, she does! As mentioned before, and even in the comments, my 14 year old sister has her own pads. I didn’t even think to include that before making this post.",Not enough info
AITA for reporting the guy at my gym?,"I (20F) went to the gym earlier today. This gym is a very small gym where everyone knows each other and those who go there usually work for the county or amateur boxer but also some others like me who my dad got me started there. I am pretty much the only consistent girl there. There’s been this one guy (early 60s who we’ll call Dan) who has made me uncomfortable a few times before but always gave him the benefit of the doubt. 

Today I was doing the leg press when he came over and had a chat with me about the weights I loaded on. At the end of the chat, he said doing it was good for “tightening my fanny”. I quickly became very upset and hurried up my workout but he soon left. 

When I was getting close to leaving, one of the coaches (Ray) I am good friends with, showed up. I pulled him aside in private so his fighter wouldn’t hear and asked for advice. I said I didn’t want to cause drama. He said he would make a few phone calls and reassured me. 

Later that day, my dad called me and said that one of the guys (Jim) called him and asked for me to talk to him. Jim apparently told him that Dan said he wasn’t trying to be sexual. I haven’t had the courage to reach out to Jim. I feel stupid and embarrassed. Am I the asshole for reporting the guy from my gym?

Edit: posted some more info in comments and also that Jim helps manage the gym (https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1221ez2/aita_for_reporting_the_guy_at_my_gym/jdod25a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3)

AITA for installing a new lock on my bedroom door and locking it every time I leave?,"I didn't think I'd ever feel the need to post on AITA but here goes.

I (24F) have a step dad (50's M) of around 14 years. We were in good terms at first but grew distant in my early teens because of many reasons including the horrible friction between me and his kids. He was also inappropriate (can't reveal the details or this post will get deleted). Eventually, he kicked me out five months before I turned 16. At least I was in a boarding school. 

I never would have come back to this house if I had a choice. But my mum is horribly unwell and needs help doing most things. She had to stop working and so she cannot afford a nurse. Also, SD stopped paying all bills at around the same time he kicked me out so he obviously can't pay for her nurse or medication. I decided to move back in temporarily because 1. I'm my mum's only family in this city and really, the only one with a flexible schedule. 2. SD works overseas and only comes home quarterly. We wouldn't necessarily have to meet much. His kids moved out ages ago too. Plus this is not just his house. They bought it together when they got married so I think mum deserves to have someone taking care of her even if that person is not SD's favorite person. 

The problem is, he keeps some of his stuff in my childhood bedroom. Things like old chargers, shoes he doesn't wear often, empty suitcases and car stuff. So mum's procedure is taking longer than expected. SD came back for his quarterly break on 20th and boy has it been a madhouse. 

On his first day in I went grocery shopping and came back to a ransacked bedroom. He flipped everything around including my beddings and clothes and stole my diary and bedroom key. When I say I have never felt less comfortable than when I had to sleep in a bedroom I couldn't lock under the same roof as him... 

As soon as I got my paycheck, I had a new lock installed and sent all the extra keys back to my house. The only remaining key stays with me at all times. When I leave my room even to go to cook, I lock it and keep the key with me. SD realized this and is furious. He blew up on me and told me this is his house and he gets to set the rules and I should take my ""privacy propaganda"" back to my house. 

I didn't think I was TA until I talked to my friend and she agreed that it's his house so he gets to keep his stuff in whatever room he wants and be able to retrieve them whenever he wants. My mum thinks I did the right thing but really, she would think I'm right regardless of the situation so I don't think her opinion truly counts. So AITA? 

Additional info: I can work from wherever there's a stable Internet connection. My place is too far to move back and forth every day and although I make what most people would consider a lot, I have a pile up of student loans and my own mortgage and bills and whatever is left is not enough to hire a nurse/helper for her.

WIBTAH for starting to do the same hobby as my brother?,"I am new to reddit so if I do something wrong or didn't provide enough info, u know why :)

Little context first:
My (19m) brother(22m) has a twitchchannel where he streams irregularly for about 4-6 hours a week. My brother streams games and doesnt really have any other hobbies besides meeting with friends(sometimes). His twitchchannel is not really big and usually he has the same 6 viewers and 75% are friends. Although this is the case, he really enjoys it and I think it is the best hobby he ever had and he thinks that aswell. He does have a job, but he does that behind the desk at home aswell so he basically is behind his computer the whole day(which is totally fine imo).

My problem:
I have always enjoyed the Youtube platform alot and I watch alot of it in my spare time. I also really like videogames but havent been really that active the last few years cuz I was busy with other stuf. Nevertheless I really enjoy playing games and I have been wanting to boost my gaminghobby again(I used to play videogames everyday until i started college 2 years ago). I always have been a bit more social then my brother, played sports which he didn't like that much, am volunteering at my sportsclub to do all sorts of stuff and have more interests.

Besides this I thought it would be a really fun idea to start my own Youtube channel and make gamingvideos. I have a bit of experience in graphic designing and editing and I have been really excited about this idea for like 2 weeks now(been wanting to do it for 2 years but now I started looking in to it in detail). The thing is that im a bit in a twist on if I should start doing it or not. On one hand I want to try it and I think it would be alot of fun as a side project and a way for me to restart my gaminghobby. On the other hand I am worried he or others in my family would say I am taking 'my brothers thing' for my own. And because I allready have more interests I can imagine it would not be fun for my brother if I started doing his hobby aswell.

Tldr: would I be the asshole for starting a youtubechannel and 'taking my brothers hobby', while my brothers only real hobby is to stream on twitch?",Not the A-hole
AITA for sneaking cookies in the house?,"So my Nana (grandma) loves spoiling me with soda and sweets. My favorite Soda ever is Coca Cola. (Screw you pepsi lovers!) My parents despise how my Nana spoils me, and she gave me around 5 cookies to take home. Harmless, right?

So I went home, excited to go watch some Redditor on YouTube, (sexiest man ever, been watching him since around late 2018.) and my dad noticed my cookies, and he freaks the hell out! He grabbed the cookies and started to go off on how my Nana always spoils me, and that he has, “held his tongue for TOO LONG!” 

I get pissed off as they were a nice treat for a long day at school from my Nana, after a bit of arguing, he left the house for a few hours to cool down.

AITA for not giving my children's father a portion of my stimulus check money?,"So I just got my $4,200 stimulus check (for me and my 2 kids). My ex-husband also received his $1,400 stimulus check, but has called me to ask if I would give him a cut of mine, since it was money I was receiving for *our* children. Not to mention, due to covid he has fallen on hard times, but I am not struggling.

I told him no because I don't feel he deserves it... now hear me out. The court ordered $251 a month in child support when we got divorced. I asked for the lowest possible amount only because I knew that he didn't make that much and I make significantly more than him. Right after the divorce was finalized, my mom and I told him that if he was struggling, not to stress about the payments because the girls would always be taken care of BUT that he was not absolved of his responsibilities. Obviously, we should not have been so easy on him because he barely made a single payment for 2 years, just some extra cash here and there. Then recently, he bought a brand new 2021 SUV and that was a huge slap in the face so we got tougher with the payments and now he's been paying the $251 a month for the last 6 months.

When I gently explained all this to him, he got defensive because ""It's not really *my* money, it's the governments money for *our* kids"" and that he should be entitled to some of it. Then starts to threaten having to go back to court for half custody so that he would get ""what he's entitled to"". So I mentioned to him that he does in fact have half custody, everything was split completely down the middle, including health insurance, school and extracurricular activities (which he does not pay for either because he feels the kids ""shouldn't need to go to an expensive school and have all these extra activities when he doesn't have the money for them in the first place""). I considered that a fair point since my mom and I do have them involved in a lot of pricey activities, but we have never minded covering that so that was never thrown in his face, and I also should add that he does not pay for half their insurance or medical bills, but he feels that because my family and I are more well off than him, that I should be giving him part of my stimulus check.

When I asked him what he needed it for, he said to just to have on hand in case he needs it. This is where I don't know if I'm being too controlling, but I told him (today and many times before) that if he is ever struggling, I will gladly help him. If he's short on groceries, or needs to go to the doctor, etc, I have no problem helping him. But he doesn't want *that* help, he just wants some of my stimulus money to have on hand and then accused me of being controlling because ""I only want to help him in the ways that I want to help, not how he wants it"". 

So AITA? My head is spinning from all this bullshit lol

Edit: Just wanted to clear up a few questions.
Some if you asked why he has to pay child support if the custody is 50/50 and if I make more than him. I actually asked our attorney (we shared one because we weren’t fighting over anything at the time) that same question and his response was that he’s familiar with the judge assigned to our case and she will not finalize the divorce unless someone is paying child support and since I am the primary guardian, meaning the kids primary residence is with me, their dad was the one to have to pay, which is why I asked for the bare minimum and cut him a break cause I figured as long as he had them 3 nights a week like he was supposed to, I wouldn’t have cared as much about the $251 a month. But he doesn’t take them that much and never overnight. 
As far as the 50/50 custody, that just means we are both are responsible for the decision making regarding their education and medical stuff. And technically he is supposed to be splitting all of that with me too, but he doesn’t do that either. 

Believe me, I am empathic of his situation considering I make more and it’s been rough on him the last few years mentally, but I feel like he’s just taking advantage now and enough’s enough

INFO: before purchasing the brand new car, he was actually given a truck by my grandmother, she puts a couple thousand into it fixing it up for him.... about a month later he decided it wasn’t for him, sold the truck and kept the money. So he got $1500 for that, plus he got a stimulus check of his own AND he’s receiving unemployment

Edit 2: also just want to reiterate that I have offered to pay for his dental work and new glasses that he needs but he declined that because he just wants “a cut of what should be his”",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to help my sister after her divorce?,"So, this might be a bit of a long post, because of the amount of background info I might have to share.

I(36F) have an older sister (38F). We don’t live in the US nor in any western country. We come from a dual income household, with both parents being high earners by middle class standards.

We used to be best friends when we were younger, but things started to turn bad when we were both in college. We both attended the same engineering college, just one year apart.

While I was busting my ass to get top marks, my sister was “shopping for a rich husband”. She would take all the money our parents sent her, spend it on clothes and makeup, then beg me to lend her some of my allowance so she can afford necessities. I used to do that at first, but then I cut her off when I got fed up. That was the first crack.

The second crack came when she did not pass her classes, so she ended up having to repeat her second year (second out of five), then we were in the same class. Because we had the same major, we had the exact same schedule. Then professors started comparing us (I was usually first or second in class, she was near the bottom, and had a habit of skipping class).

The final crack came when she got a rich BF, while I was dating a fellow classmate from a very poor background. She was constantly condescending, telling me how I will end up spending all my money on him and his poor family, and that I should follow her example and get a rich husband.

Our last year, she chose to drop out of school and marry her rich husband. They had a very grand wedding, and the bridal gifts he gave her included a BMW and enough gold to buy a small apartment.

I married my husband after we graduated and worked for a year. We had a small wedding (80 people), and my bridal gifts were modest (about what he made in a month). She started ridiculing him in front of his and our family, so my mom ended up kicking her out of the wedding.  

Fast forward to now, I have a 10 years old son that goes to a private school, my husband and I own our house, we bought his parents an apartment, and we go on a vacation abroad twice a year… all to say we are living well.

My sister’s husband divorced her because he “fell in love” with a 20 something young woman. And because all his wealth actually belongs to his parents, she came out with a measly sum in child support, a lot of jewellery and brand name clothes and her car. If she had been good with money, it would have been enough to start her own business. But she spent it all away, and now she is asking me for help in the form of lending her money to start a small business.

I told her absolutely not, she tried to push, I blocked her everywhere and she can’t get access to my job or to the gated community where we live.

She is currently living with our parents, along with her 3 kids, and from what my mom is saying, they are also getting fed up with her, but also she is apparently having a really hard time. So AITA?",Not the A-hole
"AITA for ""telling"" my best friend who she can and can't date?","I (16F) have a best friend (16F) and a cousin (17M). Me and my friend are pretty close and we've known each other since we were kids but we also have rules, one of them being to never date each others family members. I'd go into depth about what happened but I want to make this as straight to the point as possible.  


Shes always been a very flirty person and I don't mean that lightly, she easily moves on from one person to the next very easily and sometimes will date someone while secretly seeing or lusting after another person. Recently I found out she has a thing for my cousin, he's at my house often and since she visits a lot, they do interact sometimes. Although we had the rule, I thought nothing of it since she confessed it jokingly until my cousin told me she gave him her number 5 weeks ago, this is where it starts to get weird.   


Every time I'm out with the both of them, me and him could be talking about something or having an inside joke which she knows nothing about but will butt in unannounced and it started to annoy me. I thought I might've been a little rude for thinking that but he told me himself that it's weird how often she calls or make plans with the 3 of us but I end up being the 3rd wheel. Mind you...he has a girlfriend, she knows this. I can't even compliment her brother without her giving me THAT look.  


I brought this up to her being as patient as I could because I didn't want it to look like I was mad at her. But it backfired because she started going on about how she ""loves"" him (wayyy too soon when they're not even datingjhbdfhbjfd) and that I don't trust her, she then went on to say that I can't tell her who she should and shouldn't date.  


AITA?

edit: I never once flat out told her she couldn't date him, unless I didn't put enough info, she did this behind my back while I still have to keep her boundaries after she broke mine. I would've never brought this up to her if my cousin didn't mention it either, just thought I had to clarify.  Hope this didn't sound rude",Not the A-hole
AITAH for not forgiving my MIL for not being happy I’m pregnant?,"This happened a few month ago. My husband and I have been trying to have a baby. We finally got pregnant and we’re so excited. We had planned to tell my parents and his family on thanksgiving since my parents live far away and would be in town. His parents are divorced and don’t get along and we would be telling his father separately. 
Unfortunately my dad broke his ankle and had surgery a few days before thanksgiving so my parents couldn’t make it. My husband and I decided to just do thanksgiving with his family.
The first thing that happened was his mom trying to force alcohol down my throat as soon as I walked in the door. I pushed it off with a laugh that I hadn’t eaten all day and might have one with dinner. She didn’t know I was pregnant yet.
His family was sitting around the table and we were talking about work and catching up on life events when our of nowhere my MIL says “maybe your parents didn’t come this year because your dads beating your mom” me”what?” She shrugged “maybe your dads really beating your mom and they don’t want you to see the bruises.” I’m dumb founded, but brush her off. My mom is a very strong woman and would never let a man lay a hand on her and my dad would never be the man to raise his hand to a woman.
We all ignore MIL and talk amongst ourselves. Drinks get poured and they star making light fun that I’m not drinking. I make a few drunk jokes at my expense and my MIL gets angry thinking in her narcissistic mind that I’m talking about her.
She gets up glares at me and throws her drink in the sink and storms off. All of us are confused but know she prone to being dramatic and let her have her fit. 
She wouldn’t sit with us at dinner and refused to speak with me for the rest of the night.
My husbands plan was to put the ultrasound picture in his favorite childhood book and give it to her. He handed it to her and she cooed over it saying “aw this was your favorite. I used to read this to you all the time” and my husband was getting excited.
She opens the book, sees the ultrasound picture and her face falls and goes “oh, congrats.”
My husband, confused and dejected, says “congrats? That’s all I get?” MIL gets up and gives him a hug before pushing the ultrasound picture into his hands and sulks on the couch. 
Later in the car my husband was disgusted by his mom. This wasn’t the first thing she had done to him over the years and their relationship is strained. I said I don’t want her in my life, but my husband can take baby to see her whenever he wanted without me. He says he’s okay with that and doesn’t know if he wants her in our child’s life. But would that make us the ahole?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not wanting to care for husbands 85 year old grandparent.,"My MIL and her father live 7 hours away. A bit of history is my MIL has always been unwilling to help out with any childcare for our 3 children 9,11,13) this is no problem for us and we have accepted the fact that we chose to have children, with or without help from family. Husband has worked from home for 3 years due to covid. MIL who receives carers allowance for her father who has dementia and other health conditions (generally frail). She has an “family” apartment abroad where she goes there for 3-4 weeks in may to open up, and 3-4 weeks in September to close it down. She usually books these holidays without consulting and of her family and then expects people to swap and change their plans to care for the grandparent. Usually this entails DH driving 7 hours each way to collect grandparent along with 2 cats. We have suggested it maybe easier to deliver him to us on the train and then fly from an airport close to us. 

Just to add some more info, my husband and I are not allowed to go to the apartment in the summer holidays as she rents it out to other people, however keeps insisting it is a family apartment. 

However for the past 6 months DH has moved abroad for work and rarely gets to come home. He has already has a conversation with his mother about trying to liaise with us before she books another holiday, so that the grandparent is safe and looked after. And maybe suggested that a week would be enough.

We have just found out that MIL has booked a 3 week trip away in may, without talking to any of us. DH wants me to care for his grandfather for the 3 weeks, otherwise he will be left with a carer coming in 3 x per week, and he doesn’t think this is safe. I have said I find it quite stressful and draining especially since DH will not be there to help and I have 3 children and other commitments. Caring includes assisting with showering, cooking for and giving medication including insulin. 

I am annoyed at MIL as she is very selfish and only thinks about herself, she would never ever look after our children for us. When we lived close to her, we had 2 children at the time, husband booked for us to go away to a spa hotel for the night, she had agreed to watch kids, then she cancelled last minute with no excuse, my family had to meet halfway down the country and collect the children so that we wouldn’t lose our money for the hotel. I think she is entitled to a holiday but should maybe pay to put her father in respite care.

Would she be responsible as his career if anything happened to him. Historically he falls over during the night, and has needed ambulance to take him to hospital. He has has several strokes, and has also suffered from depression. I’m stuck what to do.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my husband his input on exciting life event was demeaning and over the top,"Two years ago, I suffered an injury that caused me to have to quit the career I had for 18 years and was deeply passionate about. I was later able to find a job that’s in a very different career working from home. It’s going well, but doesn’t match my passion and there’s a hole in my heart that misses that energy and purpose. 
Two days ago I was contacted for an opportunity to teach a massage therapist my second language so she could have the ability to communicate with some of her clients. She’s also wanting to have the fluency to get into that niche. I was on cloud 9 - so excited! She mentioned trading massages for lessons or paying for my time. 
I’m f38 my husband (m41). Married 2 years. Instead of him sharing my excitement, he started listing issues he says I have and crushed my spirit…
“I need to only focus on the job I have and earning a raise. I’m easily distracted…
That I overcommit myself and take on way too much than I should. helping people and giving them my time. 
That she would be taking advantage of my value, education, and skills to just pad her pockets with money, etc. That how much I’m going to be paid is the defining factor in saying yes. (Not to me) 
I found this even more infuriating since he is not working, doesn’t plan to, and I feel like I carry all the weight. Pay all the bills, clean, work, etc. It really rubs me wrong that he thinks I need to stay on my butt about everything or I won’t be able to manage my life or prioritize tasks. He said I’m impossible to talk to because I get so offended and his role is too make me aware of issues and give the input. AITA or is he just controlling and demeaning?",Not the A-hole
AITA for shouting at my friend's autistic brother?,"my friend, 14f  is sleeping over at my, 14f, house for 3 days with her autistic 11m brother.  at lunch today it was the worst. he was on our case non-stop or a whole hour. he complained about me chewing too loud, then because i had my elbows on the table, then because the tv was too loud, then because his juice was too cold. im really not trying to be rude but ive watched videos about autism and if im being honest i think he was intentionally trying to get on my nerves. he said he wanted to go home, then spilled the juice on the floor and then started apologizing over and over and over and over and over again. so annoying. my friend helped me clean up the mess and she told him to watch TV. surprise surprise the TV is too loud and he starts bugging out again and throws the remote under the cabinet. so i took off my glasses to get the remote from under and then i hear a crunch and then sorry sorry sorry sorry again. he broke my glasses so i shouted he should go to his room or i'll get my dad to kick him out because he's really annoying me. then he started crying. he's still in his room and my dad comes back in an hour, what now? do i just wait or what? my friend says it's because he doesn't like the new environment, so what am i meant to do bout that?",Not enough info

We got into a big argument which led to me going to to my friends house for the week. I have been getting phone calls and messages from family saying I had no right going off on my parents

Sorry about not giving enough info but my bf has skin cancer  and I was constantly panicking which led to what parents said",Not enough info
AITA for refusing to go to my own birthday dinner.,"Using a throw away because my sil knows my main.
So a little back story I (25f) and my husband V(36) have been married for 5 years. It was arranged by my grandfather and his uncle, we are not American so it's common here.
V wasn't too thrilled about the marriage and he made it very clear because he was already in a relationship with F(30sF).
Long story short V,his family and F did the most to make my life hell and my dumbass was stuck on the idea that one day he might change.
About 3 years ago I found out I was pregnant and I was excited but he wasn't given we only had sex a handful of times before that he got it into his head that it wasn't his,the baby had complications and I had to get a medical abortion. Not once did he or his family come to the hospital and I guess that opened my eyes and I just stopped caring. 
I stopped trying,I just stopped caring. 
Early last year,he suddenly started caring, coming home early,calling me,bringing me flowers,it was quite uncomfortable for me. Then he tells me that he's had a change of heart and wants to try to better our marriage because he's developed feelings for me???? It's all fishy to me honestly,I wouldn't trust this man as far as I can throw him.
He's been doing these little things and I just can't shake that there's a joke coming at my expense.
Now onto the story,it was my birthday last weekend and V told me his family was hosting me a birthday dinner,I told him I wasn't comfortable with that and the last time I was at his parents they literally told me I was my babys complications were my fault and kicked me out coz F was uncomfortable not to mention that they haven't apologized,just started acting friendly.
I kept telling him no and he kept insisting,he let it go and I assumed that was that,I made plans and went out with my mom and cousins and he starts calling me asking me where I am,I tell him and he tells me that he's waiting for me uhhm what????
Long story short,he's family is mad that I skipped because they apparently wanted to apologize so that we could move forward and V keeps saying he understands why I did it but has been apologizing for everything and noyhing.
last night  F called to cuss me out because they've left her high and dry and V wants nothing to do with her so maybe they did want to apologize.
I thought I was in the right but now even my cousins are telling me I was wrong for skipping,now am doubting myself AITA?

Mini update/edit: wow! I wasn't expecting this to get as much attention as it has. Am overwhelmed and am sorry if I won't manage to reply to everyone. Thank you for your kind words and advice. 
Some more info on my family because I saw repeating questions in the comments,my family didn't know about most of what was going on,I chose to not tell them,but they still found out were and are still willing to handle the effects of me leaving but I can't let them do that, everyone is happy and this would disrupt their lives greatly,I can't bring myself to that especially to my little nieces.
A few hours after I made the post I decided to have a talk with V after he came home from work.
It went somewhat ok,I followed some advice in the comments about starting over on my terms.
I asked him questions I needed answers to and he gave me answers,I wasn't completely satisfied but it's a start.
I told him I would give our marriage a chance but he had to know that he was completely done with F and would be completely on board with this,I told him to stop with the love bombing because it was making me uncomfortable,I told him I would absolutely not be having kids in the near future. I told him I was in no way ready to be his wife and we would continue with our separate rooms.
Surprisingly,he was on board with all of this and said that he wasn't a boy anymore and that he was getting older ant he needed to sort himself out and make things right, I asked him if he only had a change of heart because he wanted me to take care of him in his old age and he said no, he said he realised that F isn't what he's always wanted and started seeing her manipulate toxic ways (his words),he said he was willing to put the house in only my name (it's 40%mine) entirely as a way of showing that he is all in and would mess up of I give us a second chance.
He said he was willing to give me as much space as I need. He said he'll have a word with his family about me needing time and space and taking baby steps
Honestly,don't know where this will go at this point. I don't know the direction in which we are headed but am willing to try so I can have a free conscious. I've started making a back up plan to leave but thats in the worst case scenario
I'll update if anything significant happens.

UPDATE:
Hey everyone. So a few things happened that I thought y'all needed to know.
First off,I'd like to thank everyone for your care and support,I never thought I'd cry after reading words but you have no idea how much courage your kind words have given me.
I told V to go through with the transfering of the house into my name and he did,I guess he knew he would be getting more money. So now I own the house. 
Nobody was telling me anything about the 180 change do I decided to go to F(I know it was stupid). She was the only one who was willing to give me any information since she's spiteful and I think I got what I needed. It's not much but it's enough to cement my decision.
Turns out, F had her womb removed when she was younger so she can't give V children,the whole family found out and turned against her. And Uncle has been speaking of retiring and V has been at war with Uncles sons to either take over the business or become one of th decision makers and a child would guarantee that he would give a large sum of the company shares that would be in his name and the child's and since F couldn't give him a child,I was the solution. F told me as much as she knew, and so I went to one of Vs cousins I confronted him about what F said and after a heated back and forth he finally confirmed everything.
I don't know why but that hurt,even though I knew it was too good to be true I still held onto hope that maybe I was wrong.
After conversation I decided to play along until I could get out. He completely cut of F and it's scary just how much he's acting like she never existed.
I put in a transfer to a city 12 hours away from here,my headteacher knows my situation and swore not to tell the.
I brought up moving to my family and majority of them said I'd be selfish if I did that and their whole lives are here and all that but honestly i feel I should put myself first,I told them it was just a thought and that I would never do that. My mom and brother have been my biggest support system and am taking them with me,my cousins is moving with my little nieces to his wife city. So that's that.
I found a house where my mom,brother,two cousins and I will stay.
I listed this house for sale on a private auction page. (this will cause a big blow out but I won't be here so lol).
I live this place in about a 40 days and the most tiring thing is to get my affairs in order without rising suspicion.
I refused to be intimate with V and told him I wasn't ready he told me we'll work on my time but I see him getting more and more frustrated each day.
Even though am scared for myself and my family on what they will do when they find out I've decide to leave and am not changing my mind. Am still young and I honestly don't want to end up like my mother,in a loveless marriage with a cheating alcoholic.
I took words of internet strangers for me to realize that and am so grateful. Am sorry if this is all over the place.
I'll update if anything changes.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my mom I'll (27F) never forgive her if my dad dies?,"Please don't post this anywhere else. I don't want this on Facebook or something.
  
 Sorry if there's errors or I don't give enough info.
   
 We found out a few months ago that my dad has cancer and a very bad form at that. He's been doing fairly well with the treatment so far, but infections and sickness are still a big worry. I found out yesterday that my brother who I'll call Ryan (45M) is getting kicked out of his apartment because its a health hazard. His landlord said he's basically going to have to gut the whole place and redo it, because there is no getting it clean. So, my mom told Ryan that he could move back in with them.
    
 I want to be clear that Ryan has no mental health issues. He's always been like this and he's been to so many psychiatrists that have said there is nothing wrong with him. Everytime he says that hes trying to quit our mom gives him her whole paycheck to get new clothes and games and whatever he wants 'to help him'.
 
   The other thing about Ryan is he doesn't take care of himself because it gets him attention and drugs that is his own words. He can't get pain pills from ER's or his normal doctor anymore so he let his teeth rot to the point that they are infected so dentists would give him pain meds. Our mom has turned him into this. She wouldn't let our dad help raise him and she gives Ryan everything he wants because she doesn't want to see 'her only little boy' upset or sad. 
  
 So, my dad talked to his doctors that are concerned about Ryan being around because in addition to his teeth he has open infected sores all over the place. Ryan hasn't done laundry in 8 months because when his stuff gets too dirty mom just buys him new stuff. I know it sounds like he has depression but he brags all the time about how he does this for stuff and money. When i asked him about why he would put himself through that much pain for what mom would give him anyway he said that's what the pills are for and he's learned that mom will give him more if he appears sick. 

  My mom and I got into a fight today because I told her that I think it is really selfish that she's moving Ryan in regardless of the doctors concerns and her husband's comfort. She said that Ryan could help take care of him and maybe the two could bond more. I brought up the infections and she said that Ryan won't take antibiotics but he's using home remedies to keep the infections under control. His home remedy is vinegar, he claims it helps but the infections are still there. I told her that if she moves Ryan in and dad dies from something that he catches from Ryan or from mold in the house because there will be mold that I will never forgive her then I hung up on her. Then the phone calls and texts started from other family members telling me that she's really struggling emotionally right now and she's doing the best she can to help everyone and that I can't ask her to choose between her husband and children because that's not fair. So,AITA?

Edit: I didn't give a TL:DR because of the limit. But my mom wants to move my infected brother and all his mold covered belongings into the same house as my dad who is going through chemo. So I told her if my dad got sicker and died because of my brother I would never forgive her.

Edit/kind of update: thank you all so much for the support. It's nice to not feel crazy. 

A lot of people have brought up dads meds. That was a concern of mine too. I talked to him about that and he already has all his meds in a lockbox that he has the only key in the house to and he counts his pain pills everytime he takes one. 

He also has a nurse that comes by once a month to check that he's being cared for and that he has food and his meds who holds the other key to that lockbox because he's explained to her that his son is an addict. 

I talked to him again about moving with me and he's not saying no he's just saying to wait a bit. I don't agree but he's an adult i can't force him.  He's going to bring this up to his nurse because there might be some resources that she has access to. And I'm going to look into what I can do from here.",Not the A-hole
AITA for lashing out at my dad when he decides how i feel?," 

My (15m) entire family got sick 3 days ago. We all got the winter sickness, at the same time as i already had influenza. I puked in the middle of the night, and have since felt extremely weak, and in extreme pain by any motion. I can't walk without supporting myself with the furniture around me, and feel extremely light headed. Even if i stand up extremely slowly, my vision sometimes goes dark, black dots appear, and i feel my conciousness drift away. My dad (58m i think, im bad with ages, including my own family's) was the first to get sick, and the first to get healthy. The difference was only a couple of hours, he was at work, and suddenly felt extreme nausea, he barely managed to drive himself home, and soon thereafter puked. I got sick maybe 5 hours later. But the huge difference is, the next day, he was pretty much fine. While the rest of my family were puking, and feeling terrible, he was as healthy as always, and just had some minor symptoms left that dont affect his mobility.

My dad is determined that he knows how i'm feelin, despite me still being unable to eat anything except [this](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fd1hr6nb56yyl1.cloudfront.net%2Fproduct-images%2F22951-560.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mat.se%2Fbutik%2Fsmorgasran-vete-goteborgs-kex-170g&tbnid=KuLdI6BUuXDv5M&vet=12ahUKEwju0sObjtz2AhUB3OAKHZJWBSoQMygAegUIARCpAQ..i&docid=yZOCBTBXTrs0eM&w=560&h=560&q=sm%C3%B6rg%C3%A5sr%C3%A5n&ved=2ahUKEwju0sObjtz2AhUB3OAKHZJWBSoQMygAegUIARCpAQ). Anyways, this is enough info, the convo with my dad went something like this:

""How are you feeling op?""

""Not very good, my neck hurts alot, my arm feels extremely painful and my leg feels like it's asl-""

""No, no you don't. How is your stomach?""

""What do you mean no? You didn't even let me-""

""No, i asked, how is your stomach?""

""I woke up 2 seconds ago, but at the moment i feel a bit nauseos, and i don't feel any h-""

""Okay, good, seems like you can go to school tommorow. Have you done your homework?""

""You know i haven¨'t done it yet, you've seen me in bed the last few d-""

""Then go do them, here, i brought you some soda. Drink up""

""Dad, this is not okay. If you ask someone how they feel, you don't decide for them! I'm not feeling well, and just woke up. I'm in extreme pain, can't you atleast care a little?""

""Yes, when i was your age, i already had rheumatism(Basically causes a lot of pain) but i still went to school. And you want to talk about pain? Kids these days have no respect. Go to your room, now.""

""You know i can't do that, i feel nauseos, and can't lay on a flat surface. But that's besides the point, why do you get to decide how i feel, dad? It's happening all over again, isn't it dad. You get to decide how i feel, this is not okay, have you already forgotten what \*therapist name's\* told you?""

AITA?

My dad didn't really say anything else, he just got upset, left, and hasn't talked to me since. I feel like an ah for mentioning my therapist since my dad despised that period of time.

Update: 

Hey, so im gonna give a quick rundown of how everything has panned out. As cygnata (a commentator from previous post) adressed, i had really low blood sugar and really needed to do something. As they said, i contacted my cousins husband, and he gave me a method to help. Not gonna type it here, but he uses it himself every time he gets sick. Not gonna share anything else as most of that is private conversation, and i havent asked if im allowed to include it here.  

And as for the actual reason for my previous post. I tried to put my foot down about it, but it didnt go that well, the convo was a couple days ago, so i dont really remember everything that clearly, especially with the light headedness i had, but basically i asked confronted him and asked him to apologize. My dad asked what for, i told him, and he said that never happened, which is really normal. I didnt back down immediately, and insisted i get an apology for his behaviour.

He insisted it never happened, and told me to apologize to him for making things up and confronting him over nothing. I told him ive had enough of this, hes told me so many times that it didnt happen, your overreacting, its all in your head, and i doubt myself alot, but i was certain this time. I litteraly made the post in anger and doubt about myself immediately afterwards, i dont believe i would do that over an hallucination. Basically, i relented and accepted that i imagined it, just like 50 or so other incidences.

Case was ""resolved"", and i havent brought it up again. Not a very satisfying update, but a update nontheless. I realize how badly my dad behaved in my ""imagined"" scenario, and really feel that something has to change. But im still constantly getting flack for involving the government in our family, and thats not just by my closest family members, but some close friends and other relatives. So i dont want to involve them again, especally after we left it on such a high note, i feel im just bringing the whole family down.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not defending my husband against my parents.,"TLDR: AITA for not defending my husband against my parents and thinking that issues he has, he should bring it up with them himself?

My (f36) husband (m44) does not get along with my parents at all. It’s gone that bad that any mention of them is a trigger for him to spout off on how much he dislikes them. 
So basically my parents haven’t been in touch with him for about 5 months now. They were privy to some things he has said about them.

The first problem began 4 years ago when my parents were over and we were having a discussion about things to do with a sibling of mine, of which I’m no contact with, my mother made a comment to my partner about something to do with being a Christian and showing love, he took offence to it and walked away. He came back to the discussion to say that he had been tempted to kick them out but obviously he didn’t and we came at an impasse and that wasn’t discussed again. My parents took it on the chin. 


So a couple of years ago, my mother made a comment in jest about our daughter. (Being an unfriendly toddler 🙄 it was said in another language that we speak but not to be taken seriously.)
My husband took offense even though I didn’t, and he wanted an apology from my mother. It never came forth, and he was like if she can’t apologize then she can’t look after the kids. I told my mother this and she got so upset. Realizing this, my husband went to their house to apologize for the comment but the damage was done. 

They didn’t talk to him for months but they were overseas during this time anyway. In any case, my mother didn’t apologize in any form even as I appealed to them in a letter how much it bothered him and he hadn’t meant any harm saying what he did. He was just frustrated. 
I still entertained them and spoke to them while they were overseas, even though he was pissed off at them. 
 
There was some reconciliation up until this year. 

My husband feels like my parents don’t do enough, aren’t involved enough. He’s pissed that he feels like they get to be fun grandparents without putting in the hard yards of always being present. (Whatever that means.) like literally not helping out.  
To me, when they’d come past and entertain the kids, I was happy with that but he never was.  He felt like they could be doing more, especially around the house. My mum would help me and would try and get me to rest while she took care of things. 

In his opinion, they owe it to us considering what he has done for them. When they’ve been away, he’s helped me tidy up their house. He and I did flat pack furniture together for their hobby farm 2 hours away, setting up the furniture.  So it’s not as if he wasn’t trying to be Involved. 

I don’t know what do. Is he justified? Am I an asshole wife for not defending him enough or for not washing my hands clean of my parents? 
In all honesty, I feel like he’s put me in the middle and it sucks. But I’ll accept judgment, whatever it is.


ETA: Hey everyone, thank you for commenting on my thread and I apologize for not giving enough info. I thought I had enough considering there’s a word limit. 
All I can say is, is that I swear on 
my life that my parents have never intended any ill-will. They’re not around off enough for that anyway as they travel a lot of the time (pre-Covid). Definitely not like my older in-laws who I love dearly but stuck in their ways of family life. (Nothing wrong with that). 
I think he compares them, my parents and his. Like he has said it himself that I should consider his parents more my parents as they are always doing something for us.
I know material stuff isn’t important and this will be superficial but my parents love language are gifts, so they’ve been very generous. Even now my parents have told me to consider my mortgage (I bought an investment property before I got married) paid off so I didn’t have to worry about it and could use the rent money to build with my husband later. 
I think they just rub my husband up the wrong way because if they can get along well with my in-laws and my BIL, why don’t they get along with my husband?

I really don’t know anymore, everyone. I accept all judgment, even the YTA because you’re right, spouses should support one another and spouses shouldn’t vent to family members about their SO.

I’m just desperate for clarity.

ETA 2: just last week my dad posted a picture of our daughter for her birthday on my side of the family’s WhatsApp group. That includes aunts, uncles and cousins. It doesn’t really bother me but my husband has said before that he doesn’t like it and has told my dad this. I said to my husband that I’ll tell my dad that we didn’t appreciate the post but then my husband said to me not to. 
I spoke to my dad that day and didn’t mention it. 
My husband tells me “why didn’t you say anything?!”

AITA for refusing to go to my family events?,"I (19 F) quit going to my family events because I refused to eat the same food as them. My mom's side of the family thinks I'm being a child and throwing a fit because I am refusing to eat the gluten-free food they prepare for me due to celiac disease.  I'm not comfortable eating at most others house's since my diagnosis, well my family always has get-togethers sounding a meal, now that I have to be gluten-free I've tried making things easier and just bringing my own food to each event. Well, they would always make something gluten-free so I can be included, I however never tried any of it due to my fear of cross contamination. My family started to notice this and asked why I told them, and they told was rude for not just trying the dishes they prepared, and they put in alot of effort to make me feel included while that was never asked from me I appreciated the thought and maybe in the future would try one when I was more comfortable.  This caused a huge fight where everyone but my mom, dad, and sister were saying I was rude. I repeatedly tried to explain and stop the fighting with no avail. They dragged my mom into it, saying it was her fault and blaming her for my rude behavior. So I decided that I would quit joining the family on meal based get-togethers and moat other events qll together. This caused everyone to get even worse, saying I was a child who was just rude and used to getting everything I wanted.

AITA for telling sister we can’t be roommates bc I don’t want men I don’t know in the hypothetical apartment,"Final update: I’m distancing myself. Here is what happened earlier today:

Today we had family visit from out of town. Everyone was home and Alice came to visit. I happened to ask if they were going to get lunch and they said they’re going to some restaurant that I don’t I don’t like. I just said ok and that I’m going to run errands. The family member parked behind me and said they’d leave in a minute. 
I walked outside to my car and my friend called me. I was talking on the phone and sitting in my car when I see Alice walk up to my car and asking where I was getting lunch. I just said I’m running errands. She then help my door open and kept asking me and saying she knew I was getting lunch and wanting to come with me. 

I was still talking to my friend and told her to leave me alone. She then stopped when she saw the family member walk out. 


Edit 4: I got approved for the apartment!!! I move soon.

Edit 3: I’m looking for one bedroom because the 2 bedroom is another $400/m and don’t think it’s worth it atm. I’m getting a second bed for the bedroom we’ll share.  My couch also has a pull out bed so she can have the bedroom to herself although she likes to co-sleep atm. The living room is also big enough for regular furniture plus a twin bed without it getting cluttered.

Edit 2: some people seem to think I’m shaming my sister for having guys visit her place; I should’ve explained why it’s an issue. I’m big on safety and taking precautions. my daughter likes to visit and sometimes sleep the night and just hangout with her aunt/my sister. I allow it since sometimes I go and my sister lives alone. If I have to go to my office for a few hours on weekends, she sometimes goes to my sisters place.
When my sister told me that she gave a guy her key for a bit it made me feel uncomfortable so I nicely suggested that she get her locks changed. Keep in mind she told me she knew this guy for maybe 2-3 weeks. My mind went to my daughter. What if this guy made a copy of the key and randomly comes over, especially when my daughter is there.when I said that, she got mad and said the guy wouldn’t do that. Again, I nicely explained that she doesn’t know for sure and I’m just concerned about her safety.

Edit 1: I forgot to add ages. I’m 30 and she’s 28. My daughter is 6. I also work from home.

I’m a single mom (widow) and I went to get info on a one-bedroom apartment I love. My sister tagged along and in order to get a move-in special, I had to do another tour and it was the first time she’d toured it. She already has an apartment but loved the complex I’m moving to.

Afterwards, my sister asked if I wanted to be roommates. I don’t want a roommate. Keep in mind I’ve told my family about the apartment and they all know im only looking at one-bedrooms. I want to build my life and this will be the first time of having my own place as a single mom (lived with parents then with my fiancé before I ended the relationship last year). Honestly, she isn’t dependable financially or time wise. She also has a history of letting guys she barely knows come to her apartment and give them a key. Im not judging as that’s her choice but I am not ok with that all so I just said reasons that I didn’t think would offend her.



First I said no because you can’t smoke “Grass” there. She said she would do it on the balcony and I said you can’t because the complex is strict about it. (It’s brand new apartments and quality housing is hard to find here so I’m not risking anything just so someone can smoke.

She then said that she’d just go to a friends house to smoke and asked what other reasons do I have. 

At that point, I had to be direct and say that we can’t be roommates because I wouldn’t be comfortable with non-related men in the apartment and she got pissed and asked me why.

I have a very young daughter and don’t like being around men I don’t know so I only want to live my just my daughter. I want to be independent and have a stable lifestyle for the two of us.

I said that I understand if she’s comfortable with guys she knows but don’t know them and will not be comfortable. I would only be okay with our dad, brothers and a trusted male family friend that would  only visit and I would pay to help with moving, putting furniture together, etc.

She was mad and then said that if it’s her place too then she should be able to bring the guy. Remember, this is a hypothetical apartment and she knows that I only looked at and only getting a one bedroom apartment.

I told her that I understand but I don’t agree so that’s why I can’t live with someone else bc I’m very strict about that. She then said whatever and acted mad towards me.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not wanting to know anything about my best friend’s relationship?,"I (22 F) and John (22M) have been best friends for the last 5 years. A month ago, it was by birthday, i decided to invite John and the rest of my friend group, including my other best friend Alice (21F). The other person I invited was a friend of the family, Sue (21F).
Sue and I were never that close, we grew up together because our parents are friends. She even slut shamed me when we were 18, but since we matured a bit, i forgave her and felt comfortable enough with her to invite her to my birthday.

Before the party i let everyone in my friend group, including John and Alice, know that i invited Sue. But i said jokingly “none of you are allowed to hook up with her"" since we have an inside joke in the group that we shouldn't date or hook up with each others friends.

The day comes and everything is going well, i got drunk pretty fast, so i went to sleep and missed the end of the party.
A few days later John tells me he and Sue hooked up the night of the party. I tell him that i explicitly told him not to do it, but i’m not mad, but please don't tell me about it or give me details because i don’t want to know. He apologizes but i tell him i can't tell him what to do or who to hook up with, but that i don't want to know anything.

Around a week passes and he tells me ""guess who i just hooked up with"" and, suspecting, i tell him ""do i wanna know?"" and he replies ""i don't think you do"" but still tells me the whole story that he saw Sue again and they hooked up. I tell him, please don't tell me.

for the last couple of weeks he has been telling me every time they hang out or call each other, I try to ignore this messages or abruptly change the subject since i have told him several times that i don't want to know.

Yesterday i snapped, he texted me ""guess who picked me up from class today, it was Sue"" i ignored the message and just asked him how was his class and ignored the Sue part, but he kept insisting so i sent him this: ""dude john, you're my best friend, and i really like Sue, but i don't want to know that you're talking. I know i can't tell you who to date or what to do, but i've asked you several times to not tell me when you hang out. You know that my friends dating is kinda weird to me, i love you and i support you so please respect me on this""

He apologized and said he only told me because i'm his best friend and we dropped the subject.

Today i got a text from Alice, telling me that John was upset that i didn't want to hear anything about his relationship with Sue, she called me selfish and controlling, and that i count tell John who to date. I told her i never told him to stop seeing Sue, i just don’t want details.

Still both Sue and John are casual daters and i've never seen either of them in serious relationships or seeing the same person for more than a couple of months, their relationship is not ""serious"" (their words) so i don't think i'm being the AH here.",Not the A-hole
"AITA for saying ""I don't know"" to my grandma?","I, (13 F) was helping my grandma, (87 F) to our dinner table. She asked me if my cousin (mid 20's) was home as we passed his room. I said ""I don't know"" in our native language (I don't think saying what I said exactly would be allowed as it isn't in English, but it basically just means 'I don't know""). She then said ""Why are your answers always negative?"" I didn't see how it was negative but I said ""I'm not required to know if he's home or not."" and she proceeds to say ""Yes ..but why can't you say it in a nicer way?"" I was speechless. My dad heard and proceeded to shout at me asking what I told her. I simply repeated what I said. (I can't really remember everything, my memory is bad for my age. This will be slightly important as I will not and cannot make this very detailed anyway.) 
A few moments later, we are eating dinner and she says something along the lines of ""You always say you don't know. At least give some importance to your cousin."" I couldn't say ""I don't give a crap. He isn't my priority, and it's not my obligation to know about his whereabouts."" She then continues to say stuff about how disrespectful ""I don't know"" sounds, how I should say something else instead of ""I don't know"", I should have a nicer tone, yada yada. My dad says I should have said something like ""He's not home"" even if that means I know about where he is but him being the narcissist he is, talked over me (I don't remember what he said.) 
small edit before I post - I remember him saying my grandma is old and needs more attention because she's emotional ..what about me, though? This may be slightly irrelevant.

This is basically it, I could really continue if I remembered the rest but even if I did, it would just be redundant as they kept saying and asking the same things over and over. 
Ah, and yes I found out about this subreddit on tiktok, but I need genuine opinions on this.

WIBTA if I denied all of my MIL's life wishes?,"TL;DR: Future MIL has wishes and expectations of having grandbabies, raising the grandbabies, living with her son, being taken on vacations, and being given financial support that they don't need. This is culturally in line with what can be expected in their home country, but I don't care and plan to reject every single one.

\-

My partner (31m) and I (26f) have been together for more than 7 years. I'd like to ask reddit's judgment so I can decide to either stand my ground or reconsider the hills I die on.

For background, partner's parents are immigrants who moved to the US a couple decades ago. They're the typical rags-to-comfort immigrant story. Now they own a house, are healthy, relatively young, still work, have built up a social network of friends locally. These past few years, future MIL has shared her life wishes for the following, all of which belong in the ""hell to the no, f\*\*k that"" category for me:

* She wants bio babies. - Currently, we are in the childfree camp. She's distraught about this and brings up the topic multiple times.
* She expects to live with us. - She has offered to ""gift"" us a downpayment under the condition we get a house with a permanent space for them. Also insists she'll move in with us when we get our own place so she can ""help"" raise the babies. I would be open to living with her only if medically necessary.
* She expects to be taken on extravagant vacations. - She recently learned of our couple's international trip and is demanding to be treated to future out of country vacations because she is getting ""old and you don't know how much time we have left together""
* She expects money. - She has asked for money and it is the expectation that we give the parents part of our monthly income, even though they don't need it? Not to mention I have tons of student loans and no savings yet. They ask for our financial info like salary, loans, expenses, etc. I keep everyone on an info diet but my partner does not.

To me, the above sounds sprinkled with guilt trips and feels like MIL wants to be my partner's wife. I myself come from an immigrant family (different country but culturally similar) and so I am VERY familiar with the dynamics and expectations from their home country. It is PRECISELY why these life ""goals"" of my future MIL were my dealbreakers before I even met her. I have experienced and witnessed enough emotional manipulation, loss of privacy/autonomy, marriage strain, etc. through my own family.

I love my partner and am ok with building boundaries as long as we have each others' backs. As I find myself having similar issues with both sets of parents due to cultural expectations, I am thinking that my approach may be too abrupt (single generation overhaul of their wishes) and maybe I should compromise. For now this is a hill I will die on.

Reddit, would I be the asshole for denying what seems like the culturally normal life wishes of my future MIL?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not wanting to wear a dress to my uncles wedding?,"I (21f) are going to attend my uncles wedding a month from now, my uncle is very kind to me but his soon to be wife, not so much. She wants a formal wedding where boys wear suits and girls wear dresses but the thing is, I personally dislike dresses and don’t feel comfortable in one. I told them I wouldn’t feel comfortable and would prefer wearing a suit. My uncle was fine with it but his fiancé went crazy, calling me all sorts of things. 

I already bought a suit but his fiancé bought me a hot pink dress and when she saw my suit went even more crazy, I mean I thought the suit atleast looked nice but she said I’d look horrible and I should wear the dress. 

Soon enough the whole side of the family found out about it and messaged me saying it’s just one day and I should deal with it and just wear a dress, but I still didn’t wish to wear it. I’m nothing important in the wedding, just a guest so i thought it shouldn’t really matter. But now my uncles fiancé is getting angry and upset and now, my family says it’s my fault. 

So AITA for not wanting to wear a dress to my uncles wedding? 

Edit:I was given permission from the groom (my uncle) to wear a suit to the wedding. He was paying everything for the wedding so he said that it was his call and and I could wear it. His fiancé went mad about it but he said it was formal and he never agreed to girls must wear dresses and boys must wear suits, he agreed to formal so that’s why. 

Another edit lol: ever since she met my uncle she knew I was a tomboy; I told her myself I didn’t like dresses and she saw all the suits I owned growing up, she knew this for all the 10 years they were together before he proposed. I’ve always told my family I didn’t feel comfortable and they understood but now they dismissed it and if I’m honest, I’m thinking of not going since if it’s that much of an issue to my family of what I wear I really don’t feel like sitting in a room with them, in a hot pink dress, uncomfortable and still having to deal with my family.

WIBTA if I tell my doctor he is not doing enough to help me,"Hello, but of a confusing one because I can’t get my thoughts in order. Anyway I have a host of mental health issues that I am in therapy twice a week for. I’ve tried about 8 different medications. The main things I want help for is sleeping and nightmares from PTSD. I’m currently on olanzapine 5mg and it helps me stay asleep but I can’t fall asleep and I still have brutal nightmares. I’d like to tell my doctor that it is not enough but I am hesitant. The reason for this is that I have bad bad anxiety and a terrible fear of doctors. This means I freeze up and can’t make thought form in my head let alone get the words out. I end up stammering over my words and saying the wrong thing/ not giving the right info or enough info. 
This makes my doctor laugh at me. 
Also I told him my only reason for living is my husband which I know is bad but he just gave me a pamphlet on Jesus which I have previously (about 4 times) told him I’m not interested in at all. I want to tell him that I really need help and I am struggling a lot but I don’t want to be an asshole because he is just doing his job.

"AITA for leaving my cousin's wedding and taking back my gift because my dress was ""inappropriate""?","Hi all!  I (18F)  recently attended my cousin A's (25F) wedding in Australia. Lots went down, and I am getting flack for my dress. We are an Indian family, and A's husband M (26M) is white, so there were two ceremonies, like the Jonas-Chopra wedding. [This](https://www.panashindia.com/pink-floral-printed-georgette-lehenga-choli-2399lg01) is pretty similar I wore to the Indian ceremony, and to keep with the floral pink theme, I decided I would wear [this exact dress](https://www.lulus.com/products/remarkable-entrance-pink-floral-print-satin-midi-dress/1582436.html) to the Christian ceremony.

A is my favorite cousin and the one I'm closest to, so I decided to go all out with my gift. My family got them something, and I added a little envelope with a cheque for a grand that I had saved from working.

The ghagra choli was fine for the Indian ceremony, so I figured the dress would, too, because they look similar in color and pattern. However, my dress was deemed inappropriate by M's family, and they approached me saying so. I thought it was because of the slit, but they all said it looked too pale and unacceptable, even though it was a blush pink with bright, almost neon colors on it.  I said sorry, but I didn't have another dress suitable enough for a wedding that I could change into, and M's family seemed mad. I left it at that and went on with my day. The ceremony was beautiful, and I was happy for A and M.

However, when the wine started flowing at the reception, everything went out of control. I was on the dance floor partying it up with family and friends when I felt a splash down my front. I looked down, and I almost freaked out because I thought I got shot or something. There was this huge red wine stain dripping down my front, and I saw M's sister, mom, and aunt laughing, with M's sister holding a glass. I saw red, and that's when I snapped. I started yelling about how they ruined a brand-new dress for a stupid reason. They kept laughing, and I saw A giggle and M grin. That's when I decided I would leave and take back the cheque. That's when they stopped laughing. M started to ask me to stay, and when his fam realized how much money was in the envelope, they started to apologize and talk about how that money could be helpful in this economy. I left because I felt disrespected.

Now M, his family, and my parent all say it is bad taste for different reasons. My fam wants me to keep the peace, but I don't want to give my hard-earned money to horrid people. Now I am getting texts, DM's, and Whatsapp, and my phone is just blowing up. I refuse to talk to A until she gets her husband to apologize, and she is trying. He just won't. AITA?

Edit: my age! I am 18, not 19.

Also, I am from the United States, not Australia, for context! Also, at the Indian ceremony, A wore maroon red ( traditional Indian wedding colors) and, to the Christian, a white dress.

More info: it wasn't a conservative wedding by any means. The venue wasn't a church; it was this pretty outdoor botanical garden. As for A helping, as soon as she saw my face and reaction, she left to come to help me. I left her and walked out, yelling about me taking the money back, and that is when M's family tried to stop me.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not wanting to cook lunch/dinner for my bf's sister?,"Hey all, so my bf (29M) and I (27F) have been together for 7 years and living together for 4 years. We currently live in a condo that he owns so I pay him rent. My bf's sister (26F) recently moved in with us about four months ago because she got a job in our city. She pays him rent as well less than the market rate because she's family.

She's a nurse and she works day shifts about 3 days a week. My bf and I both work full time on a hybrid schedule. When she first moved in, I've been the one cooking our meals. I didn't mind at first because I'm the one that cooks for my bf and I, and we split up the chores evenly so that my bf is in charge of other things like laundry. I understand that moving to a new city and starting a new job is stressful, so my bf asked if we could help his sister out by cooking for her so that she doesn't have to worry about her meals and can focus on doing well at work. 

It's been four months now and I'm still preparing our meals (except breakfast, which we don't really eat anyway). Everyday my bf's sister asks me what can she expect for dinner, what time will dinner be ready, what food is she bringing for lunch tomorrow, makes requests when she doesn’t like our food, etc. 

I told my bf I think we can start having her prepare her meals, at least the meals that she brings to work since that is her responsibility. So we brought this up one day, but she begrudgingly agreed and countered that she needs all her free time to rest/recharge because her job is already so demanding and tiring. I told her that I'll still continue to cook but she can at least start to be responsible for her meals for work since she doesn't contribute to our shared meals. Then she got upset and said that we don't understand how stressful her job is and that we're making it worse for her, and if I'm already cooking anyway why make her cook her own meals.

Honestly I am tired of arguing, but I also don't want to cause a rift in the family because now she is complaining to their parents. Truly I understand that being a nurse is tough, but I don't see how she doesn't have any time at all to prepare her own meals. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not sharing elderberry syrup with my SIL's kids?,"We flew to visit my in-laws this past long weekend, and I pretty much always get sick after being in airports. During cold/flu season, my family (husband, 2 kids, and myself) take elderberry syrup every day. I'm not an elderberry disciple or anything, but we all made it through the season with only two mild colds, so I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing. During this trip, I had us take the elderberry syrup every day hoping it would help with the airport germs.

While we were there, my husband joined the rest of his family for a group therapy session. (You can check a prior post of mine for more info, but I don't think it's relevant to this incident.) I volunteered to watch SIL's kids during the session, which was at 9:30AM. My kids had already had breakfast, which is when we have the elderberry syrup, by the time SIL's kids got there. SIL's kids arrived at our rented house around 9:00AM and I was informed that they hadn't eaten yet, which kind of annoyed me because we try to only buy enough food for us to completely use up during the trip so we're not having to throw away food before we leave. But I scrounged up some breakfast for them and we can go to the grocery store again if we really need to. While I was digging in the refrigerator, the oldest (5yo) noticed the elderberry syrup and asked for some. I told him No for the following reasons:

1. We only had enough to get us through the long weekend and no way to get more there.
2. It's kind of expensive (for us) because we get it from a local seller and go through a lot with 4 people taking it.
3. I don't know if his mom would be OK with me giving it to him.
4. I was annoyed at having to feed them at all.

Of course I did not tell him any of those reasons, because he's 5; I just told him No, to which he pouted and whined for a bit and then moved on. When SIL came back to pick the kids up, he told her I wouldn't share with him, because of course he did, and she got upset for the following reasons:

1. It was rude to drink it in front of him and not offer him any. (We didn't. My kids and I had already long finished breakfast by the time they got there. He saw it in the refrigerator.)
2. It's not expensive (to her). (She doesn't actually know how much it costs, but she has a lot more money than us, so it's probably not expensive to her.)
3. Don't I want her kids to be healthy too? (I didn't know how to respond to this, so I just didn't.)

I shared my reasons, but she was still really upset about my ""being selfish around \[her\] kids"" and she left in a huff. My husband says I should've known that she would be upset about it and just given her kids some, since it's just a little bit each, but I don't think I was in the wrong to say No. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for finally telling my dad to go fuck himself,"Hello, this is the first time over ever posting on reddit. And I've never wrote anything this long so please don't hate on my grammar. So here it goes

At a very young age my father and mother separated due to him being a substance abuser (crack and alchohol) growing up my mother was always trying to make us feel better about the whole situation. Whenever my dad would cancle on us she would listen to our plees and take us over there to knock on his door. There were times I would see him walking on the other side of the door while I begged to see him. After a while we lost all contact to him. He abandoned us after that. When I was 16 I re connected with my father because his new girlfriend made him come to terms with his demons and he apologized and we went from there. At the age of 19 I went to join the military which in the same time he abandoned me again and moved across country and got married to another woman. Skip forward 5 years... I'm in contact with my dad and talking to him on a weekly basis just to stay in touch and update him on his grand daughter. On Thanksgiving I found out that he never told his wife about a large chunk of his life in which he abandoned us and was using drugs. I was heart broken but didn't say anything and just stopped messaging him. Well he messaged me a very long message while obviously drunk about how I at least owe him enough respect to keep his wife (who I've never met) in the loop since she going threw some medical things that could cause her death. He also told me how he was embarrassed and ashamed of me for not wishing her the best. So I snapped and told him ""Yeah well dad this is what happens when I find out you've been living a lie while every day I deal with the trauma of not having a dad. I had forgiven you completely because I thought you were living with your mistakes the same way I have been. But after finding out on Thanksgiving that the woman you love doesn't know who you are. It really opened my eyes that all the things you've done to us hasn't really affected you. And all it does is bring me anger and sorrow which then spreads into my family. I refuse to be an angry person or bitter. I don't want to hurt your feeling because I am not spiteful but finding out all of that really hurt me."" Which he replied ""lol I never abandoned anyone"" so I told him to go fuck himself. I hope I gave enough info to make judgment. If not I'll answer questions because honestly I feel like a huge piece of shit. No one should have to go threw watching their S/O die alone.",Not the A-hole

As of recent, there has been a lot of objectifying and sexualizing of my female coworkers by the kitchen staff. This makes me pretty uncomfortable to begin with, but even more so when they confront me and ask me what the kitchen is saying. I hear their complaints, I sympathize and want to do something because it affects me negatively as well.

While trying to maybe slow the situation and help out, I went to my boss and mentioned 2 examples of harassment about 2 separate girls. One girl feels as though I am overstepping because I am not the one being harassed, and I shouldn’t concern myself with it at all. 

I feel bad that the situation has gotten out as much as it has and that people are joking about it, but I’m uncomfortable with my coworkers being harassed and talked about behind their backs and want it to stop.

AITA for refusing to let my sister use my car?,"Alright so my sister (F26) and I (F22) live together and have been fairly close throughout our lives. She's always been there for me and I've always been there for her. Well recently her car got in a wreck and she's been without a car and still is without one until. So my sister asked me if she could borrow my car until she gets hers back, which should only be a week tops. The reason she asked me is because insurance doesn't want to give her a rental and the police department that I work for lets me take my car home and use it if I need to, meaning I can use it and she can have my car. That being said I don't really like people driving my car, I don't really have a reason I just don't.
When I told her that I didn't really want to she got irritated at me because I mainly use my take home car anyways. I told her that it didn't change the fact that I don't like others driving my car, even if she is family. This got into a pretty heated argument and it even went as far as my brother agrees with me but my parents agree with her, so honestly I'm wondering AITA?",Not enough info
AITA For Helping Wife With Medication But Not Owning It Fully,"Wife and I got in an argument this morning over me helping her take her medication.  

Background: wife has always struggled to remember to take her daily medication.  I started putting her pills out in the morning for her with juice to help her.  I'm not 100% consistent about it (I'm just as forgetful as she is and if I have work meetings in the morning before coffee, there's a good chance I'll either forget or not get to it until after she is up).  I'd say I do it about 50% of the time.  My intention was not to own the task, just to increase the probability that she'd take her medication.  

Today I did remember to ask if she took it (she hadn't) and got her medication for her.  She noted that I had not done it the day before and that it's only helpful if I remember to do it 100% of the time.  She was frustrated by the situation and it became an argument.  The crux of the conflict essentially became:  She doesn't feel like it helps her if I don't do it 100% of the time.  I feel unappreciated for helping her at all and having her get frustrated when it's not enough.  I do think she has a point about it not being helpful if it's not something she can rely on but I didn't think it was fair that she got angry at me.

Additional Info:

Wasn't a big fight, more a frustrated philosophical conflict.

The meds are supposed to be taken everyday, but it's not something that puts her in danger if she misses them.",Not the A-hole
AITA For cancelling my sons birthday after finding him smoking?,"I should probably give some backstory on this problem, just to make sure someone says that there isn’t enough info. My brother had died of lung cancer from smoking 12 years ago, and since then I have been constantly warning my children of the dangers of smoking. 

I’ve always been super scared of loosing my kids the same way I lost my brother, and just want them to be safe. 

I have been planning a birthday party for my son (he’s turning 19) as a farewell gift since he’s going to college in a few days. I wanted to make something big and extra for him, as this might be the last birthday party he may ever have. 

But we had recently had a fall out when my wife caught him smoking in his room, leading us into a huge argument, and I eventually decided to shut down the party. He’s now saying that it’s not fair, that he’s an adult and can do it if he wants. But the way is see it is that he lives in my house rent free, has his laundry done every week, and gets three meals a day. The least he could do is not smoke in my house until he moves out. I don’t want him to be a bad influence on my kids either.

Now I’m starting to feel like an asshole about this. I mean he’s right, he’s an adult, he can legally smoke, he made that decision. So Reddit, Am I The Asshole here?

Edit: I’ve seen the thing about him smoking indoors, but I should definitely say that he had his windows open. The whole point on me taking away his party was to teach him that there will be consequences for smoking, and I’m trying to kick some sense into him before he ruins his life. I’ve seen someone suffer from Lung Cancer, and I don’t want that to happen to my son.

Edit 2: I just had someone point this out, so I should clarify that I did set a rule to not smoke in my house. I’m going to talk to him later about why he did and why he smokes, so thanks for all the support. I’ll keep you updated.",Not the A-hole
AITA for questioning my partners finances?,"Okay so the background - we wanted a holiday but my partner kept telling me he didn't have enough money, couldn't afford to pay for a holiday and save up some spending money. It was a two week holiday and it cost $1600 for the accommodation. I really felt bad for my partner, he works hard and I wanted him to be able to have a break! So we talked and I offered to pay the holiday myself (I just about had enough saved up to pay for us both, so I literally emptied my savings account for this) and all he had to do was put some money aside out of each paycheck to spend whilst there. One week later, he sees an expensive piece of equipment he really wanted  around $500. I asked him how he would afford it, the response was ""I have a small amount of savings I will use as I've wanted this for a long time"". Okay, I'm annoyed but I dont say a word. I know how much the hobby means to him. I drove us to collect it from out of state and he is super happy. Fast forward a few days and he wants another very expensive item, costing around $300. So that's his half of the deposit money in full  so I questioned this and said ""hey, you told me you had no money, your item last week plus this would have covered your half of the deposit"" to which he FLIPPED. He was furious that I dared to question him, he said his money is his business and I have no right to question how he spends it. I agreed and I've never questioned it before but I explained why, as I used all my savings which took so long to build up. I have a really poor paying job. I got so much abuse, he threw things in my direction (nothing hit me he was aiming around me), I was told that I'm a control freak and ""well done for hiding it for so long but you're game is up now"". I'm so confused as I've never been controlling, he is free to do as he pleases and I never have questioned money before. I felt like I had been guilt tripped into paying for a holiday in full when he actually did have enough money there. I asked him to tell me the truth about his savings and he eventually showed me - there was around $11000. We booked in his name ( he is quite 'traditional' and likes things in his name, so I sent the money and he booked)  otherwise I would of cancelled it immediately, we have broken up but I'm still getting so much abuse saying its all my fault and if I had respected him and not asked questions, none of this would of happened. His mom is saying I disrespected him and his role as a man. So, AITA for questioning him?

Added info: together for 3 years, not living together. When I asked for his half of the deposit back, he sent me the full $1600 and told me it was over. I was going to end it once I had the $800 from him so he literally beat me to it by minutes. I won't tolerate abuse but I'm wondering if I was wrong.

Edit: thanks so much for the support, I've really appreciated everyone's insights and kind words. He's lost out and I've got everything to gain! Never settle for abuse. No one is ever worth it",Not the A-hole
AITA for wanting to compromise on our vacation?,"My girlfriend and I are planning a vacation to the Philippines. 
I would prefer that it is in a secluded area on the beach in a nice AirBnB with a bit of luxury like for example someone cooking for us.

I have proposed that we do half of the vacation in a place that I choose and half of it in a place that she choose. But she has said that she will not be going if any of the vacation is in a place like what I describe. 
Money should not the issue because I will be covering any premium of the place I choose in comparison to the place that she choose.

AITA for prioritizing not being late to avoid punishments?,"I, 19M am in the army. To preface, army is a regimental organisation with strict rules as most would know, so being late to things is a no go. So I always leave my home early so as to not get punishments. Just recently, my mother was going to leave home at the same time I was. She was going in a completely different place, however we were both going to the train station. 

While waiting for the bus to the train station she said I should walk slowly with her instead of going ahead. I in turn replied with ""I am rushing to see if the bus has come yet, and if it did I would not wait for you and would run to catch the bus"". She gets irrationally mad in my opinion after what I said and proceeds to make a fuss and reply with, ""You should wait for me instead, you are inconsiderate."" plus some petty insults. I reply and say that ""I take precedence being early over being late because I waited for you."" She then gets even more mad and says ""You shouldve just left earlier then."" Despite the fact that I did and have always. Keep in mind that this is a completely made-up scenario which she brought up.

TL:DR Am I the asshole for saying that I would rather be early and not wait for her to avoid getting punished, instead of waiting for her and being late and getting punished in a wholly made-up scenario?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not giving my baby daddy his child support back?,"I tried posting before but it was too long so long story short, My baby daddy got another girl pregnant (long after we have been broken up, so no issues there).

 But now she has put him on child support and its going to really cost him between the 2 of us. We get him one week on and one week off TECHNICALLY. We ""switch""on mondays. When its my week, he has no worries i have my son 100%. When its his week, i have to pick him up from school and keep him until his dad gets off work. I also keep him any time school is closed and any time he has to go home for illness or when the schoool was closed for covid which was 2 weeks at a time every time. i work from home, so its always this way. So his dad picks him up at 1830 or 1900 sometimes. ive even gone so far as to do the math. he is at school 19% of the time, with me 48% and his dad 33%..In this time I feed, bathe and put fresh clothes on my kiddo. It seems petty to say but it all costs money...like on my time his dad doesnt worry but on his time i still spend money. he says he spends that money too. ,but hes not understanding that while yes he does buy him clothes and food and everything but thats only on his time. when i buy those things its his time too and on top of that the clothes im buying and shoes, and underwear and socks are constantly disappearing to his house never to be seen again...

Now hes constantly crying about how he just got a promotion and everything he worked for is going out the window because of the additional support to the new baby and how he is going to be broke and cant afford anything and wont be able to afford his apt. knowing he had this expense, he upgraded to a bigger, more expensive apt. Also, he is moving in with his gf, so hes going to have 2 incomes. they arent going to starve. He is  very into brands and has to get our son jordan and nike everything...just went to vegas, always out spending money... so ill agree, he wont be able to ball out like he is currently but they arent going to be homeless and starving. he wants me to ""help him out"" by giving him his support back, essentially trading one kid for the other so hes still only technically paying for one kid. now, im the greedy bitch that just wants his money. which i dont agree with. 

i feel as if i owe him nothing, its not my fault he got some other woman pregnant and now has to deal with it.

AITA for going 5mph over the speed limit?,"Every time I drive my girlfriend somewhere she has a go at me the moment I'm just 1mph over the speed limit.

I was just going the same speed as the rest of the god damned traffic. I'm of the opinion that it's antisocial to go slower than the rest of the traffic. I haven't had a speeding fine in 10 years, and have a completely clean license. But she thinks I'm endangering her by going the same speed as the rest of the traffic.

AITA for telling my boyfriend I won’t move in with him unless he rehomes his dog?,"My friend has a situation so I’ve let her use my throwaway account:

I(23F) have been with my boyfriend “Mark”(24M) for nearly two years and we’re thinking in moving in together and currently in the process of discussing what that would look like for us. Now I’m a fairly messy person and I don’t need to have our place look like a model home, but Mark’s dog, “Rex”(2.5) is making me consider ending the relationship entirely unless something changes. It seems that every other time I go to Mark’s place Rex always either pees, poops, or pukes somewhere in the house. Mark also allows Rex to crawl around under the sheets, which I think is nasty considering poop often gets stuck in his fur. Last night Rex ended up pooping on the bed, then immediately crawling under the sheets, and leaving a huge shit streak all over everything while we were in it and I lost it. I told Mark that it’s nasty he continues to let this happen and he needs to be more on top of letting his dog out. He said it only happens because he “gets excited” and that he lets him out enough. I suggested using bells by the door and teaching Rex to tap them when he needs to go out but he insists those are unnecessary. By that point I had enough and gave Mark and ultimatum: I would not consider moving in with him until Rex is completely house trained or he finds a new home for him. Mark said I was being unreasonable and mean by making him choose between me and his dog. Was I out of line for this? Neither my mom or I think so. 

Info: The dog is 2.5 years and we’ve been long distance until about 3 months ago so I didn’t know about this until recently. Mark claims he takes Rex out enough but I can’t know how often as we don’t live together. 

Rex is NOT a bad dog otherwise. This is his only issue.

AITA for asking somebody why they are parking outside my house?,"I (29F) work afternoon shifts. I leave my house at the same time each weekday. Over the last 2 weeks I’ve noticed an SUV with personalised plates parked just outside my house on the kerb. (Aussie spelling). 

I’ve lived in the same house for a few years and it’s a quiet neighbourhood. This car is not one I’ve seen here before. 

It appears at around 1 - 2pm each day. It’s always running, auto lights on and there is always a brunette woman (mid 30s?) sitting inside. 

She’s well within her rights to be there. It’s a public space. But just because I’ve never seen her before and she keeps appearing and just sitting there, not visiting anybody or seeming to be leaving the vehicle… I started to feel a little weirded out. And possibly because it’s right at my house, I feel like she watches me come and go. 

(She gave me private investigator vibes, but I do have anxiety so maybe not.)

So today I had a day off and I had had enough of wondering. So, purely out of curiosity, I decided to go and speak to the woman in the car. 

As I went out there I noticed her raise her phone. (Taking a photo of me maybe?) I calmly went to her window and introduced myself to her. I mentioned that I noticed her in the area recently. I asked her if there was anything I can help with (kind of trying to be polite but find out who the heck she is). 

She got extremely defensive and started to record me on her phone. She pointed to her back seat and told me I am waking her baby up. She told me she parks her car here under the shade of the tree (many trees in my area so I’m not sure this makes sense lol). She explained that she can’t get her baby to sleep and he has severe back pain so she can’t hold the baby. 

Tbh, the windows were decently tinted but I didn’t see a baby in the back. I can’t say for sure whether there was a baby in there or not, just that I never saw/heard one. 

The woman was very well dressed in a business shirt. Didn’t really look like a struggling mother to me, but then again, maybe she just loves to dress like that. 

I questioned her casually. Like why she was not parking at her own house? I asked her if she needed any help and she took offence. It just wasn’t adding up so I was asking a few questions like that. 

She got extremely angry and said I was a judgemental person for assuming she needs help. I didn’t mean it in that way at all. I’ve had babies and totally understand how hard it can be to get them to sleep etc. 

The defensiveness was a red flag to me though. 

None of it made sense.  Maybe my anxiety and curiosity was misplaced and I should have stayed inside. I just couldn’t stand to feel watched for another second. It was driving me crazy.

AITA For wanting to choose sentimental items from mother’s estate?,"I’ve always had a bad relationship with my parents.  They abused, neglected and abandoned me when I was 19 because “they didn’t get their way” despite following all of their house rules.  They were both arrogant, entitled and narcissistic people.  The only time they paid any attention to me was when they wanted something.  They constantly said that I owed them for whatever and took credit for all of my accomplishments. My mom never told me that she loved me.  

After a long illness, my mom passed away.  I was not invited to the funeral and neither were any of my mom’s siblings or her nieces/nephews.  My sister in law bragged that she and other SILs were to pick from my mother’s extensive jewelry collection.  I helped pick out some of those jewelry pieces and some of them are sentimental from my childhood.  I was ONLY interested in sentimental pieces and didn’t care about the rest.  My father said that I could have some of her jewelry.  My SIL was in constant contact with me during the funeral weekend, EXCEPT when they were selecting jewelry.  She finally responded to me AFTER they picked through the jewelry and completed excluded me.  I did not get a choice; I was not able to select any of the sentimental pieces from my childhood.  Instead, I received broken and mismatched jewelry that I have no connection to.  I was hurt for being excluded and everything has been taken or lost.  My SIL is furious that I didn’t make my mom’s funeral about her and lied to others about what happened.

AITA for not giving my parents money for the house?,"To start off: I'm 17, and when my grandad was alive he created 3 bank accounts, 1 for each of the grandchildren (including me) over years he put money into these accounts, a set amount every year. However when he passed away money stopped going into the accounts, noting that by this point my siblings already had there money and mine was the only one still in an account, however in my grandads will he split his savings between the family which I then added to the account (this was about 2 years ago and since then no money has gone into the account except for interest). Now the thing about these accounts is that you cant access them until you are 18, which means I can't access mine until next year.

Now onto the main situation: a few months ago my dad caught the coronavirus, which he has recovered from decently, however it left him for the time being, unable to work, this means that the only income is my dad's sick pay (which is far less then his normal pay). This has caused issues with paying for the house and now my parents are struggling and there's a risk of losing the house.

Because of this my parents sat me down and talked me through the situation, then asking if they could have the money in the account my grandad made for me, as there is a way to access the account earlier it just means you lose some of the money. And although I understand the situation, I refused to give them the money as the reason my grandad made that account was to help me in the future such as when I'm living on my own, and I am honestly waiting for that money so I can move out as I don't have the best relationship with my parents, mainly my mother. And because of this like I said I refused to give them the money, however now I feel guilty, although there is other things they could try, my mom keeps on saying it will be my fault if we lose the house and I'm starting to consider to just give them the money. So I hope you have enough info to decide: Am I the Ahole?

Edit: thank you to everyone for responding, I have thought about it and I will not be giving them any money, also thanks to those offering financial advice I will definitely be looking into my rights with the account and making sure they can't access the account on their own.",Not the A-hole
AITA for berating my boyfriend about his excessive spending habit?,"***I apparently didn’t reply to the bot quick enough to keep my post up, so I’m posting this again***

Basic info: Almost a year ago, I (19F) had a talk with my boyfriend (21M) in which he asked for my opinion on if he should buy himself a new vehicle. He already had a car that was provided to him by his parents, whom he still lives with. They also require that he pays for his own phone bill and part of the WiFi bill. I was also living with my parents at the time. We both make the same hourly rate, but he works more hours that I do.

When he asked for my opinion on this, I expressed my concern that he already had a vehicle, and that he wanted to move in with me sometime soon. I told him that I strongly didn’t feel as though he needed a new vehicle.

About a week or two after we had this talk, he calls, asking me if I can transport him to a car dealership (he works at). Confused, I ask why. He tells me that he needs me to take him there so that he can pick something up. I go over to his parents’ house to pick him up, and he tells me that he has purchased a Chevrolet Silverado for about $18,500, and that his payments would be ~$600 with insurance. 

I honestly feel betrayed by this point, and tell him this. His only excuse at the time was that he wanted a truck in case we needed to transport furniture and the like. In the coming months after this, I plead with him to find a way to sell it, so that he would be free of the financial burden. 

I should also mention that he blatantly told me one time, that the truck “came into his life like I did.” 

I put (probably too much) pressure on him to do to sell it that he called me at work one day, extremely angry with me that I’m so insistent on him selling it, and yells at me. I eventually had to hang up, as I was crying in front of my coworker.

Nothing ever came of this, and he still insists on keeping his “toy.” 

Fast-forward to present: He has now bought himself a new phone simply because his old one had an issue with its microphone… for $800: around half of his savings. I’m obviously upset about this as well…

I’ve had several people tell me that I am in the wrong, and others telling me I’m in the right. I do not deny that it his own money. However, I feel as though he has shown no concern for our future, and I am tired of having to be the responsible one by comparison (I have saved over $16,000 and about to purchase my first home, with my parents’ help in covering utility setup).

So, what’s the verdict? Am I simply too concerned about his own decisions?

***Update: I had an extensive conversation with him last Saturday, and we have both come to the decision that it would be best if we just split up now. I ultimately came to this decision because he admitted that, a month ago, he traded in his truck for a Honda Civic; he hid this from me for an entire month, going so far as to sneakily avoiding taking me back to his place. I am in no way upset that he traded it in, but he blatantly hid this from me. This is the second unnecessary lie he has told. Therefore, we are over.***",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling people a woman at the gym wasn't wiping down the machines after she was done with them?,"I (M28) like to go to the gym and my gym like many others have a rule of wiping down the gym equipment after your done with it. Most everyone follows this rule, especially in this day an age. Granted my town where I live is doing better against COVID that a lot more people feel comfortable standing and sitting less than 6ft. 
Yesterday I was at the gym and while on a machine I saw this woman with her kids using one of the machines. The machine was essentially in my 45 degree view, so it's not like I was starting, after they are done with the machine they just walk away without wiping down the machine. I didn't think much of it at first since I notice some people do that. I gave a heads up to the next people who were going to use the machine. They thanked me and wiped it down themselves. Next I saw the same mother and her kids use a different machine that was still in my view, again they didn't wipe it down she I warned the person who was going to use it. He thanked me as well. I saw the mother and her kids use the machine directly in front of me and not wipe it down, that's 3 different machines. This point I was done with the machine I was using, wiped it down and then went to wipe down the machine they used. The mother saw me and got angry, because what I was doing was disrespectful to her and her daughters. She said I was calling them unsanitary/dirty by doing what I was doing. I responded by telling her the gym is a shared space and that the there are signs saying to wipe down machines when you're done with them. She called me an AH and complained to the staff about me. Nothing came of it and I wasn't kicked out.

WIBTA if I chose to go to my dream university knowing it will likely affect my younger sibling in the future,"I recently got into my dream university, I don't want to take names but it's top 5 in the world and something I worked incredibly hard towards. However it is supremely expensive and unaffordable for my parents, they're willing to take student loans to pay for it but that would require mortgaging and using the house as collateral.

My younger sibling will be applying for college in two years and with their grades and profile it is very unlikely they will get into a top school that offers financial aid. My parents have made it clear to me that they will not be able to put up the house as collateral to fund my sibling's education and student loans then look to be out of the question. My younger siblings desperately want to leave the country and will be incredibly unhappy if they won't be able to go abroad and have to study here.

I both have an offer from a top national university. Still, it really doesn't compare to my dream university and I am likely to get admission into a top college globally with financial aid that would make it very affordable and allow my parents to take out student loans for my sibling when his time comes. However, I truly don't want to go anywhere besides my dream university despite knowing that it will put stress and pressure on the family and significantly impact my sibling in a couple of years.

Edit: To add info I did not ask my parents to put the house as collateral, if I could secure a loan without that, I would take that option in a heartbeat. They offered to do this of their own volition.

EDIT: While I understand and agree with a lot of points in the comment section I want to make one thing clear. There is a very very west dominant view point here, people in other countries don't have access to sufficient education loans with collateral. We dont have the ability to take out loans on our own, or to find jobs that'll pay enough. This is often our only option to ever leave the country and we simply DO NOT GET LOANS WITHOUT COLLATERAL. Also my sister will not be left without options she can be sent to any university in our country and she wont be applying to the UK so shes gets the same deal as me for the USA, get in to a college that gives financial aid and you can go parents will fund everything else.

AITA for not paying for my stepdaughter’s tuition because she wants to be a doctor?,"My wife and I have been married for a decade. She’s a stay at home wife and we have no children of our own.

Sarah is a junior in college and pursuing a biology degree with additional courses required by medical schools. She’s had dream of being a doctor and helping people since her mom and I met. The problem is she’s not a very good student. 

She’s failed her biology 1 class and had to retake it to get a B. She really struggled in her next level biology class and finished with a C. She also got a C in her chemistry class. She got a B in calculus 1 and 2. She’s making A’s in her none science and none math classes so they’re padding her GPA which is at a 3.2. This semester I just learned she will make B’s and C’s in her science and math classes. I’m not a doctor and I don’t know any doctors but I did online research. I found out that medical schools require many things but at the top of the list they is a high GPA and top grades in science and math classes. With Sarah’s grades, she’s not getting into any medical school. I even looked into nursing school to see if I can talk her into going that route and all the ones I looked at require higher grades than what she has.

I talked with my wife about it and she said medical school looks at other things besides grades and that’s where Sarah excels. She has a solid volunteer resume and she’s cares about people. I argued none of that matters if her grades are not good enough. She argues that Sarah will do great in the interviews. Like I said, I have no experience with medical school so I can’t argue with her logic. Instead, I talked with Sarah when she came home for thanksgiving and told her to look into another major because she might not be cut out to be a doctor. She ran to her mom and we all got into a huge argument. I admit I lost my temper and yelled I’m not wasting any more money on something she’ll fail at. I told them both I’m not paying for next semester’s classes unless she changes her major to something more realistic.

I feel bad, I really do but I’m not rich and I don’t have money to waste if she doesn’t have a chance to get into medical school.

AITA?

Additional info: the reason why I want her to switch majors is that having a biology degree without any advanced degree is useless from my research. While I don’t know any doctors, I have friends who have biology degrees without other advanced degrees and they couldn’t do anything with it. One had to go back to school for another degree, one works as an assistant manager at Lowe’s, another has been a receptionist for 20 years. They all advised against getting just a biology degree. While these are all noble jobs, they didn’t need to pay for a biology degree to get those jobs.

I’m still willing to pay for her degree if she switches to something that will allow her to get a good job.",Not the A-hole
AITA for lying and hiding my plans for when i turn 16 from my mom?,"I (15M) am current living with my mom (40's F) in an abroad country since it would give me a better life in general. My dad (50's M) still lives on our native country because he has a gf (50's F) and a rare disease which would cause him way to much stress if he lived in other place.

Him and my mom have been divorced for 10+ years but they always had a 50/50 custody of me, even tho in my native country my dad is obligated to pay child support, here is where me and him feel like something is wrong because 1) both of them have the same salary, 2) the child support money would have been for a good education plus some spoils for me but it never happened, my mom would use her money to pay for my school and say that ""it's not enough"" even tho the money she got would be 3 times the price of my school, and I never got any presents if not a chocolate and very simple toy on my bday and Christmas, and every big gift I got was also paid 50/50, causing my dad to lost even more money and out of nowhere my mom always had new clothes and jewelry. 

Back in 2015 my dad tried to stop paying child support because he knew it wasn't being used for me or at least make it less, but it didn't work because there were no evidence of it. So me and my dad decided that it would be better if the money went straight to me instead of my mom. In our native country the legal age to get someone emancipated is 16, so in a few months we're planning to get me emancipated, so the money is actually used in my favor, plus I can save it for college and rent, which I wish to do in other country, where none of my relatives lives so I could have support.

My mom have no idea about this and I have no plans of telling her until the process of emancipation begins.
I think I could be the asshole because it would cause a great shock in her and because she has been relying on this money for basically all my life and I'm a bit worried that she'll have a hard time on keeping everything together.

More info because I feel like I didn't put enough:
1- No, my dad wouldn't be legally required to send me money, but if I'm emancipated that's our plan even if it's not on legal paper.
2- No, my dad and his gf are not planning this against me, I don't even think she knows about this, but my dad is not this kind of person. He supports me in anything, everything I do he's there for me if I need.
3- The child support money being used for my mom luxury has been happening since they got divorced, not just recently in another country. Even as the currency exchange is a bit expensive but there some agreements between both countries so it is way less than a normal exchange, causing basically no difference on the total money.
4- I'm young, naive and if I'm being considered an adult I should do research (which I have), I know my mom is not obligated to let me stay, I'm prepared for that and I have friends that would let me stay with them for a while, but I highly doubt I would be kicked out, my mom would probably just ask me to pay for water, light and internet or pay the equivalent rent to a room.
5- I have plenty of time to decide if I actually want to get me emancipated, right now I want it but in the future my mind would have been through a lot of changes and next to my 16 bday I will think if it is really the best for me.
6-I'm not saying that the money was never used for me, some of it was for my school as well as house expenses, but others parts of it was for truly my mom's desires, me and my dad wouldn't mind so much if it was just a little or just once in a while, but it was constantly and she used a lot of money, causing my dad to have to pay for about 40% of my school.
7- Saying that big gifts are always 50/50 because that way I wouldn't ""like one parent more than other"" in my life has never occurred, everything I ever got from a t-shirt to a smartphone have been given to me from both of them, even if it was paid for just one parent.
8- I have no idea what makes you think that I may have been manipulated by my father, I may have not expressed it well but when he presented the idea of emancipation to me, it was really and idea and not and obligation, I chose myself to agree with it, just then we researched about it and started to make a few plans.

AITA for asking for an address so I could make a decision about drop off times for my son.,My 26 year old son wanted to know if we could give him a ride to a job interview.   The time he needed to taken was between 5pm and 7pm.  My wife asked me when she should drop him off.  We already have to drop me off at an appointment at 5 and pick up another son at same time.  I asked where the location was and was told 22 minutes away.  I  said why dont you drop him off early and he can do interview at 545.  My wife then had questions about why I said 545.  I asked for address so that I could see exactly where we needed to go and was advised that I was arguing because I could not answer a simple question.  She the tossed her phone across the car so i could get the address.  I wad told I was starting a fight.  I tried to explain I just wanted to see where this was and was told again that she had already given me enough info to make a decision and it was wrong that I wanted the address.  I at this point said that if you already know what you want and won't allow me to even think about something then don't ask for my opinion.   Now we ate not even talking because she is in tears. I stopped the conversation because it started getting heated. Am I the asshole?,Not the A-hole
AITA for being sour that my bf didn’t make dinner because he apparently suddenly felt sick ?,"I’ll try to keep it short, if I miss any relevant info feel free to ask. Sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile. 

I (26F) have been feeling sick all day and didn’t sleep last night, I was feeling pretty gross and acidic in my stomach and hadn’t eaten all day because I didn’t feel like I could stomach food. I felt funny and sore in the head because of the lack of sleep, all round just felt horrible. My bf (27M) knew this. 

He hesitantly agreed to make dinner bc I made dinner the night before and I was feeling sick, initially he tried to ask me to sort dinner. I got very hungry and started feeling more sick and acidicy in the stomach because of it. The footy was due to start in 15mins and he said he would make dinner at half time. I agreed to wait, I only asked for a oven pizza not a full blown meal so it wouldn’t take long. We both enjoy the footy and don’t want to miss  any of it. 

Half time came, he went down stairs, sat on the toilet for 10mins and came back up without our dinner or our dogs dinner. Sighed in the sickest sounding voice he could muster that he suddenly felt very sick and laid down, sighed again that he forgot the food. 

I got up very frustrated and said I would just get cereal and grab the dogs dinner too. (I had been waiting an hour at this point, I just needed food in my stomach). I came back upstairs with my cereal and the dogs dinner, and sat down to eat and finish watching the footy. He had turned it off knowing that I was watching it, so I gave the dog dinner and again frustrated said I would just go back down stairs to watch the footy and eat my now soggy cereal. 

He bought 2 bags of spicy snacks beforehand knowing I can’t eat them at the best of times let alone when I’m feeling sick. Ate both bags during the first half of the footy so obviously wasn’t hungry anymore. He was literally wrestling with the dog and being loud directly before he went down stairs, then suddenly within 10mins is so unbelievably sick. If this was the first time I wouldn’t be so pissed, but too often “coincidentally “ when it’s time for him to deliver on anything we agreed on he suddenly feels sick, has a headache, or falls asleep. 

I’m pissed he made me wait so long for nothing, knowing how sick I felt. The whole reason I waited was because I didn’t feel well and didn’t want to get out of bed and stuff around with dinner. I’m even more pissed that he made me run around up and down just to feed the dog and left me no choice but to go back down stairs to watch the footy. He should of at least fed the dog. 

I feel I could possibly be the asshole, if he actually genuinely was feeling sick and I cold shouldered him and selfishly had an attitude that he didn’t put my needs first while I was feeling sick. 

So, AITA?

ETA- guys I get that based on this post alone you all think that I’m in the worlds worst relationship but that really isn’t the case. Please keep in mind that out of my 6+ year relationship, the only context you have is a shitty 1hr interaction that I wrote while angry. So, just relax on all the “leave him your future is doomed”, you really don’t have enough information for that ey? And I really didn’t ask, I asked for judgement on who was the AH on this single interaction alone. Now go right ahead and flame me some more, downvote me to oblivion, but just know you really don’t have enough information to deem my relationship as a lost cause that I should leave.",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to give up my dog for my dad’s fiancé and her son?,"I’m really upset about this right now.  I’m 17F.  My parents divorced when I was 12. It was really rough, they pretty much hate each other and still have trouble doing anything together where I’m concerned. I try not to talk about them to each other and just keep things separate.

All the fighting and chaos was hard on me and was effecting my mood and school work when it was all going down, so my dad felt bad and let me have a dog to help me feel better.  Someone nearby had malamute puppies, so I picked out one and his name is  Tycho and he’s my best friend. Even on the weeks I’m with my mom I stop by after school every day to take him to the dog park to play and get his cuddles in. I love this dog.

My dad started dating Melanie a few years ago.  I don’t really connect with her, we’re just really different and she’s way too touchy, but she makes my dad happy so whatever.  Her son Ben (9M) is autistic and needs a lot of accommodations, he gets really upset and has meltdowns when things change or are done differently.  He’s also really scared of Tycho even though as far as I know Tycho has never done anything to scare him, he’s a really laid back and well behaved dog.

Dad and Melanie recently got engaged and they want to go ahead and move her and Ben in so that they can get rid of their apartment and save money.  My dad told me about it and said that since Ben is afraid of Tycho and needs a stable environment at home, Tycho is going to have to go somewhere else. My mom’s townhouse doesn’t have room for him and my grandparents aren’t in good enough health to look after a big dog, so we would have to rehome him.

I admit I didn’t take it very well and we had a big fight.  I told him that no way was I going to give up my dog and I’m going to college next year anyway so they can put off the move until the spring when I can find a place to take him with me. My dad says they need to do the move over the holidays and Ben is more important than a dog. I told him if he gives away my dog I’ll never forgive him and that he obviously thinks Ben is more important than me, too.

My dad is mad because I’m making this a choice between me and his fiance basically, Melanie is having second thoughts about the engagement since I “don’t want to live with them”, my mom is mad at my dad and they’re fighting again, and I’m afraid to leave Tycho alone because he might not be there when I get back. My aunt says I’m being childish and my dad deserves to be happy.

AITA?

Edit - I talked to my mom and grandparents after school.  I brought Tycho to my mom’s place this afternoon and I’m going to to take him to my grandparents tomorrow.  I’m going to split time between them and my mom for awhile and my grandparents said that if I go to college nearby I can live with them while I study to make sure I don’t lose my dog.  So I’m going to look at maybe doing two years at a local college and then transferring to a university later.  I haven’t told my dad yet, but I will after I get Tycho settled tomorrow, I already went online and made sure his chip information is up to date with all my info and my mom’s as backup. Pretty sure all hell is going to break loose but honestly, I’d do almost anything to not lose my dog including just not going to college right now if that’s what I have to do.  He takes care of me so I have to take care of him.

Edit2 - It’s been a rough few days, my dad flipped his shit when I told him I wasn’t coming back to his place and he and my mom are duking it out right now. My mom’s lawyer asked me a bunch of questions and then said not to worry about it. Melanie called to find out what was going on so I told her that if living with her and Ben means I lose my dog I’m just not going to live there anymore and she tried to talk me out of it because my dad didn’t want to lose me, but I told her that’s just how it is.  I think they’re fighting now, too.  My grandparents said my dad is being totally unreasonable and he’s not allowed to come on their property.  Gonna be a fun Christmas, I’m just going to stay at my grandparents and try to keep my head down until I go back to school.  But Tycho seems to like it here, he has a lot more space to run around and still gets to sleep next to my bed, so he’s happy at least.

Final edit - Ok, last update.  So, Melanie broke it off with my dad.  My dad didn’t talk to me for awhile, but he finally asked to have lunch so my grandpa went with me because he wanted to make sure I was safe and my dad didn’t yell at me. My dad apologized for trying to make me give up Tycho and wants me to come back home.  I told him I would come visit but I’m still afraid he’ll take my dog.  Living with my grandparents has also been really nice, it’s quiet, they appreciate me helping out with the farm, and my grandma is teaching me how to cook. He wasn’t happy, but he said he understood and we worked out a plan for me to visit for dinner a few days on the weeks that used to be his weeks and I’m dropping by to see my mom most days on her weeks, but spending most of my time with my grandparents.  I got a scholarship to the local branch of the state university and it’s only an hour and some away and has the degree program I want, so I think I’m going to go there for at least the first two years.  I’m going to talk to admissions about getting a waiver from living on campus since I’m helping my grandparents. Both my parents are going to chip in on an allowance for me and Tycho while I’m in school, my mom says my grandparents can relax more and are feeling better with me there (also they love Tycho being around now too) so it’s the best option for everyone and I’ll be able to budget for vet visits and everything. My dad is still mad at my mom and Melanie, but he doesn’t want me to miss out on college and he seems to be more himself after the first week of visits.

Thank you all for the advice. I’m so relieved this has worked out, I’ve had hella anxiety over Christmas about all of this, but I get to keep Tycho, things are mending with my dad, and I’m on track for college.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I told my Dad to reduce what my Mom gets from his will?,"Long post, but there’s some background info 

My parents have been together for over 30 years. My Dad comes from a very wealthy family, and my Mom comes from nothing. Their relationship has always been rocky. (Ex: they used to be abusive towards each other, my Mom cheated early in their relationship, argued a lot, etc.). My Mom is a raging narcissist & my Dad had a history of alcoholism and substance abuse (clean for over 20 years). I (F17) am here since he wanted someone to inherit his money. I grew up watching them fight, and my goal is not to put either parent in a bad light. My parents were never married, but they’re living in separate houses (my Dad owns both).

Now to the problem, my Mom started a new job a couple of years ago where she met a guy (we’ll call him Tim). She would text with Tim outside of work when she first started to ask him about her training, but it is something different now. They are deeply in love. Also Tim has a wife and kids of his own. My Mom goes on dates with Tim, rents hotel rooms, secretly takes off work to see each other – one of my friends sent me a picture of him going inside our house when my Mom said she had a doctor’s appointment that day. There isn’t a time when she isn’t texting Tim. 

I told my Dad when everything first started (about 9 months ago) because I saw them saying they loved each other, and I felt that he deserved to know. My Dad took it very hard. He’s spent nights crying wondering why he isn’t enough, and even blatantly asked her what he could do better. However, she denies the cheating claims and always says, “We’re only friends. Dry\_Research3220 has friends that are guys, that doesn’t mean she’s sleeping with them!” 

Since then, my Dad has changed his will to give me complete ownership of both properties after he dies. Recently, my Mom had me doing something on her phone, and I admit I am an AH. I gave in and started reading her texts with Tim. I felt upset. She was talking about how once my Dad dies, they’ll never have to worry about money & she plans on having an account with both of their names so he can spend whatever he wants because “no one has ever loved her as he does.” She talked about how she was staying with my Dad for me and the money. If my parents were to split completely, my Dad would leave her with almost nothing. He told me he still wants her to have some money because she raised me.

I want to tell my Dad this information, and I have pictures. I want to tell him that she doesn’t deserve as much as she’s getting because she’s only pretending to love him to have money to do things with Tim. My Dad already gives her 3K a month for expenses, and she always yells at him, saying she doesn’t get enough. The issue with telling him is that he wouldn’t be able to be quiet about it. He’d tell my Mom, and then her wrath would fall upon me. IDK if this is important, but she’s getting around 8 mil USD. WIBTA?",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if i confronted my sister about her 2 year old in my room?,"I came back from a game at 9:30 ish. I ate fruit, played with my baby niece so my sister could eat, and headed upstairs. 

I got to my room and it felt like someone had been  in there. Well i walk toward my bed and saw my container of blue glitter was spilled. Two of my markers were left uncapped. Glitter in my crocs, towel, and none left in the container. To be fair it wasn’t that big but it’s glitter, it gets EVERYWHERE. There was streaks of the markers on our new wooden floors (done less than a month ago)

I called my mom upstairs and my sister came with. I showed them and my sister is straight “😦😬”. She said that must’ve been where he got marker on his hands cause she had to clean it off earlier.
- Would you not want to know where and with what your kid drew on themselves with??

My nephew, who’s with his dad since like 8 pm i think, has gone into my room before but he’s usually trying to play with my cat, take a cookie or two from my snacks, or just play with one of my many stuffed animals. I don’t REALLY have a problem with him in there but it happens too often.

It just makes no sense to me how he could’ve been in my room long enough to do all this and my sister NOT notice. She has a habit of being on her phone while she’s supposed to be watching her two kids and me and my mom usually take over. 

I ended up vacuuming and cleaning the marker (they’re semi-permanent so im glad they came off) while she just went back downstairs without a sorry or anything.

So WIBTA if i asked her why he was in my room alone without her knowing and if she was even watching him?

extra info:
- I have markers, paints, clay and other craft stuff because i get bored and like to explore new stuff so this is why i had my glitter and markers out. 
- my door does have a lock but its only inside and it’s the door knob that just has a little hole outside.
- my sister and her two kids (2 yr old, and 4ish month) live with us as she is the co-signer on the house but doesn’t work or pay bills. she just stays home and takes care of the kids (she was military)

edit 1: to clarify, i don’t have the supplies just laying around in the open, they’re in a big bin on my second desk. I am looking at locking door knobs online if anyone has any suggestions haha.",Not the A-hole
AITA for posting shoplifters photos on fb?,"So a couple of days ago some ladies (I guess around 30) came into the store where I work. We're a small business and Corona's been hard for us since we had to close for a while. 
We just reopened and in the first week there were 2 women who we caught shoplifting. When we confronted them, 1 threw back the clothes after we said we'd call the cops. But the other lady who she was with still had clothes in her bag that she refused to open. 
At one moment they just ran out. We sell limited edition clothes that we design ourselves so the clothes aren't replaceable. We had picturesof the ladies, 1 name and a place where 1 of them could be living. We knew those things since one of them called the other by name and the other didn't want to wear a facemask and used her hometown as an example that they didn't have to wear facemasks over there. 
Well, I pisted the pictures on FB, blurred at first with a text that they could contact us in 24 hours and if they didn't we'd post the pictures without blur. 
They got snitched by a lot of people. We got  1 of their names and I found the other girl in her friendlist. She has no profile picture but the name and hometown match with what we overheard. We also got offered information about there whereabouts like their adress but I rejected that information and told them we don't want to take it that far.

Thing is that it is not legal to post someone elses picture online. You cant get fined for it, only if you also say nasty things about them but we did not do that. 
A lot of storeowners do this since the cops don't do anything about it. But some people commented that we should be ashamed of ourselves for posting their pictures online. 

I myself think that when you steal (from a small business that already struggles) you're an AH and you should accept the consequences. But I could also see that since this isn't actually legal I could be TA cause this will ruin their reputation. am I TA here?

Edit:
We also didn't want to call the cops at first but one of the ladies (who we had proof of she had stolen) was making a big commotion and didn't want to open and show us her bag.

AITA for turning away my father and sister when they refused to accept my boundaries?,"My wife (40) and I (37) had our first child in July, and my father (73) and sister (36) drove about ten hours to visit us in early November so my sister could meet the child before we moved abroad in early December.

We were in the middle of an international move (moving a 3BR/2BA + garage) with just me, my wife and her mother (who was staying with us helping us move) packing. Not to mention our newborn.

My father and sister said they felt extremely disrespected the night they arrived to their hotel room after I told them that it was not a good time to come to the house the following day.

This was true. There were boxes absolutely everywhere and the place looked like a bomb went off.

I am sure they also felt pissed because my wife’s mom was allowed to stay with us while they were ""not allowed"" to come over.

I also told them that it wasn't a good time to come over because my wife + her mom would just be busy the entire time packing (this is true too... we were really coming down to the wire and ultimately did). Not the best environment for catching up.

Both my dad and sister KNOW how much my mother in law does for my wife and I. Dad and sister never help out.

They kept saying that they would just “be in the corner.”

However, I was to spend almost the whole day with them + baby the following day, and much more in the following two days with wife and MIL. Certainly no lack of effort seeing them from any of us (especially in light of circumstances).

Their only issue was that they wanted to come to our house.

Dad felt like it wasn’t “how it should be” that his daughter meets “her nephew” at a restaurant for the first time.

Each time I tried to POLITELY tell them (4+ times) why (per the above) it wasn’t the best time to come over, they just got stronger/angrier.

So I said, okay, you guys take care, and hung up.

Followed by their angry voicemail and text message(s) the following day. My sister’s voicemail referred to my wife and her mom as “external forces.”

After these, I texted my sister that they could go home.

I do feel really bad about how everything, I just don’t know how else I could have accommodated them beyond just, okay, come over to the house then.

The original plan was even for them to come down to the house for Thanksgiving, but my Dad changed it at nearly the last second.

My sister had about four months after baby was born to come down and to be persuaded by my dad to come down before we left.

Dad met the baby once before by himself AT OUR HOUSE in September (two months before their visit and three months before our departure).

Also don’t want a precedent where I just relent whenever they get angry enough with a boundary I set for my own family’s good.

AITA for refusing entry to someone with a service dog?,"I 15F recently opened my own small buisiness. It is basically just me cooking food and either people pick it up or for an additional fee i can deliver it. Well last week someone placed an order and chose to pick the food up. 

Long story short i made her food and when she came to pick it up i saw she had a service dog with her. I politely texted her to get back in her car because i have a severe dog allergy and even the littlest amount of fur causes my skin to swell up. She texted back asking me how i would give her her food. I suggested to triple bag it and put it outside her car on the ground. She declined and said it was gross to put food on the outside ground. I told her there was no other option since my parents weren’t home and i could put the food in a fourth bag. Then she got angry and accused me of discriminating her because of her service dog. She rode off whitout paying and left a horrible review.
I later contacted her to pay for wasting my time or i would call the police

I told this to my parents and they think I overreacted but i think im in the right

Reddit AITA?

Edit: sorry for my bad English. Im not a native speaker

Edit2
some info:
-yes it is perfectly legal to start a buisiness as minor as long as you have permission from parents

-people picking up food usually takes under a minute, they pay i give them their food and they are already headed home so the food doesn’t get cold

-i’m dutch

Update:
Thank you all for your advice. I decided to buy a little table for situations like this in the future. I also called the woman and apologized for the inconvenience and for threatening to call the police on her. She said that it wasn’t right of me to do that but she admitted she was also wrong for getting angry at me instead of helping to find a solution for the both of us. Lastly she said she would delete her bad review. She also said she wasn’t going to pay the full amount because she didn’t get food but she was willing to pay half because i still made her food and i was professional enough to apologize so that was the least she could do for me. I thanked her for being so understanding and I thought that was the end of it but she said she still wanted to try my food.

So in the end i worked it out and she liked my food and left me a 5 star review. :)

AITA for treating my bf the same as he does me,"Okay so I know it’s long and title is confusing but me (24f ) and my bf (28m) have a 11 month old together. My bf has an overnight job and gets home at 5 am 4 days a week. I on the other hand is about to start a new day job where I’m going to be gone 7-9 three days a week. Our kid wakes up between 10-11 AM everyday and doesn’t want to nap till 2-3 pm. 
Me and my bf agreed he needed to start waking with our kid to get use to it so when I start it’s not so bad. Well he hasn’t took it seriously yet and I start in a week. It’s because very overwhelming because I get up at 6 am to get in the motion of it and I start doing things around the house. 
Today though my son woke up at 9 am but my bf did not and refused to wake up. I ended up taking care of our kid on top of cleaning and laundry. It is a common occurrence for him to leave me to do everything from childcare to cleaning after telling me he will help. Well I had enough so when he woke up at 3pm and showered I handed our kid to him and told him I took medicine that I’m going to sleep it off. I made food for him and laid down. 
I slept for 30 minutes before he started having trouble with our kid and after he saw I wasn’t getting up like normally he got upset. 30 minutes before he usually left for work he yelled for me to get up and ran to the bathroom where he spend the next 30 minutes. When he got out I asked how he felt and he just huffed and said goodbye to the both of us and took off. 
And just a note leaving everything to me and sleeping till 3-4 pm happened everyday even on his days off. And yes we have had many fights about it and also it was only an hour I left them together.

Update info : so many are asking about his sleep and how he knows when the baby is awake. The baby is loud he actually told me the baby wakes him up but he immediately goes back to sleep and for his sleep he knows and agreed to the watching schedule because our kid sleep from 2-3 till 6ish and we agreed if it becomes to much for him his mom agreed to take the baby before he goes in if needed. 

Also for clarification! I would be working 3 days a week 7am till 9pm ! I realised I forgot to put if it was morning or evening",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I didn't go on family trip that I planned?,"We have the players entitled cousin now known as EC entitled partner  known as EP and entitled son ES.

We are supposed to go on a family vacation that we planned and recently started having more problems with EC and her family. 

EC just has done a  lot of disgusting things since EP came into her life and it's started to spill over on all of us. Some of the things she's done are
1. Always dishes more food to EP and ES.
2. Doesn't reprimand ES when he bullies and fights other kids.
3. Always complain about how she's so broke and doesn't have money and doesn't have family that care when we don't help her financially. 
4. Comes to our houses and will go in our fridges and eat whatever she can get there without asking who it belongs to and if she can have it. 
5. Will fart and burp infront of everyone doesn't matter if she knows them or not and excuses it with "" oh that just slipped out "" or "" it needs to come out.""
6. Suddenly gets ""sick"" when we have to clean a place that we used.
7. And the worst to me is try and tell me how to parent my kids because my 7year old daughter doesn't sleep without me ( her father and I broke up before she was born and I've never brought another man around them so I prefer that my kids sleep with me.
8. Tried to steal snacks from my 7year old for her 10 year old  son because he finished his snacks .

EC has never said no to her son and ment it. He is 10 and glued to his phone always in adult conversations. 

So here's where I might be TA. The date for the trip is coming closer and I really don't Fee like dealing with them, I'm asking WIBTA if I just didn't go on the trip? 
Edit* the only reason she could steal from 7year old and couldn't bully her into giving it freely was because I raised my kids to always set boundaries and to stick with them no matter who you deal with.",Not enough info
AITA for expecting my partner to purchase BOTH of our flights to go visit their family?,"In the last 3 months, I have had a lot of unexpected expenses. 

Had to get 4 new tires for my car ~ $875 

Had to get my car worked on at dealership 
~ $800

Emergency veterinary bill ~ $565

Dog needed leg amputated ~ $1,300

MRI ~ $650 out of pocket 

Bill from doctor visits ~ $375 **plus**  a few $80-$100 bills for visits related to MRI 

Christmas… about $1,000 (huge family + partner) 

My partner did not help me with any of the above bills I had to pay, which is fine, it was **my car, my dog, my health, etc** 

They had offered to help me with the vet bill for my dogs amputation but never actually stepped up to help, which again *is fine* 

But here’s the catch:
Their family has been begging us to visit, and I get it! They miss my partner. However, I have had a crazy past few months and just want to go on a vacation. I have been saving what money I can, so that at some point this year my partner and I can go on a nice vacation. 

I have 4 dogs, so every time I go out of town, I have to pay someone a pretty penny to help me out ~ usually around $350-$400 for a 3/4 day weekend out of town. 

I can tell my partner is frustrated that I am resistant to funding my personal expenses to visit *their family*, who btw have been aggressively demanding that we visit ASAP, and I feel like my partner should pay for their own flight + mine too, and that they should also help me pay a dog sitter to watch the dogs.

We live with my dad (elderly - I take care of him). And the plus side to that is, **neither I or my partner really having living expenses** however my dogs cost me quite a lot every month + my doctor bills keep rolling in. Partner will not step up to pay a bill at a restaurant or while we are out shopping **most of the time**

Our groceries are mostly taken care of by my dad. Partner and I make the same amount of $$ at our jobs

AITA for not wanting children to reconnect with family?,"
Shadow lurker here finally ready for my first post.....

AITA here? My children have been estranged from grandpa ( we will call them Dave)for around 6 years. The past 4-5 years have been no contact. I have always told Dave that you are welcome to call/ text/ come see the children even though we ( Dave and I) have no desire to repair our own relationship. Dave has always had my phone number in order to maintain contact with the children. 

Grandpa Dave has not reached out to his grandchildren in these past 4-5 years despite my telling him he is welcome in their lives. Nothing. When my oldest had 2 surgeries? Nothing! Not even a text! 
Now Dave is using my father as a go between to ask to FaceTime my children to reconnect. I’m suspicious here. My biggest thought is why now? After all these years why all of the sudden? All I was told is “ there are things going on that you wouldn’t understand.” 

My response was “ it’s up to the children if they ( 13 and 10) choose to talk to Dave”

The children’s responses were both “idk, why all of the sudden. Has he changed?”

Now Dave has been involved with sketchy things and people in the past. Causing him to not be stable mentally (Not because of a mental disorder, it’s due to substances....)

Am I the asshole here for not wanting them to reconnect? We have gone through this before and it always ends the same. Dave’s crazy behavior causes drama and fighting with the entire family. They call me the asshole for “keeping the children from Dave”. Then he just cuts the children out again.

I’m just tired of the cycle. It’s been lifelong between Dave and myself. Now it’s moved to Dave and the kids.

I’m not sure if I’m the asshole here because yes, Dave is family, and is going through health issues that may or may not be the end. but I want to save my children from going through the trauma of this on again off again relationship and mind games. Dave is good at getting into peoples heads....

I have to apologize if this doesn’t make sense or have enough info. I’ll happily answer any questions but I’m so.... frazzled from this that my mind is going 110mph.

AITA for not participating in the Christmas family photo?,"Myself (26M) and my fiancé (25F) did not participate in the Christmas family photo this year with my sister, brother, parents, and grandparents. For background, my older sister (28F) absolutely loves being the center of attention and makes a point to talk over or put myself and my brother(24M) down. To me it comes off as childish and insecure, but no on else seems to bat an eye as she is the family favorite. It’s mostly silly little sibling squabble stuff, but really amplified lately due to her putting her wedding ~2 months after my own. In addition, in the past few years, both myself and my sister adopted dogs. Unfortunately, my sister’s dog is very aggressive towards other dogs and so my dog is not allowed at family functions/holidays, but my sister’s dog comes to every event. The past few years, we have done a family photo and each year has been without my dog and included hers. I usually just let it go as in the end, they are just pets and not children or other family members, so no big deal. However, I suggested this year that maybe since all the pets cant be included in the family photo, we do it without the dogs. I was (surprisingly) met with an instant brick wall from my sister and she exclaimed that she does not want myself and my fiancé in the photo either if she cant have her dog in the picture. At this point I was expecting input from other family members as this seemed outrageous to me, but the solution that my parents came up with was to have 2 separate photos. One photo with the whole family, plus the dog, and minus me and my fiancé. The second photo would be with the whole family, minus the dog, and plus me and my fiancé. To my surprise, they followed through and took the first photo. My fiancé and I were offended that we were on the same level as the dog and declined to take the second photo. Without a second thought, we were asked to leave immediately and kicked out on Christmas day. My parents have since asked me to apologize as they say I disrespected the family due to a silly fight with a dog. Although I agree it was a silly fight, we found it strange how it progressed.

TL;DR - I was kicked out on Christmas for not participating the family photo due to my family wanting to include a dog instead of myself and my fiancé.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my mom not to hug me or kiss me without consent?,"A little context: I'm (M🏳️‍⚧️) 17, turning 18 this October. My mom has some mental stuff going on that she won't talk about much but she's had severe depression in the past. Had maniac episodes. And has very narcissistic behaviour? (Idk I research a lot because of a genuine interest in psychology but I'm not a doctor and it's not diagnosis, I'm just giving context of what she's like) But her new meds should've been working. Also, I am autistic and have many issues with physical touch. [I've just edited to amplify something I didn't really touch on well in the original post, including why I thought it was relevant context]

Now, onto the events: my mom has always been a lot of a hugger. She really, really focuses on physical touch as one of her main love languages.
I don't, to me the best is simply Quality Time, or Info Dump, and Acts of Service. Because everything else either my anxiety won't believe it(words of affirmation) or makes me recoil in discomfort if I'm not the one initiating it(physical touch). I have made this clear with her, multiple times.
She says everytime she tries to hug me from the back, without consent, and it makes me lean away and feel uncomfortable that I'm being selfish, and that ""well, I am your mom and I need to hug and kiss my son sometimes"" and starts crying and what I'd call playing the victim. This has been happening since I was 14.
Then, since Christmas (now April 4th), she had moved in with her partner and I had been living alone with my grandma. And this was when we started thinking her new meds were really working finally. And things have been great
But, the house they were renting was a summer house, so she now moved back here, like two days ago.
Today, literally like 30 minutes ago, it happened again and I just had enough. I lashed onto her, saying to her again, in more explicit terms than ever, that it made me uncomfortable that she was touching and hugging me without my consent, because consentless touch made me uncomfortable. She, and my grandma, told me I was being insensitive and selfish because I wasn't understanding that a mother shouldn't need consent to hug or kiss her son. And I said that she was being the insensitive, selfish and frankly disrespectful one to refuse to hug her. They called me selfish and immature, again. And she even said she has been nothing but understanding and respectful of me(which isn't true she's been very objectifying and tokenizing of my gender identity and turning on on me whenever I did something she didn't like saying I used autism as an excuse). And told me that I should ""just get over it"" because it's my mom and I really shouldn't make a big deal out of it.

Am I The A**hole for telling her she's being selfish and self-centred and for refusing to hug her whenever *she* wants to?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not sending Christmas leftovers with my BIL for his full time care takers?,"My wife (38f) and I (43m) are hosting Christmas for the first time in our new home.  Ever since I met my wife, we have always done Christmas at her mom’s house.  My wife’s brother (33m) has a psychiatric disability (had to google the proper term so I don’t get downvoted to hell) and has 24/7 care takers.  He’s been hit and miss for Christmas and we don’t know if he’s coming til the morning of.  

Every year it’s tradition to have a prime rib dinner with the family, and my MIL always buys a 6-7lb prime rib which gets devoured, so my wife and I never get to take any leftovers home.  

This year, since my wife and I are hosting, we decided to buy an 8lb prime rib so that we had enough to feed 5 people (my wife and I, MIL and her husband, and BIL), along with having enough for leftovers.  We made the usual side dishes and made just enough for everyone, but made extra mashed potatoes because I got a new ricer for Christmas that I was way too excited to use (this info is irrelevant, just wanted to brag about my awesome ricer).  

After dinner, my BIL breaks out 2 dinner plates from his backpack and starts dishing up the rest of the leftovers.  Stunned I asked him, “what cha doin bud?” To which he replies “packing up leftovers for ___ and ___” (his caretakers).  I look at my wife, she looked dumbfounded.  I look at my MIL and she quickly responds with, “don’t worry, he does this every year”.  My wife and I had no idea this was a normal arrangement, or were informed ahead of time to make extra. 

I stopped BIL and told him that the leftovers were for my wife and I, we didn’t make enough to send him home with leftovers.  BIL got upset and threw (literally) the leftover prime rib back onto the cutting board that he had loaded onto the plate (which was all of it), pouted to his mom, and then stomped off to the car for the rest of the evening.  

MIL + husband left about 20 minutes later skipping opening presents to take BIL back to his apartment.  My wife ended up getting an earful a few hours later from her mom saying that we were rude to not feed his caretakers and that they were expecting Christmas leftovers like years before.  

I fired back (she was on speaker) and told her it’s not our responsibility to feed his caretakers when we were given no heads up beforehand. Had they mentioned something, we’d have gladly bought a larger prime rib and made extra food to send home with BIL, but since nobody said anything to us, we had no idea this was “a thing” in the first place.  

MIL called my wife and I selfish AH’s and hung up the phone.  

AITA for not sending our leftovers home with BIL for his caretakers?

UPDATE: my wife and I decided that it was a left over night.  We planned on taking the left over prime rib, warming it up in gravy, and then smothering the herb infused mashed potatoes I made.  Wife opened the fridge, grabbed the prime rib, then went for the mashed potatoes and gravy, only to realize it wasn’t in the fridge.  She hollers over at me and asks if I ate them, I tell her nope.  

Long story short: she texted her mom and asked if they took the mashed potatoes and gravy and she said yep.  Her reasoning “just make more, you guys kept the prime rib so we took the mashed potatoes and gravy”.

I don’t care that they took the mashed potatoes and gravy, but the fact they didn’t ask, or say anything, is frustrating AF.",Not the A-hole
AITA for asking my wealthy father to help me out of an abusive marriage,"I (30f) am the product of a broken home. Father (60) and mother (50) divorced before I was born. Neither of them wanted kids, but my mother thought if I was a boy my father would stick around. She hated me for being a girl, and I paid for that and the fact my father left, my entire life. Subsequently, I ended up in one abusive situation after the next, just trying to get out. 

Fast forward to now. My husband (40) is mentally, emotionally, and financially abusive to me and my kid (not his). I am disabled from an accident that happened early in our marriage, and therefore can’t work. But I do make some money from side hustles, but definitely not enough to support myself. All of my money goes towards bills anyway because only half of his gets put towards anything. I am trying desperately to leave him, but it’s been impossible given my situation. 

My father is very wealthy. Like worth millions. He owns multiple properties and businesses. He also has empty guest roomS. Like 3 of them. Fully furnished with private baths. I’ve asked him twice if me and my kid could stay with him until I could get on my feet, but each time he refuses. I’m his only child, and he knows my husband is abusive to me and his grandchild. I’ve also watched him help his many step children by both offering them housing and financial support. I’ve been on my own since I was 18, and only twice have I asked for help from him. He would rather his only child be homeless or stuck in an abusive marriage, than allow me to stay with him. 

I should add that we’ve basically never had a relationship. He really never wanted kids. But in the last few years we’ve both been sort of trying to get closer. This situation makes me hate him though. Why am I straining to build a relationship with a man that just doesn’t care about my, or my child’s, well being? 

I’ve tried to talk to family about the situation in hopes that they would help talk to him for me, but they just make excuses for him and say how they wish they could help. I have no support system, and I don’t think I ever have. Am I the asshole for thinking my father should help me since he has the means? 

Adding before I forget. I have a job offer for an amazing company near the city my father lives in, so it would only be maybe 3-4 weeks before I would be able to move into my own place.

EDIT: 

*I’m not asking for any money. Just a place to stay for a few weeks so I can transition into my own place after starting this new job. 

*All 4 of his step kids have or are being supported by him. One of his step kids actually left her husband and moved in with them to do the exact same thing I’m trying to do, and they let her stay for YEARS without paying rent so she could save enough money to buy a home. 

*I’m pretty sure these decisions are being made by his current wife (#4) which seems to always be the case. The only time he ever seemed to genuinely care about me, was for the 6 months he was single before he got remarried. 

*One thing I forgot to add is that myself and my child have a trust fund from them, but I have no info on it nor do I have access. His wife just told me about it via text last year. I’d much rather borrow from that if they would allow me the option, but I’m almost afraid to ask.",Not the A-hole
AITA for installing a lock on the bathroom door after my BIL kept barging in?,"
My f25 husband's m30, brother (BIL) m33 moved in with us after his divorce few weeks ago. The problem I have is that he started barging in to the bathroom whenever I'm using it. He never knocks or anything. Another thing is that he only does this when it's me in the bathroom not his brother. I told my husband about what I'd noticed but he laughed it off and called me paranoid. It was embarrassing because his brother would see me exposed and it made me uncomfortable. My husband said he spoke to him and he apologized but did it again.


When my husband and I got married, we promised to not have locks or lock each other out of any room. So the bathroom didn't have a lock. I was really considering getting a lock and I let my husband know that if his brother walks in on me in the bathroom one more time then a lock will instantly be installed. He didn't say anything.


Well, Yesterday, BIL walked in on me showering. He knew I would be in the shower but barged in anyone claming he needed to pee. I had enough I went out and got a lock and installed it. My husband got home, saw it and blew up on me saying I voilated an agreement that I was part of"" and went against his wishes being uncomfortable with locks in the house. He demanded I remove it and *promised* and *guarenteed* that his brother won't walk in on me again but I refused. 

He's been pissed about it since then and is giving the silence treatement.


INFO I'm not close with my BIL, my husband is. I don't even talk to him that much and I barely even sat with him at any gathering before he moved in with us.





UPATDATE: So before I provide an update on this situation. It's worth noting that my BIL used to do this with the bedroom too but at least I'm not always exposed in the bedroom.


So My husband came home and I told him the lock will not be removed til his brother leaves and his reaction was to try and remove the lock himself and tell me to quit acting childishy. what I did was not shout or scream but pack a bag and go to my mom's house for the next few days or so til this gets resolved somehow. On my way out I saw my BIL in the driveway smoking. He knew what the argument between me and my husband was about but instead of stepping up to fix it he offered to take me to my mom's house saying that my husband could use some space ""from me"". This made me cry the whole uber ride to my mom's house. The reason I feel offended is because BIL tend to be hurtful when he talks about others. I did all I could to win his approval but he thinks less of me and thinks I'm childish just like my husband says.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my boyfriend that I don't wanna buy a house when I already have one,"Okay so for some context my father bought a house on January 1st, 1978. The house was built in 1957 so it's been around for a while and isn't up to code. In 1997 the ceiling caved in and my dad not able to fix it at the time decided to move out. My dad just recently told me he wanted me to have it due to him being up there in age and not having the ability to fix it (my dad being 71 me being 21 and more capable to fix it) I just found a stable job and bring in most of the money so I don't mind being the one to fix it. My dad got me power tools for Christmas and as of January 1st 2023 I am now the owner of the property (my dad wanted the date to be ironic so that's why he waited so long). I recently pitched the idea of fixing the house up to my boyfriend and his family as they worry about our finances. And they told me it is just a lost cause. Granted my dad is a car collector and most of his collection is on the property so I can see why some people wouldn't like the idea but I don't mind the cars and I can easily move them over to the lot next door (which my dad still owns). They also told me it would just be a money pit and I had no idea what I was getting into. I've been working on houses since I was 5 years old and I know how to redo the roof due to being taught at a very young age. In all I'm looking at a $10,000 - $15,000 project that's only if I wanted to add an expansion that has already been started. My boyfriend and I went over to his parents house as they wanted to speak with me and they told me that they cleaned off a section of their property to bring a mobile home in. My boyfriend had gone with them and picked out at home for $150,000 and we're planning on having it moved to their property for me and him to live in. They told us we could have their land and all we would have to do is pay off the house. I told them absolutely not due to me already owning my home and land and that I didn't want to get into any debt of any kind. My boyfriend and his parents told me that a house that didn't need to be worked on would be better as I would not need to be BURDENED with my father's misfortunes. I told them that I would continue with fixing up my house and that if my boyfriend wanted to live with his parents that's on him. Am I the a-hole?


Edit: I went ahead and changed all my banking information so my bfs folks no longer have my info. And to add to this most of the plumbing has been replaced half of the roof is done and I have enough supplies to finish the other half. My father has offered to support me financially in this build the house is a 15ft x 30ft but will be getting a extra 18ft expansion along with a basement (which will be built first then expansion over top) and the enclosed front porch will be finished here in a couple months. I have gone inside and there is little mold to be seen and not much water damage as a tarp has covered the roof since the cave in (tarp has been replaced often) house is made of brick and concrete and no visible cracking in the foundation. I will be building kitchen cabinets and other things that can and will be moved in and attached later in the meantime since it is too cold to be outside. Also hole for the basement has already been excavated. I will probably start construction up again in March unless it starts getting warmer sooner. Also I have drawn up blue prints and have made 3d models for reference so I have everything planned out.",Not the A-hole

"AITA for saying to my friend, also coworker, not to make it a habit to leave early every week?","So I have a friend that I also work with. We work at the front at a clinic and it's just us 2 that check in and out and answer phones. Both of our boyfriends are navy as well. About February, I got news mine was reenlisting and will be going to NJ so I made her and our manager aware that I would be leaving sometime in the late spring/early summer. The job is incredibly stressful and she doesn't really help with that since she gets frustrated easily. I talked to our manager due to a lot of things adding on causing stress and being at the front was taking a toll. She wanted me to stay a but longer so we made a deal that M,T and Fridays I would be at the other desk away from the front and I would help with everything minus check in and check out occasionally. 

Her bf was on a deployment for about 6-7 months and came back about a week ago. She left early to get him and left early Friday at noon to spend time with him. Which was totally fine, cause I get it, I would too. 
The week after, she moved up an appt she had so she could leave early and then told me she's leaving early again on Friday at noon. (Her hours are 7 to 4.) Before her bf was back, she would leave at 3 on Fridays every single week. 

She texted me Thursday night saying she didn't know if our manager told me that she was doing this. I said to her no, she probably would assume that you would tell me but she could've said something earlier since she saw me move all my stuff to the other desk. And to not make it a thing especially with a new girl starting next Monday.

She says I work my butt off the new girl will be fine. You took off two days so at least I'm coming in. I deserve to spend time with him. I replied saying I took off for my birthday which was Tuesday( she never told me happy bday either) and I wasn't saying she didn't deserve to spend time with him. Then she says this:

""Exactly your birthday by yourself. And you're making it seem like I should just sacrifice my time with him and focus on working 24/7 like no I get 48 hours with him without work if I wanna take extra time I will.""

I wasn't trying to say that at all, just for her to not make it a habit and that it wouldn't be really fair for the other person because they would be by themselves unless there was coverage set up in advance. 
I was pretty hurt from what she said about my birthday since my bf is also out on sea at the moment but I did spend it with a friend.

AITA for looking up someone’s criminal record?,"I (27F) know this guy for over 3 years. I relocated to his hometown for job and was introduced to him through our mutual friend. The mutual friend is my close friend who lives in the state I used to live and she’s the guy’s tax accountant where they have a good client-customer relationship but never meet in person, so whatever she knows about him is all on paper.

Being a woman living in a completely new city, I didn’t have a lot of friends or resources. He was happy to help troubleshoot my car once, and we clicked enough to prolong the communication and eventually formed a platonic/romantic relationship. We’re not officially dating because we enjoy our freedom and both of us have commitment issue, but I’d say we can be comfortable around each other.

Anyway, in the beginning phase of us hanging out, I did some research on the guy and found out his court records (all are public info if you know their name). Let’s just say he was quite troublesome, some of them he was open about and told me when the opportunity came, but there was this one (serious) record that he never disclosed. I noticed some of the white lies he told me along the way (ie: said he has never been arrested, but I know for that record he must have been arrested) to avoid getting to that story. I didn’t call him out, and figured he would tell me when he trusted me enough.
Fast forward to last week, we were having an argument and that topic came up. He asked me out of the blue if I knew about his records, and I admitted I have been aware (all of them) a long time ago. He took it pretty hard, and was in shock that I went behind his back to invade his privacy, took away his choice to tell me on his own terms. He’s also upset that I pretended I didn’t know the entire time.

Back when we started seeing each other a lot, we did a lot of hiking and overnight road trips, and I barely knew this person and was completely new to the area. I wanted to enjoy life but also needed to worry about my safety. Obviously, those records did not stop me from continue getting to know him, I proceeded the situation knowing what I was getting myself into. I did not judge him for his past mistakes, and did not use any of the info I know against him. And I thought not mentioning I knew about his records IS giving him the choice to talk about it when he’s ready.

The last time we got together was when we made the trip to see her for two weeks and it was a pretty expensive trip to take. We don’t have extra income rn and that is another pressure as to why I don’t want us going beyond our means to pay for her stay.

I knew that the wound is healing just fine but I don't know why vet wants me to go back after 14 days for check up so I had to tell my parents that if they can bring my cat there for the check up since I have this crunch time at work for days. They used one of the cages I have which is the zipper type carrier bag. Few hours later, dad came home with empty cage, casually tells me that my cat escaped from it. At first he blamed the vet for not keeping the cage closed correctly and he said he tried to look for my cat but he can't go into the houses and lots because they might blame him with the stolen chickens or be labeled as a thief. And of course I got very mad since I've been taking care of her since last year. Why is he telling me that could happen to him when all he needs to do is shout my cat's name or ask around the area and obviously NOT jump inside a random area? Because of that, both of my parents felt like ganging up on me as if it is just a small problem and told me I should be ashamed of myself as if I am the one being illogical. He also vaguely tells me where my cat went. How am I supposed to find her with that vague info when he falls asleep for more than 4 hrs in the afternoon (and it'll be night soon) right after the dispute.

Now I don't know what to do. Maybe hope for someone just call me with my number written on her collar, but she used to be a feral cat, it'll be hard to touch her and even I look around it still be hard because I will never know if she is still in the area or ran somewhere far.

Maybe IMTA, I could've just trusted my instinct that she's doing fine, and no need for the follow up check up. Now the only one that brings happiness is gone, I'm on the very edge, all the treatment they have been giving me is definitely enough.

Edit: I contacted the vet, and yes dad brought him there. Vet  also told me that the spay wounds/stitches are healing fine, just like what I expected since she was confined to a room as she was recovering for the ""maximum"" time (14 days) of the healing process. She's obviously doing just fine, checking the site everyday so healthy to be exact.

Edit: Removed some stuffs from my main post that aren't necessary to the conversation. Since the day she got lost, I have placed her litterbox and food bowl in my front porch.

Edit: Oh come on she's not considered to be an ""ill"" pet. How can she be ill and be allowed by VET to have a spay surgery?? To get the facts straight for you, that follow up check up is given to me on the same day of her surgery cuz obv they only need to check the ""incision site"".

If you're, or anyone, wondering why I didn't get the time. Of course I used all that ""14 days"" as an excuse in the work to ""observe closely"" on her even tho I was told by vet to only observe closely for ""48 HRS"". Usually every month I can only get 2.5 days off, but I was allowed to have 14 days off alright? and after that time, they needed me in the work because of crunch time, get it?, so I have no excuse anymore. couple days passed to really maximize the 14-day recovery time, so I asked my dad cuz of course I still trust my dad (cuz he's still my ""dad"") on bringing her to the vet since ""that escape problem"" had never occurred before. And it seems like my dad felt bad, so he tells me that he is still trying to look for her around the area and I do so myself. 

For now, I'll have no more input since both me and my family are sorting this thing out of who is the a-hole and doing the solutions together to find my missing cat.",Not the A-hole
AITA for calling out a dude peaking in my blinds?,"I know I'm probably not the asshole, but I want to yell in the void about this, because I still feel a little guilty. I went to the 7/11 across the street from my apartment, and on my way back, I see a guy appearing to stand on my back porch, peeking through a gap in my blinds. As I walk up he gets down, and starts looking at his phone. I ask him what's up, and he replies that he lives here. I let him know that the door he was standing in front of was my apartment. He then replies again that he lives here, and points vaguely in the direction of my bedroom. I point out that is still my apartment, and he clarifies he meant the next building over, about 20 feet from the end of the building where my bedroom is, and that he pays rent just like everyone else. I walk away, he tells me to have a blessed day, and I tell him to have one too.

I'm white, he was a a Black dude. I'm going to feel bad if he is a neighbor, and thinks he has a racist neighbor that he shares a common area with. On the other hand, we have break-ins here. Hell, someone Kool-Aid Man'ed their way through a wall in an empty garage to get into mine. If a stranger is hanging on my porch peaking through my blinds, I'm asking questions. I'm not immediately calling the police, and I did not in this case, but I am asking questions about why you need to be chilling on my back door.",Not the A-hole
AITA For Not Paying Half For Something I Didn’t Want To Do?,"Edit 2:
As I suspected I am TA. I’ll fork up my half. But I won’t be happy about it. I don’t think I’m mad at my spouse: more annoyed at the company than anything else. But next year I’ll do what I need to do.

I’m still steamed so I don’t feel like I’m unbiased enough to make a good decision. So I feel like I need some outside advice.

I don’t want to be too specific but here’s the general situation.

My spouse and I needed something done for us. Usually I take care of it and end up paying a nominal fee. 

However my spouse was insistent on using another provider. I didn’t want to go through with it but because I’m often accused of being unyielding I decided to say fine.

Well… it went worse than what I thought. And my spouse ended up paying 3x more than what my usual is.

Usually I wouldn’t think twice about paying my half. (We don’t have a joint account we just send money back and forth.) 

But… I am so upset and disgusted by what was done I just can’t in good conscience pay it. Hundreds of dollars down the drain. For something I could have done myself.

My spouse hasn’t mentioned it but I know they are expecting me to pay - probably when I cool down. But I just don’t see myself wanting to anytime soon.

So… AITA for not wanting to pay my half for a shit service?

Edit:

Since I suppose this is too vague here’s some more info: we needed taxes done. I usually use an online service but since we wanted to do joint taxes we used one of the big name companies my spouse insisted on because “they give you more money back”. We ended up paying a shit ton more and it was an awful experience.

The money we are “getting back” is about as much as I usually get doing the online service.",Not the A-hole
AITA FOR TELLING MY HUSBAND HE HAD THE RIGHT TO SAY NO TO OUR SONS TATTOO AND I DONT WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT ANYMORE,"Background. Husband (H) and I have been married for 29 happy years. Major life decisions are 2 yes, 1 no, with me generally being the no. Essentially I am the bad cop. H adamantly opposed to tattoos. I am ambivalent about them.

Son (17) (S)  wants a tattoo (needs permission). At 16, he asks me thoughts on getting a tattoo. I tell him my thoughts and ask how he will feel explaining the tattoo when he’s older; ie: it looked cool when I was 18 or here’s the story.

For the last 2 yrs S has been struggling with working hard and not achieving wat he wants. He has handled it with grace, maturity and continues to work. A month ago, he comes back to me (now 17, 18 in 4 months) and restates that he wants a tattoo. Shows me what he wants and the meaning behind it. It had to do with his journey and family and made me cry. I told him I had no problem with it, but Dad had to agree. I give H a heads up, giving him info I had,so he wont be blindsided and can prepare to say no if he wants. Only question H asks is if I saw the design in person and what my thoughts were on it. S talked to H, and  H agrees. S hires artist, pays for tattoo and schedules appointment. If H said No, I would have supported the No and S knew that.

Night before appt, H blows up at me and tells me I boxed him in and he is not in agreement with this. I tell him he could have said no and the only reason he didnt was because he didnt want to be the bad guy. I wasnt willing to be the bad guy on this issue. Plus making S wait a couple months didnt mean anything (and would affect his ability to work as a lifeguard).

TLDR: Minor son wants tattoo. I said yes. Husband said yes but really wanted to say no. H now mad at me because he was ""boxed in."" and I should have said no, so he didnt have to because I know he doesn’t like tattoos.

&#x200B;

EDITED TO ADD: B/C of character limit I doint think I was celar enough.    Before even asking, my son knew I would most likely be a yes and my husband would most likely be a no based on prior discussion of getting a tattoo.  But my husband is reasonable and if presented with a good argument/plea has been known to change his mind as have I when positions have been reversed.    My son  gave me the information first because if he couldnt convince me he had no chance at convincing his dad. He knew we both had to agree and who was gong to be the deciding vote.     He knew I would tell his dad everything that he told me.  Which I did.   My husband never said no.   He told me he would think about it and a week later when my son asked him, my husband gave permission.   My husband believes that a failure to answer means no. But I refused to say no until my husband expressed an opinion this time.  My son asked him for an answer and got a yes.  ",Not the A-hole
AITA for refusing to let my SILs son sleep in my daughters crib??,"So my 30f husbands 33m brother 34m, brothers wife / SIL 32f and their son (20 months) are planning to visit us next week and stay for the week since we live several states away and don’t get to see each other often. 

Quick background: my SIL has never been very kind to me. Some examples include her not inviting me to her wedding (my husband and I were serious then), not inviting me to her birthday (v serious then), refusing to get her hair and makeup done for my wedding (I asked her to be a bridesmaid for my husband) which btw I’m aware this is silly but every other wedding she went to that year as a bridesmaid - she got her makeup done - and at this point I was so sensitive to her that little things hurt. 

Anyway - The other week I texted my SIL asking her plans on where her son will be sleeping. She responded that her son should take my daughters (5 months) crib and she should sleep in the pack n play. I explained that this wouldn’t work for us because she just started sleep training, we just moved her to the crib from the bassinet and I don’t want to displace her from her bed while she’s still getting used to it. She responded that since her son is bigger he should obviously get the crib because the pack n play will be too small for him and since my daughter is so young that she can sleep anywhere. At this point I was already getting frustrated but I offered to buy them a travel crib (for up to 50lbs) that he can sleep in since that should alleviate the size issue. She also declined this option and said that this conversation was ridiculous since I should just give them the crib and that she’s trying to help me sleep train my daughter. 

Anyway - I again reiterated that I would prefer my daughter sleep in her own crib and suggested she look into renting a crib via babyquip and that we can split the total with them. To this she responded that that is not happening and she wanted us to pay for all the costs or just give up and give her son the crib. Anyway I told Her that the only solution cannot be her son getting my daughters crib and that very often things are her way or the Highway to which she responded maybe they shouldn’t come. 

This conversation was about 3 weeks ago and we have not spoken since. They’re supposed to come next Thursday but Im feeling so uncomfortable with the whole situation. So AITA for not giving up the crib??

Edit for context: the crib is currently in our primary bedroom. She does not sleep in her own room yet.

UPDATE: Thank you all so much for your input! You have no idea how much you’ve validated my feelings and made me feel justified in my stance. I know it’s also on me for being such a pushover and doormat all these years - I was always hoping we could become close friends but lol the feeling is very clearly not mutual. However, now she’s messed with my baby and I’m pissed tbh. I’m making my husband deal with it and told him we have the pack n play or they can figure it out. Also that she’s not allowed in our house without a proper apology. Idk if this is the best solution but baby steps? But I promise if she makes any comments re my daughters crib and using it while she’s here - my pushover days are over.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not bringing my kid to my brother’s wedding?,"My (step)brother is having a big wedding in another country this summer. It’s going to be SO FUN and our whole family is going there for the whole week before the wedding. My husband and I decided that it would be much more fun and much less stressful if we leave our 3-year-old daughter at home with my husband’s parents, who are thrilled to come visit and take care of her. We also have only ever taken ONE trip alone together since becoming parents, so we are really excited to be kid-free for a week. I called my mom today just to talk, and also mentioned we had decided not to bring our daughter on the trip. I was surprised when my mom got quiet, then changed the subject. I brought it up again and she said she’d had a really stressful week (she has - some unrelated drama with her sister and parents), and not bringing our daughter made her sad. She didn’t want to talk about it and was clearly upset and she ended the conversation. I think she may have started crying or was really upset after hanging up, because then my stepdad called me 3 times (I didn’t answer). At that point I knew it would be a big issue and I didn’t want to talk to both of them about it at the height of my mom’s emotions. So then ensues a text conversation started by my mom. She says her feelings are really hurt, this is a big family wedding and they want the whole family there, it is hurtful that this wedding “isn’t important enough” to me to bring her “only granddaughter to this family occasion”, my kid was apparently going to be one of the flower girls in the wedding and would have so much fun playing with her cousins, she would help out a lot with childcare so we can go out at night, etc. 

Some background info for context: I don’t live in the same state as my parents, but my mom is here visiting at least 1 week a month so she is very close with my daughter. She’s an amazing grandma. My daughter has brought her a lot of joy after my brother (her son) died almost 3 years ago, so there are some big emotions tied up in her relationship with her granddaughter. I’m sure she envisioned spending a lot of time with her. I think she also feels like my daughter doesn’t get to be around the rest of the family and all her little cousins enough since we live in a different state. But, we just came back from another family trip a month ago, and it was quite stressful having to plan around a toddler’s eating and sleeping schedule, hiring a babysitter in a new place, always being aware of where my kid is while she runs around and plays with her cousins, let alone the flights/travel time with a 3-year-old. And that was traveling within the USA - this would be a lot to coordinate across the globe. We’ll mostly be hanging out with my cousin and his wife who don’t have kids, and my stepbrother and his bride-to-be who don’t have kids. And we are ready to let loose and have a good time on this rare occasion we can vacation without a kid and do adult things. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for going to my GF's parents house to feed their cats at an unexpected hour and having the police called on me,"Okay, so my GF and her parents have a B&B, they rent out, 3\~ hours away from their home. They have to go there from time to time and they either bring their pet (when they are staying for long periods of time) or leave them at home (to avoid them the stress for a double trip in a short period), this last option was available only because I was there. They asked me (it's not the first time) to feed their pet while they were away whis week (they left 2 days ago and where supposed to come back sunday evening).

Keep in mind:

1- ofc I do it as a favour, not like they are paying me or whatever;2- I work full-time and on top of that I'm studying for university;3- they asked me to go there 2-3 times per day (it's a 5min walk from my house), I usually try to always do 3 or some times 4 times per day.4- what I do there is: changing their water, feeding them, I do keep them company for some time, cleaning their litters and generally speaking cleaning the mess they do.

&#x200B;

Yesterday I went there in the morning, again after launch and had planned to go again before dinner; but I suffered from a terrible migraine which left me blocked in bed till midnight. OFC I notified my GF saying that I wasn't able to go till midnight, at which point I was feeling better and decided to go there not wanting to leave the 3 cats alone for so much time. So I notified my GF and went there.

&#x200B;

I go there and it's all good until one of their neighbours (past midnight) rings at the door, pretending to know who I am and why am I there while they are away. I explain the situation trying to be discreet, not wanting to tell too much but he keps insisting, and after him insinuating shit about me being there I close the door on him saying it's none of his business. Specially because my head was still hurting a bit and he was raising his voice. Long story short he calls the police on me.

It's not like they arrived there with their guns out but they still forced me to go to the central, taking my info and not letting me go until we managed to get in touch with my GF's parents. Like 1.5 hours after they arrived, at this point it was almost 3AM and I felt like shit, with the migraine that came back.

&#x200B;

My GF's parents say that I'm the AH for what happened, for the mess with the police and for having them woken up at that hour of the night. But at the same time I know I did nothing wrong, and my GF is backing me up. But still, should I have been more diplomatic with said neighbor?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT: Okay, I'm adding some more info since I realized I didn't explained myself enough.  


1- The house is in a condo but still a pair of carages of the residents got robbed in the last period and they heavily suspect it's the act of someone from the inside (for a lot of reasons it's too long to explain). I wasn't sure the man was a neighbor (I don't know them) and even then I have no trust for the neighbors. On top of that there have been multiple cases in my city, in recent times, of people breaking in houses of residents that are away and occupying them. Our laws do not consent to forcefully evict them (or use force by yourself) and the laws can take a very long period of time (there are stories, that even made it on tv, of people that bought a house that got illegally occupied for like 10+ years). For all these reasons I really didn't felt comfortable giving out to the man too much informations, even because it wasn't my house. I just said I was there to take care of the cats, that I was my GF's fiancé and that the family was away. But then he started to ask for how long they will be gone, begane to insinuate I was up to no good and asked for my name and ID to ""see if I was telling the truth"". That's why it escalated on my closing the door on his face and telling him it's none of his business.  


2- I didn't got arrested or put in jail. Even if the police acted like AHs it's not like they were rude or anything. They took me to the station to check my story, confirm my ID was right and have a confirmation from the owners of the house. I'm pretty sure since there was no evidence of me doing something wrong they should have just checked my ID and then ask me for a statement in the next 1\~7 days (mine and my GF's parents I suppose). I gotta look into it since I'm not that expert.

3- I'm in Europe, and there was no racial factor.

4- I'll see if I can get to know in which way the neighbor reported me, if he was vague about it or there is a base for a defamation case.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my Brother If he is not mature enough to stand up for his kids needs/rights he should not have kids at all?,"Background info: my (f32) mother and brother (m36) have always been close, while my relationship with my parents was rocky at best. When my brothers GF got pregnant, my mother was super excited. While she had other grandschildren already (my daughter) and several children from my stepsisters, it was the first blood-related grandchild  that lived close. (My husband and me live 700km away from my parents)

Now, when every grandchild was born my mom announced it in social media. She was super excited to share the news, but respected everyones opinions about it and sticked to the rules everyone laid out. Her posts were always the same: ""Welcome little one, granma and gramps are so happy you are finally part of this family""

She avoided names of kids, parents, birthdates or pictures. So unless someone knew which of the 6 children of our patchwork family was expecting, there was no way to tell whose kid has just been born. 

When my nephew was born, my mother made the same post  she made the 6 times prior and my brothers wife completely freaked out. He called my mom to tell her to take down the post and told her that she was dumb and wouldn't know them well enough If she thought the post was okay. She took down the post immediately. 

My mom was devastated and didn't understand what she did wrong. She told him that she always did that and he never said anything about it before. My brother complained that she should have known that his wife doesn't like stuff like that and that she has to say sorry and hope for his wife to forgive her and that until she did that she cannot see the kid. My mom went to them and told them she was sorry that the post made them feel bad and that it was not her Intention, but that she still can't see why they didn't tell her beforehand that they so not want that for their children. 

Fast forward a few years: His wife has banned everyone of my family to see the kids. My mom has tried several more times, but she says that she has no place in her Life for horrible people who do not respect her wishes. I tried reasoning with my brother, who thinks his wife is overreacting, but refuses to let us get to know the kids. 

I told him that his kids (He had another one 2 years later) have a right to get to know his side of the family as long as they don't endanger them and that he is taking a loving grandma and grandpa away from his kids for a stupid reason. He said that he can't go against his wife because that would not be right.

I tried to mend the relationship between my parents and my brothers Family, but to no avail.
In the end i said that if he can't stand up for his kids rights then he should not have any. He told me i am the asshole to take my mothers side even though i never got along with her. I explained that he inability to be a good mother to me does not mean she is a bad person or grandparent and that it's stupid to break contact with his whole family over a post on social media, that should not have offended anyone.

AITA for Not Thanking my MIL for Chicken?,"About a week ago I went out to eat with my MIL, my husband, and my FIL. My MIL is sometimes difficult to carry a conversation with so I always try to find something that interests her to talk about. I know she likes to cook so in an attempt to make conversation, I told her that earlier that day I had roasted AN ENTIRE CHICKEN and did not know what to do with all of it. She asked me about how I cooked it and I told her. Then we went through a run down of how she would have cooked it differently. This conversation lasted about ten minutes, during I didn't say much beyond periodically interjecting with ""Wow that sounds really good, I will try it next time,"" and ""Yeah I am just really overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of chicken in my fridge rn, so I can't really think about the future right now.""

Fast forward to the next day. I come home from work, open the fridge, and what do I find next to the piles of chicken I had made the day before? AN ADDITIONAL FULL CATERING SIZED PLATTER OF CHICKEN. LEGS, BREASTS, THIGHS, WINGS....literally POUNDS of chicken. 

I called my husband over to ask exactly what the fuck was going on and he explained his mother had dropped it off that morning and asked if I wanted to give her a call to thank her for cooking for us, to which I replied ""absolutely not.""

This kicked off an argument between him and I where he called me ungrateful and I called him blind to her manipulative antics. I explained to him that just 24 hours prior I had stated to her several times that we already had too much chicken in our home, and she had verbally acknowledged that she understood this, even going so far as to criticize how said chicken was prepared. He countered that I am ""overthinking"" the situation, that it is ""just chicken"" and that his mom cannot do anything right in my eyes. We argued about this for some time and eventually had to agree call off the conversation without coming to a consensus. He is still upset that I refuse to thank her for the carcasses and now feels it will be awkward the next time we see her.

we still have not come to a resolution and now I am beginning to wonder, AITA?

Just adding a little info for context. This is the same woman who buys me clothes that are visibly too small for anyone under 15 and comments on my weight when they don’t fit, fakes illnesses when my husband has deadlines coming up and doesn’t give her enough attention, comments on my skin tone in comparison with the rest of my family, threatened to cut my husband off a week before our wedding, had me take a cab when I needed a ride to the hospital, and asks me EVERY TIME I SEE HER if im pregnant… so no it’s not just about the chicken lol.

More context: the chicken was basically unseasoned

Even more context: 

1. I promise the chicken did not go to waste. But thanks for all the advice on how to deal with it! It’s more about the principle 

2. My husband has acknowledged the general shittiness of the behaviors listed above (and and many more!) and will push back on her and defend me. But we have to pick our battles with her. This is one of the few times where he has taken her side tho, which made me wonder AITA here.",Not the A-hole

AITA for telling my wife she can no longer tell her sisters about my job?,"Some background: we’re newlyweds, both 26 and married 1.5 years. 

The issue: my wife has two sisters one of whom works as the service provider for me and my company. My wife can’t NOT tell her sister everything I tell her, including my salary, bonuses, clients, etc. This in turn gives her sister enough info to give to her company, and it creates a huge conflict of interest. 

I’ve told my wife multiple times that she can’t say these things to other people, even family, but she just says I don’t understand their relationship and that all they want to do is help. I’m sick to death of all our business slipping out and it’s gotten to the point where I now tell my own wife very little about my days. She gets mad because she thinks I don’t trust her, which is sorta true. 

We’ve been fighting a lot and her and her whole family thinks I’m in the wrong because I was a single child so I don’t understand how big close families work. They think I’m intentionally trying to isolate my wife from her sisters when all I want her to do is shut up about this one topic that could put my career in jeopardy. She says all her sisters husbands are open about their jobs and it’s normal for big families to share like this. I don’t know if she has a point or not tbh. It’s true my family is very small and I’m more reserved so I don’t know what’s normal for others. AITA?

Edit: also to add that my wife has never had a real job, she is still a student so she doesn’t understand why certain professional things can be sensitive info. She’s fixated on the idea that her sisters would just “want to help me out” so there’s no sense in not telling them everything, including how much I earn and all that.",Not the A-hole
AITA? Being impolite to a delivery driver in the early AM,"First time poster, please be gentle!

This happened this morning.

I had an appointment this morning at 6am, so I had to be up at 5am. I was in a huge rush because I slept through my first alarm, and I didn’t have any breakfast food, so I ordered food through a delivery app. I wasn’t sure if it would get accepted, but it did. 

The driver called me and told me he couldn’t walk up the stairs (I’m on the third floor) and asked if I could come downstairs  to meet him. 

For context, I’m a woman in my mid 20s. 

I went downstairs, and I saw his car down the street from my apartment building. I was starting to get nervous because, again, it was really dark outside and I’m a woman and I was nervous about going up to a car with a strange man I didn’t know. He told me he couldn’t see the buildings at all and doesn’t see the stairs and asked me to walk down the street to his car. I thought this was weird because 1) I get it being hard to see building numbers, but not being able to see stairs?? There’s street lighting and hallway lighting. 2) For safety reasons, it just seemed scary to me to walk up to a car. 

I told him to keep driving and that he could see me. He stopped the car and didn’t get out, and I had to walk up to his window to get my food, the whole time being scared of being kidnapped. No one was around. I got the food and walked away, and as I was walking away the driver yelled “I never would’ve found you!” And I just kept walking without responding. 

I still tipped him, but I wasn’t very polite and afterwards told my roommate, who told me I was being paranoid and that I was TA for even ordering that early and then being annoyed when the driver didn’t want to come to the apartment. The way I see it, he didn’t have to accept the order. And if he really cannot see stairs in the dark with hallway lighting, he shouldn’t be driving in the dark regardless. She says I should’ve been grateful he even came that early and the fact that I didn’t tip above 20% was rude. I think that it was rude of the driver to ask a woman to walk up to a stranger’s car, especially when I’m already paying $10 delivery fee and then 20% tip.  

Hopefully this was enough info, I may have left stuff out so ask any questions if needed! What does everyone think?",Not the A-hole
AITA for sneaking out of the restaurant after my fiance told me to pay for his and his friends meal?,"


I (F33) have been engaged to my fiance (M37) for 5 months. We don't share finance because that's what he wants. I got a raise on my salary. now I earn 30% more than he does and I noticed that he's been using this to ask me to pay for him and his friends. Whenever I say ""no"" or ""why should I pay for this?"" he'd respond with ""the 30% that's why"". he acts as if the 30% is unfair or that I'm not dserveing of it.


Several times he has tricked me to pay for his and his friend's meals by asking me publicly. Let me say that I'm too nice to say ""no"", I hate confrontation especially when we're at a public place like a restaurant so I just grin and pay.


Last tuesday, he asked me to join him and his buddies for dinner. I told him from the start I wasn't paying for their food and he shouldn't expect me to. He said he ""got this"" and ""no worries"".


We got to the restaurant. Met his friends, ordered food. And in the middle of the meal he leaned in and whispered that I would be paying for everything he and his friends ordered. I got so mad I whispered back ""noooo"" but he probably relied on me not causing a scene in public and infront of his friends. he said ""you have enough money you could pay for everyone's food, 30% remember?"".


I was fuming inside. instead of reacting negatively and losing my temper. I waited til the bills arrived (they were already split from the start when we first ordered) I paid for mine then I excused myself to the restroom. I then sneaked out from there, got into my car and went home.


I started getting phonecalls from my fiance then texts asking where I was. I texted back saying I didn't appreciate how he put me in this situation and basically tricking me into paying for his and his friends food. I told him I went home then stopped replying. An hour later he came and started yelling at me calling me selfish, irrational, cheapskate and childish for sneaking out like that and leaving him stuck with a bill he could not pay (He had to call his brother for help). We had a loud argument then he walked out.

His friends didn't speak to me on this but he told me they're disappointed in my behavior and are telling him to take time and ""reflect"" on the type of woman he's gonna be married to.

AITA for what I did? Is what he's expecting from me fair or justified?.

ETA: Some info:

(1) he said that because the restaurant wasn't expensive then I could have just paid.

(2) He admitted not telling me about it til later knowing I'd refuse. He still thinks my reaction was childish and unacceptable.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I asked my sister and her boyfriend to pay more in rent?,"My younger sister (25F), my fiancée, and I moved in together last year and we recently resigned our lease for another 15 months.

Some background info: my fiancée and I moved in with my sister because she had broken up with her boyfriend and couldn’t afford to live by herself. We rented a house together with the understanding that my fiancée and I would pay 75% of the rent plus utilities and internet and my sister would pay the other 25% of the rent.

In August, my sister met a guy and they started dating. From August until October, my sister spent almost every night at his place while continuing to pay rent to us. But then his lease was up, and he moved back in with his family. 

At the end of November, he started spending some nights here. Then it was every night. And then in February my sister asked if we’d be okay if she gave him a key to the house. We asked if he was living here now and she said yes. There wasn’t really any discussion or asking us whether that’d be okay, but it’s not a huge deal. We like him well enough. 

But then she told us that he gives her half of what she pays in rent to stay here. So now my fiancée and I are paying 75% of the rent plus utilities and internet, and my sister and her boyfriend together are paying the other 25% of the rent.

WIBTA if we asked my sister and her boyfriend to split rent with us 50/50 now that there’s two of them living here? It would make things easier on my fiancée and I financially, but I’m worried that it would put my sister in an uncomfortable financial spot or make things awkward between her and her boyfriend since I’m not sure what if anything they discussed about him paying rent while he’s living here with us.",Not the A-hole
AITA For needing to move in with my Great-Grandma?,"So I (F17) need to move in with my great grandmother(F70's?). My family has always been close. Well mostly. My great grandma and mother(F36) don't get along all that well. Their civil because she is our landlord. But we had out house fire A while back and we lost everything (I promise this is important info). And we had to move away from the area I've lived in all my life. Well we got the opportunity to move back into our old trailer as the people who moved in after we moved next door as we had needed more space. Well now theirs a total of 6 people moved into a 3 bedroom place. One room is my parents room, another is my sisters room and I'm currently staying in a room with my little siblings(Toddlers 2 and 4), luckily The eldest of the toddlers has a bed that's large enough for us to share. But the whole plan was for me to move into either a trailer or to build a room onto the trailer with permission from my great grandma. But she had told me privately that she really didn't want to do that and had offered me a room into a trailer set on the land that the old house had burnt down on. It has 3 rooms and is a used trailer. But she had bought it so she could move away from the town Nearby. Now as I said my mother and my great grandma don't get along. My step father has no issue with me moving and I've mentioned several times throughout the 3 months about moving in with her. My mother apparently didn't know until 2 days ago where my grandma had told her in a comment.  And today I got stressed out and we started fighting as me and my mother don't have the best relationship. And she mentioned that she was going to cut me off completely from all of my siblings and herself if I moved in with her. Which then I tried to explain that I couldn't stay here. And we kept fighting. This is on going and I need to know, AITA for needing to move so I have a room and space to myself? (I have not had a room to myself until I was 13 if it matters and had always shared with my sister (F14).)

Edit: So me and my mother have talked it out when we were in a calmer mood. She explained even tho she’s not happy about it she’s kinda ok with it. She told me she would never be ready for me to leave the house. And it felt like she was giving me to my great grandmother. We’re better now but we are working on a way telling my little toddler sibling (the 4yo) sense he’s attached to me at the hip. But we’re working on it.",Not the A-hole
AITA for listening to music in my apartment?," So today I decided to listen to some music to hype up for my day because I have a lot of stuff to do. I live in a 5-story flat building at the 1st floor. The building is relatively new, so there has been a lot of drills.
 I am talking about drilling in between quiet hours and in late evenings (about 8-9 PM), this lasted about 3 months coming from the apartment above mine. To this I didn't call the police because I understood the situation of the building being new and people renovating. 
 While minding my on business I suddenly hear the bell ring. I already knew that the only neighbour I have has come to argue about my music, but the thing is the TV is only at 20% volume that puts out inside MY apartment about 75db measured! I argued with him about the power drilling and his response was ""You can drill as well"". 

P.S. I'm not listening to some loud rock or EDM it's reggae-rap


I really want to read your opinions.

EDIT 1: Time was 11-11:30 AM.

EDIT 2: I didn't even know he moved in. It's the first time ever that I listen to music to 20%, or I do something loud. He didn't ask me nicely he came ready to argue. I am an understanding person if he would've asked nicely I would've turned it down nicely.

EDIT 3: By ""renovate"" I mean finishing the apartment. Meaning going from grey walls to liveable space.

AITA for what I said to my boyfriend?,"This will take a little bit of context before I get into the conversation where I might be TA.

My (22F) boyfriend (26m) have a toddler who is 18 months old. Earlier today I was cleaning and mopping the house while my boyfriend was letting out dogs out. 

The weather is currently awful, so that is a task in itself with two big dogs, freezing pouring rain, and a toddler trying to run out the door. 

Our child was getting frustrated with their father because dad was blocking the door so they couldn't go outside. They understandably threw a fit because they wanted outside and dad wouldn't let it happen. Toddler tantrums are normal and the yelling/whining that comes with it. 

But my boyfriend damn near yelled in the baby's face, mocking the noise our baby was making and scared the absolute shit out of them. I've never seen my toddler cry like that or react that way, even when they were scared or hurt. It infuriated me, it's the first time this has happened. 

We've had conversations before about the parenting style that we think would work best for us and our child, and had conversations about if we're overwhelmed and asking for help.

I cool off and a couple hours later try to have a conversation with my boyfriend about the situation, which ended up getting heated on both ends. 

I make a comment (pertaining to what we were talking about) about how I wouldn't feel comfortable with my boyfriend being a stay at home dad because I really think he doesn't have the patience after the way he reacted today, and that it would make me worry about how their day went while I was at work. I told him it broke my heart how scared our baby was after he basically screamed in their face. And he just said ""F. You"" multiple times, like what I said hurt, but I truly didn't mean to hurt his feelings. 

Maybe my delivery wasn't the best, I wasn't trying to insult his parenting and I tried to explain that. Some people aren't cut out to be with kids 24/7 and I told him it's absolutely, 100% perfectly okay. But he shouldn't try to attack me when we're trying to talk about (imo) very important things.

Personally, I feel like he was in the wrong for his reaction to our child's outburst, that's not what I'm asking. 

Am I the asshole for saying my boyfriend wouldn't be a good stay at home dad?",Not the A-hole
AITA for ignoring my parents after they verbally and emotionally insult me?,"Just gonna try to be as objective as possible. 

A summary of what happened yesterday was that i applied for a warehouse job to earn enough money to cover myself financially and to “teach” myself humility in finances. The application process required my ic so i showed it to the interviewer over video call while covering my nric. I have done my research on the company to ensure it wasn’t a scam. 

My father was extremely doubtful when i was telling him how i applied using my ic and immediately asked (in an accusing tone) whether i even checked for scam business. He then went on to ask me if i even thought about how nowadays everything could be a scam and in his words “do you even know it could be a scam? did you even bother doing research?“ I tried to explain that i covered the important details but he kept cutting across me and saying “you think you’re so big and you know everything now?”

I will add here that i am a 20M and all my life I have been belittled for every action i have done in a condescending tone and while my mother agrees she always makes me apologise. Also a little background info is that i have been belittled many times before on “not knowing how hard it is to earn money” which is why i took this job. 

Anyway i lost my cool and in a raised angry tone i asked him “i’ve done my research do you think i’m that stupid?” and i would have gone on to say more but he yelled “yea maybe you are”. 

A day passed and i have decided that i’m so sick of being talked down to so i am adamant on not apologizing first. My mother has called me sensitive and insisted that getting called stupid is something i should just brush off and i should apologise first because he is my father. When i mentioned that i was obviously hurt because it is my own father calling me stupid she claims that he never used the word stupid so she has no idea why i shouldn’t apologise first. 

I am confused whether or not i am being emotionally gaslighted and manipulated because this is the first time in so many years that i’ve decided to stand my ground and my parents are just absolutely stubborn about me being in the wrong.

AITA for asking my ex-bestfriend/current roommate to move out?,"(Sorry for the long read but I feel the info is crucial) 
I (F20) and “Julia” (F21) have been best friends since high school. We graduated during the pandemic & always talked about moving in with each other, as we though we would work really well together. Well, for context I have (had?) another best friend (M20) who I have known since 1st grade. Beyond a silly crush in 5th grade that we didn’t discover til years later, there are only platonic feelings there. We didn’t hang out a whole lot but he would sometimes sleepover on the couch (prior to moving out). 
Anyways, In August I introduced them finally because I figured they’d meet at some point sooner or later. As you imagine, they hit it off so well and start to fall in love. I was a little bothered at first only because they kept if from me, as if I couldn’t already tell. Anyways, he’s coming over very frequently. Normally I wouldn’t mind but I felt truly left out, like my friendship wasn’t a priority to them anymore. But, mainly uncomfortable with a man in the house and I can’t be myself. Or don’t want to intrude if they’re on the couch, etc etc… (he sleeps over anywhere from 3-5 nights a week, and then she’ll go to his house).

More Context: my parents are wealthy and have blessed me and I’m very grateful for them!! They purchased the townhome we live in and we pay them rent. The initial deal was she would pay $500, and me nothing since I am in school, working, etc. she was going to back out so I offered to split it 50/50, $250 each. . . 

As time goes on, I start to regret to offer her this. But I never set an end date so I can’t be upset, but she is telling me she doesn’t have enough to pay full. Then this week, she buys a car. Has panic attack about the cost increase. In my head, she did have the money that whole time and her current car is fine. 

We’ve had many disagreements and petty fights over the last 6 months. Every time it gets swept under the rug or never changes. 

AITA for finally reaching my boiling point with her and telling her our living situation isn’t working? I am giving her 45 days.

[EDIT] per comments suggesting I be flexible with 45 days due to the economy, I’m definitely empathetic and willing. During our times of disagreement she has been seriously petty and frankly, a bitch, at some points, which is serious odd behavior over the course of our friendship. 
Do I miss hanging out with my two bestfriends individually? Yes, then maybe I am a bit jealous and sad they spend all their time together. I’m happy they have each other though. But I deserve to be happy as well, and he plays a smaller part of my unhappiness than her attitude towards me. 
And I’ve given her several opportunities for her to fix her attitude and for us to collaborate better, but all seemed to go in one ear and out the other. I’m not perfect either, I know I have shortcomings, but I truly tried to save our friendship before even considering $$ being an issue.

[Edit 2] Her boyfriend is sleeping over again tonight too, but they did leave and come back after I told her. I can’t help but feel she just has no self-awareness he is overstaying his welcome! Doesn’t pay for groceries, doesn’t pay utilities (they shower a lot). But It’s her first love, there’s a mist over her. Still annoyed though, bc I know him too but I feel she gets more possessive of him when I try to talk to him…? Idk. Maybe I’m overthinking.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not watching my nieces and nephews during New Years dinner?,"So my husband and I went over to my SIL for New Years dinner. There were about 20 people over for dinner, half of whom were children. We are the only couple there that have no children. 

When it came time for dinner, the smaller children eat first, and then they slowly made their way to the living room to go play so that the adults could eat.

When it came down to the adults turn and everyone went to sit, my husband and I were told that there was not enough room at the table, so to sit in the living room to eat just us two.*ouch but whatever, this isn't new behavior from them.

This brings me to where I'm wondering if I might be in the wrong 

When the kids were playing, they got into an argument. It wasn't that big of a deal, and I was eating. I figured I'd let it play out to see if it resolved itself, but one of the kids went running to the kitchen to cry to their parent and causing a disruption. Other SIL got up from the kitchen to come talk to her kid and gave me a stank eye. 

So, AITA for not stopping an argument between my nieces and nephews in the living room while I was having my dinner, that led to the main dinner party being interrupted?



INFO: People are asking why we go here.
We moved very very far away from my family and friends to be here with his family. We have no where else to go, and I'll be honest, my SIL is an amazing cook, and New Years dinner is her thing 👌 can't miss it.

Edit 2: hey guys! I just want to clarify, I know they're the AH to expect us to basically babysit. We don't mind at all sitting with the kids. The question I was trying to ask was if I was the AH for not stopping the argument since I was already there instead of just letting it play out (there was no violence, was hoping they would resolve it between cousins.)

I understand the side of people telling me to just not participate in holidays anymore. We have put up boundaries over the last few years, and being sat in the living room will not be a reason to not participate in holidays for us since we do it for the nieces and nephews! The food is just a bonus!

Thank you to everyone who replied!

Edit 3: Hey friends, I appreciate(?) you guys saying I have no self-respect for going to these events just for food. I'd like to make something very clear: we are there to be present in the lives of our nieces and nephews. We will continue to go so we can be the present aunt and uncle who love them unconditionally, even when their parents are 10000% AH.

AITA for getting upset at my girlfriend because she didn’t allow me to explain my feelings completely?,"Some context on this:
This had been my first real relationship that started out online. We are both heavily mentally ill and constantly have therapy on both sides. Both of us were clear about what problems we had and what are limits were. She had bipolar, BPD, and autism. I have genetically been predisposed to anxiety and depression and have been called emotionless due to my inability to articulate how I feel.

In the past, several people who I valued as friends had hurt me in several ways, especially after I shared my internal feelings with them. As such, I have become more emotionally distant and try to separate my inner emotions from my personal life. My mother was also not a good go-to source. She also had depression, anxiety, and OCD and would constantly be critical of what I thought, especially during my derealization. She was supportive, but it still made me anxious.

I usually try and listen to my friends’ problems because I know how it feels to want someone to talk to, and my girlfriend had needed just that. I was happy to listen, even if I couldn’t understand or fix her problems (which was a different issue). A month passes by as I listen to her, and I decided to finally open up to her. The last time I opened up to someone, they manipulated me and then accused me of several things I didn’t do, so I felt very anxious about it.

Eventually, we start talking about my harder to articulate problem: death. My views on death are extremely abstract and also rely on my issues of derealization and sometimes feeling that everything around me is fake. I start explaining this to her, but she chimes in saying it doesn’t matter what I believe because when I die, I won’t even realize it. I told her that I understood this, but it still gave me anxiety. She argued about why I shouldn’t be scared, and I kept failing to explain why I was actually have problems. I just couldn’t put it into words. After a while, I just told her we can talk about it later and to forget about it right now. She had gotten upset with me and hung up the phone. I went home and thought about how I probably fucked up until she texted me back hours later saying she wasn’t capable of helping me. She said she loved me, but she feels as if her emotional state will only worsen mine. She had officially broken up with me. Of course, I was upset. I told her that all I wanted was someone to finally listen to me and not judge me and that it just took me a while to open up to people. She eventually stated that I set my standards too high, looking for a girl who was perfect in any way and giving me the emotional security I needed. I disagreed but whatever.

Afterwards, I tried to still be friends with her, but she is still short with me and avoids anytime I try to interact with her. I go to bed every night wondering if I was the asshole…

AITA for losing it with someone for not being respectful to very high officials,"So I have this friend, Carl, (I’m not saying ages because it’s not so important) he has this group of friends, olive, Ellie and Ethan. I’m not the fondest of them but I don’t mind them (if that makes sense)

So last week we were all invited to what was essentially a very privileged weekend. First it was a whole day at our community leader’s house for breakfast/lunch/dinner. This is a weekly event where some local politicians are invited and etc…

The dress code is smart casual… olive came wearing ripped jeans and a crop top when everyone else was wearing fancy, smart clothes. After Ellie just happened to have a spare change of clothes, we forced olive to change.

She took quite a while and when we went to go check on her, her eyes were blood red and she reaked of “skunk”… we obviously were pissed because she was making a major fool of herself.

We were able to try make her look somewhat sober and respectful. I wish it did end there…

We were then invited by the UAE ambassador’s daughter for a hang (she was at the community leader’s house and was the same age as us) she gave strict instructions to come sober and be respectful.

We went to our respective homes and all started getting ready and they all went to Ethan’s house except for Carl who lives quite a distance away so he got ready at my house.

I went to go fetch them. Olive was high as a kite and stunk so bad of alcohol and she justified it with “because they’re Muslim, there won’t be alcohol there”

My car doesn’t have the best lights and the house was quite a distance away. I had to deal with Olive randomly screaming and turning on the light inside, etc.

The driveway for this house was quite narrow so you have to focus. Long story short, she started screaming and it frightened me and I went into the wall. I had enough and lost my cool and told her that I wouldn’t give her a lift back home and will make sure she’s removed from the premises and will have to walk home.

"AITA because I told my ex he's only an ""ex stepdad""","  For context,  my oldest son (21) isn't the biological son of my ex. He is the only father my son had known.  That's why my ex was the first phone call I made after I was told my son was riding his bike and he was hit by a car. We all met at the hospital. 
  We weren't given info at first. I waited with my youngest son and my ex and his wife.  They allowed one person back.  He was still in the trauma room covered in blood and other bodily fluids attributed to a brain injury.  I knew the next hour would determine whether he even pulled through.  I stayed with my son for 10 minutes and I left so my ex could see him in case the worst happened.  
    My mother waited with me and my youngest son so they could also see him.
     We waited for an hour without a word.  When my ex and his wife came in,  they started telling me what the doctors were saying and then informed me that they'd ""cleaned him up."" I was livid. I don't like getting info like that second hand.  Not to mention that mom and my other son hadn't seen him.  
      Part of it was selfish.  Part of it was sheer terror. All of it was true. 
      Without going into details,  my oldest son's father was a danger to him so I fought and won a complete termination of parental rights.  I'm the next of kin and speaking to my ex was a violation of HIPPA. 
       I pulled my ex aside and told him that I didn't appreciate his speaking to the doctors because much is lost in translation.  He looked at me like I have a 3rd eye.  He basically said he will do what he wants.  At this point I decided that while our relationship is generally good, it wouldn't be at this moment.  He refused to cooperate 
      After 4 hours of intense emotions, I was done.  My ex won't drop anything. 
      The next 3 days went like this until I'd had enough of mom and I being forced out of my son's room so the new wife's family could visit. They were to text when they were done so we could visit. 
      He forgot.  When I heard that I was pissed. My son was by himself for 3 hours and we tried to have someone there all the time. 
      At that time,  I  asked them to stay home the next morning.  His wife hung up the phone.  
    I was done.  I sent an email explaining that legally he wasn't entitled to my son's medical info.  He had no standing to make decisions.  He called me a liar and I informed him he is nothing more than an ""ex step dad"" and his wife has no standing. 
      So, AITA for firmly explaining to my ex that he's only an ex step dad?

**I did notify the hospital.  I can understand getting lost in the trauma room. Not beyond that. 

**My ex isn't ""bad"" and I like his wife better than him most days. High stress situations aren't good for either of them. Until this year,  they came over on Christmas Eve and hung out here.  Sometimes they're here for the Super Bowl

AITA for waiting to tell my detail-oriented fiancé news until I had all the info?,"Hello! Longtime listener, first time caller. 

I (29m) work a property management job that I hate. I have to evict people and we’re in the midst of a pandemic. It’s really soul destroying. 

I got a message from an old friend that offered me a job once he purchased a new business to oversee two similar stores and run them how I see fit. This would still be considered a small business and, as previously referenced, we are in the middle of hard times. I wanted to make sure that I had some concrete evidence that this was a secure move before I brought it to my fiancée’s (29f) attention, so I asked for profit and loss reports to ascertain if this was a good idea. 

Turns out the second store net $100k last year in a pretty small town and their sales etc. are doing well this year, in spite of the chaos. At this point I felt comfortable enough to at least put it on my fiancé’s radar. My best friend, my fiancé and I went to a nice dinner last night and I brought it up. She was PISSED. She said that if something like that happened to her, she’d have “called me same day on her lunch break, this just makes her feel like I keep stuff from her” and all this stuff. 

We have a pretty rigid schedule with our budget as we are trying to buy our first home by the end of next year. This job change would further advance those goals, but knowing how she is about details and thorough questions, I elected to wait until I had enough info to give her and she was not pleased.

Me (21M) and my parents have had quite the rocky relationship for as long as i can remember. I can be quite stubborn, a trait I inherited from the both of them. My dad has a contracters and real estate firm where i have been working since i was 13. I spent all of my vacations working at the firm even when they are on holifay ( they do always ask me to come with them). 

The problem I’m having isn’t that my girlfriend (19F) isnt allowed to sleep at mine ( their house their rules) but that I am also not allowed to sleep at my girlfriends except for on the weekends. This would be fine by me because this is the way it always was with my previous relationships but my girlfriend works in a nightclub on friday and saterday night. On weekdays I work on school and in the evening I work at the firm. So the only times I can see my girlfriend is on sunday when she is sleeping most of the day. 

Me and my parents got in a huge fight yesterday where they said : “Sunday is more then enough you dont need to sleep there” the fight continued and i just shut myself of from it because fights are mostly them expressing what they think and me having to abide by that.

AITA for walking out of my baby shower after MIL denied me food?,"Before I start I'd like to say that I'm a bit of a big girl. No shame in that, I love myself just the way I am and I have been living by the motto ""be you, everybody else's taken"" 😅.

MIL (DH's mom) always made comments about my weight, eversince I got pregnant, she started making more comments while low key shaming me for what I eat.


Whenever I visit, she'd give me smaller plate, portion, cup even spoons. She also buys me ""small size"" clothes even though I'm in my 2nd trimester and those clothes don't fit.


My SIL decided to throw me a baby shower after my DH denied when my sister offered to throw me one. The whole side of my inlaws are invited. Mom refused to come after what DH said to my sister (another story for later).


I got there and MIL was in charge of serving food to the guests. All that was served was cakes and juice. I got hungry from talking and I got up to eat some cake. The second I put my hand on the cake. MIL grabbed my arm and said that I'd gained enough weight already and that if ""I keep this"" up her son will not be happy living with ""a large Walrus"". I was shocked I didn't know how to react especially since she said this out loud. She looked at me in a ""sorry-not-sorry"" kind of way. I put the cake down and grabbed my stuff and started walking. Her daughter stopped me saying I can't leave mid party and embarrass her like that. I told her to tell her mom to leave if she wanted me to stay but she went off and said ""Are you crazy? She's my mom! you want me to kick her out infront of everybody?"". I turned around and kept walking. I called mom to come pick me up and went home.


DH came home looking furious. He asked me to explain what I did at the baby shower and why. I mentioned what his mom did and he started ranting about how I fucked this up over something so minor. I told him it wasn't minor in my opinion since she literally cut me off food and didn't let me eat when I was hungry. He said that his mom meant well and that I needed to get rid of this ""easily offended"" mindset immedietly before I pass it down to our son. He said that cakes are essential foods, and that this was not a good enough reason to walk out the baby shower that his mom and sister put a ton of money, time and effort into. He said that I had hours to call and fix things up but I refused. I went to stay with my mom because he wouldn't stop pressuting me to call and apologize for what happened.

He kept talking about how pissed and let down his mom and sister feel and called me ungrateful and spiteful for doing what I did.


Am I overreacting here?


More info: Lot of of you asked what my DH said to my sister and what was the argument about.

The answer is, My sister is infertile. has been for years. DH claimed that she's becone ""obssessed"" with the baby simply just because she bought me stuff for the baby as gifts and wanted to throw me a baby shower. My sister is a great person and I have no doubt that she only did all that just because of how great she is/will be as an aunt. My DH kepts insisting there was ""something wrong"" with her which led to a fight between them and he ended up calling her ""possessive b&/$^"". My mom kicked him out and my sister cut contact with him. The issue got worse with my BIL (her husband) arguing with DH as well.",Not the A-hole
AITA for not supporting my sister's stillbirth charity?,"  

Background info: I (34f) have never had a great relationship with my older sister (36f) but we are civil. She lives near and has a close relationship with our mom. I live in a different country. I am very-low-contact with our mom due to child trauma (I've had extensive therapy.)

I gave birth to a stillborn baby girl in 2017 at 35.5 weeks. It was terrifying and traumatising and, for anyone else who has been in this boat, I highly recommend the charity Sands.

My family were not very supportive. I get it: baby death makes people weird.

My daughter’s death took a huge toll on my mental health. I mention this because I feel it contributes to my anxiety about being TA.

In 2019 my sister became pregnant with a baby girl. I was happy for her and excited to become an Aunt. I also had a lot of difficult feelings. My sister has always managed to outshine me, and I still carry some of that insecurity. It was irrational to think she got pregnant to spite me, but my grief-addled brain was not rational. I expressed to my sister and mom that I was struggling a bit and that although I was overjoyed, I may occasionally need to go “offline” for a couple days to tend to my emotions.

My mom blanked me for several days before saying she was “disappointed” the new baby wasn’t bringing my sister and I closer. She “couldn’t understand why I couldn’t just be happy” and she “wasn’t going to stop posting happy things just because I was upset.”

My sister also didn’t understand. She accused me of being jealous. Both her and my mom, on a few occasions, said, “you lost a daughter but we lost a niece”, which I took to mean that they also suffered a terrible loss but were handling it better than I was.

I felt angry and misunderstood by their reactions. We all argued to the point where we stopped talking to each other. I wasn’t there for my sister during her pregnancy or for the first six months of my niece’s life. I take full responsibility for this. I was hurt and couldn’t process that enough to remember my role as an Aunt. My sister and I eventually patched things together, albeit shakily. She has a healthy baby girl and I try to be a good Aunt from afar!

Six months ago my sister said she started a Stillbirth Charity and asked me to write about my experience for the website. I felt uncomfortable and took several days to think. Eventually I wrote her back and said I didn’t feel comfortable writing my story because so much of my experience was tainted by our family’s reactions, including hers. She got angry and asked whether I would write my story if it wasn’t her asking. She said it was “unfortunate” that I wouldn’t support her. I told her that I felt like I was in a good place and didn’t want to open it all back up again. Our communication has deteriorated since.

AITA For telling a woman she can’t change her baby’s dirty nappy on our cafe’s chairs?,"Background Info:

So the building where the cafe that I work at is located in, was built in the 1750’s and is therefore a listed building. Because if that, we cannot knock down walls so we are tight on space. 

A consequence of that is that we only have enough space for one women’s toilet and one men’s toilet. No baby changing facilities in either. There is, however, a public toilet block no more than 50m away from our premises. It has multiple baby changing facilities, in both the female and male toilet blocks. 

The Story:

So a family come into the cafe, they sit down, eat and drink, and then one of her babies must’ve pooped it’s nappy because she came and asked me wether we had any changing facilities. I apologised and informed her that we didn’t, but I pointed out the public toilets and said that they were free and had everything she would need. 

She said it was okay, and proceeded to change the child right on the chair in front of me. I told her that we cannot allow that as it’s disturbing the other customers and that it really isn’t sanitary, especially as we have fresh pastries and cakes in display.

She went ballistic saying that it’s the law that we need to let her change her child wherever she wants if we are unwilling to provide her with suitable changing facilities. I said that she’s more than willing to phone the police, but we cannot let her change her child like this. I again pointed out the public toilets and said that she needed to leave and change her child there. Her whole family got up, left and looked at me like I was a sexist bigot.

AITA for making my mother pay for her tickets?,"I ( 19F, back then 18 ) invited my mother to my graduation ceremony. I sent her an invite 6 months before the event and told her the price of the tickets ( 50€ each ) and that i couldn’t refund them. The ceremony was on a wednesday night, which caused her to have a go at me because she would have to take one of her holiday days to attend ( she has 4-5 weeks of holiday every year ). 

I told her that she didn’t need to come but that i would like her to be there because it’s an one time event in my life. She requested two tickets which i bought for her. She did not send me the money. 

We had a falling out shortly after that and she messaged me in january ( 5 months before the ceremony ) that if our relationship stayed like this, she doesn’t want to come. 
We met in May ( one month before ) and talked. She never brought the ceremony up again and because we were having a nice time, i assumed she’d want to be there. We continued to talk after that.

A day before i still had not heard from her about if she’s coming or not so i decided to message her. She said that she’s not coming because she has to work. That really upset me but i let it go until she messaged me a day later that the real reason was, that she didn’t like my behaviour. 

A week after that i messaged her to ask for my money as i had checked my bank account and saw that she never paid for her tickets. She got angry and told me that my behaviour was unbelievable and rude and that i said that i could resell the tickets so she wouldn’t have to pay. 
Back when i told her about graduation, i did mention that i could technically resell her tickets if she told me about her not being able to come soon enough. The thing is, she didn’t and i wasn’t able to sell the tickets as everyone already got theirs. She said that that’s my problem and that she told me in january that she doesn’t want to come if our relationship stays bad. 

AITA for making her pay and assuming that our relationship was good again? 

Additional Info : our relationship is generally very bad, so meeting and talking like normal people is a good thing to me which is why i assumed she’d want to come. I got the money in the end but we stopped talking after that.

AITA For telling my wife's sister no more,"My wife and I nicely let her sister move in with us a while ago because she moved states. We have simple rules like no people over just because we work overnight and we have jobs that are very sensitive and emotionally taxing, so we need sleep during the day as much as possible. We also nicely let the sister use our car since she cant get one at this time... now to this point...she met a girl who lives like a hour away and they were staying at the girlfriends over the weekend. Because of this we met the girlfriend and we thought she was nice and decided to come in and we will meet her. She came to us a while ago to ask if girlfriend could stay the night two nights and we decided okay since she lives an hour away.

AITA for making a scene on new year's?,"Today, my mum was hosting a small new year's day lunch at our house (I (25F) still live in my childhood home). This lunch was planned well in advance and so was the menu.

Important background info is that I recently had a surgery, that prohibits me from eating specific foods. My mum knows this, and we even visited the doctor and got advice on what we could make for me to eat instead. We agreed on what we were going to make, and that was it (or so I thought).

Yesterday, I was preparing dinner, and my mum asked what I was having tomorrow, and I reminded her of what we had agreed. She replied that she can't make that food only for me specifically, she'd have to make enough for everyone, which would be too much effort, and unnecessary since we were already having 5 other main dishes. I reminded her that I cannot eat any of the dishes so it ISN'T unnecessary, and that we could just make enough for me (realistically it would take 15-20 minutes to make a single serving and we already had all the ingredients on hand, we just had to thaw them).

I reminded her our ""guests"" were literally my brothers, grandpa and my brother's in-laws which are literally family. I offered to make them myself but she dismissed me, said she was going to ""figure it out"", and left the room.

Today, I was in the kitchen making breakfast, when she comes in and asked me what I was going to have for lunch. I looked at her, and asked what she was talking about. She said that she hadn't prepared anything that I can have, nor did she thaw out any chicken or fish for me. I'm really struggling with food right now (and not being able to eat any of my favourite foods), and having all those smells in the kitchen, knowing I had nothing to eat for our new year family lunch (it's a yearly tradition) really triggered me. I started crying and left the room, and she just rolled her eyes at me.

My brother and SIL tried to console me, and we tried to look for places we could order some take out, but nothing was open. I ended up boiling two eggs, and tried to sit at the table while everyone was eating. My grandfather (didn't know about the situation), and asked me ""Why are you just eating eggs? That's not a proper lunch for new years!"". That triggered me again, and I replied that I didn't want to just eat eggs, but my mum didn't care enough to make sure I had something I could eat. Apparently 20 minutes of effort were too much, but going to 4 different supermarkets to find a specific brand of ingredient was not.

When they left, I asked my mum why she didn't prepare something for me, or at least let me know so I could prepare something for myself. She just went off on me saying that I embarrassed her in front our in laws, and that I should be ashamed for making people think that she's a bad mother.

My brothers, SIL and my friends are all on my side, but now she's crying and saying I ruined new year's for her, and I can't help but feel guilty.

AITA for wanting to say hi to my mum before continuing my conversation with my sister?,"Okay, I don't know if this is just my perspective, but this seems really dumb and I need to know if I'm just being insensitive.

I (16NB) recently went on a school trip for 5 days for my theatre class. It was really fun, but I really missed my family. On the last day, we were told that a local newspaper had covered our school trip as part of that day's publication.

I got really excited, texted my mum (47F who we'll call Jan here) and sister (20F who we'll call Max) that I had several copies they could read. It was also revealed to me through text that Jan (who had been feeling unwell for some time) was still feeling horrible, but that she missed me very much. On the train home, I texted Jan and asked if she wanted me to go up to her room to say hi when I got home and she said she wasn't feeling well enough for a proper conversation but did want me to give her a kiss on the cheek and a hug.

When I got home, I quickly left my suitcase and bags in my room and decided I should go to Jan first before talking to Max so that I would be able to talk with my sister instead of just saying hi. However, to get to Jan's room, from mine, I had to pass Max's room and she intercepted me, asking for info about the trip and insisted to see the newspaper article immediately. I said hello and told her I could give her the newspaper and talk about my trip in a minute and that I just wanted to quickly give Jan a kiss.

Max tried to insist we talk first, I continued to tell her I only needed a minute to give Jan a quick kiss and hug (having already given one to Max) and then we could talk about whatever she wanted to, and when she realised I wouldn't budge and would go see Jan before talking to her, she immediately yelled at me and then slammed her door and told me to leave her alone.

So I did, and quietly went into Jan's room, gave her a kiss, a hug, told her I missed her and then went right back out her room. I was not in there for more than 2 minutes.

Later, I talked with Max about our short argument, with me trying to explain that I had wanted to talk to her, but I knew that Jan was feeling terrible and didn't want to be bothered once she got too tired, and I knew the interaction with Jan would not have taken more than 2 minutes. She then explained to me that she had been really excited for my return, and my refusal to talk about it with her or share the article with her immediately made her lose all the enthusiasm and energy she had built up through the day from being excited to see me.

For me, this whole thing feels really dumb, but maybe that's also why I might be the asshole, because I'm not understanding Max's POV. I definitely understand that she'd lose that enthusiasm since I cut the conversation short for a brief moment, but I don't understand why she'd yell at me or get mad at me for that when she knew, probably better than me, that Jan was not in a good state whatsoever, and that I didn't want to bother her any later than I needed to.

WIBTA for cooking a separate meal for myself?,"Background: we (myself, 38F, husband, 38M, two kids (10 and 12) live with my parents (mid-60s) while saving for a house. We split food costs and utilities. I'm the primary cook, and I work really hard to meet every person's dietary and taste preferences; this is nearly impossible! I can't have garlic, onion, wheat, or lettuce. My autistic son can't handle many flavors, so he needs plain foods, paired with fruits, cheese, and nuts to balance his nutrition a bit. My (probably also autistic) daughter loves everything except fruit; she's a true foodie and doesn't like plain food, she loves to experiment with flavors and combinations. My husband likes less carbs, more protein and veggies, though he doesn't abstain from carbs. He doesn't like really plain food, in fact, he has some trauma from childhood associated with some plain foods (such as unseasoned beef). My dad follows keto, so he doesn't do any carbs if possible, but eats high-fat, lots of proteins and veggies. My mom... doesn't like flavor. She would seriously never even use salt or pepper if she could help it. She says worcestershire sauce is disgusting, and won't eat something if she knows it's in it (though she raves about dishes with it so long as she's unaware). She doesn't like garlic. She is impossible to satisfy. 

Like I said above, I work really hard to provide meals that will meet everyone's preferences. This often means multiple side dishes along with our main, so there is something for everyone. I spend hours in the kitchen, and I generally enjoy this. It's a labor of love, and I enjoy providing for those I love. However, frequently, my parents just don't eat what I make. Mom will have a bowl of cereal, because she's ""just not that hungry."" Or they had a big lunch and aren't hungry, yet after dinner will rummage through the fridge for snacks. 

Tonight, I made a very basic casserole. I discussed my meal plan with my mom, she acted very enthusiastic about it. Then, an hour before dinner, she went to the kitchen and cooked some plain ground beef and chopped onion, and ate that. Dad also had that. They ""just couldn't wait till dinner was ready!"" I'm feeling very hurt. Why do I keep trying? I just want to give up at this point. But I'm also feeling spiteful. Which leads to my question. 

WIBTA if, from now on, if my mom cooks dinner for the household, I just make something else for myself, my kids, and my husband? Or if I only start cooking enough for us four, and just stop including my parents?



Edit to add info from a comment: 

Ah... I guess I left out important info, and I tried SO HARD to include everything. My mom gets very passive aggressive if her feelings are hurt. As a teen, I was not allowed to be anything other than happy, because having any other emotion clearly was a direct attack on her as a person. Communication can still be very tense with her under good circumstances, but if anyone has even a slight criticism of her, she completely shuts down, won't speak of even look at that person for days or weeks. Discussing this situation with her would honestly result in the next Cold War in this house.",Not the A-hole
AITA For not picking up parents phone calls?,"Hello heads up English is not my first language so I apologise for any errors I make.

I (27f) work as a waldorf teacher/educator. Only relevant thing about this is that one homeroom teacher stays with the children for 8 years. I'm currently teaching 4th graders. I was not their original teacher I was originally hired as a subsitute teacher 2 years ago when their teacher Melissa was going on maternity leave. She however decided to be a stay at home mum and I was hired as the permanent teacher.

Because the teacher is with the children for so long we naturally are in close contact with their parents. We arrange monthly meetings which most parents attend and I have a group chat with the parents where I send class info or announcements of new meetings to. Melissa had a policy that parents could call her if they needed anything. I decided to keep the same policy but said that they should only call me before 7pm as I have a family of my own as well. However majority of the parents ignore this. For over a year now I receive calls as late as 3am. I have tried over and over again to tell them not to call me that late.  I would understand if the parents had serious concerns to express but more than enough times I received calls about things not even related to their children. Some parents treat me as their therapists assistants or just call me to gossip.

3 months ago I announced to the parents that after 7pm I will only respond to their emails and texts while calls will not be answered. It didn't stop them, I kept getting calls. In a recent parent teacher meeting the parents expressed their frustrations to me not picking up their calls. I reminded them that they are more than welcome to email or text me after 7pm. I told them that I need some time in the evening for myself and my wife. Some parents told me that I am their child's teacher and I should be there 24/7 for the parents like Melissa if I really cared for my students. Some parents took it even further and started calling me names. I tried calming things down but ended up ending the meeting earlier than planned. 

Now for weeks some parents have contacted the principal telling him I told parents not to contact me at all. I showed him the proof that I specifically said no phone calls after 7pm. The principal said while not wrong it is shitty of me to have such a policy and brought up that Melissa never complained about something so small. Multiple other teachers at my school think that I'm selfish while my teacher friend from another school and wife think I'm not in the wrong.

AITA for putting up a no parking sign where my neighbor was parking without talking to her first?,"Okay, so I just moved into an apartment in a big city last month and I’m on the bottom floor of the unit, with two small windows that look out onto the street (this is important). There are two units above me . 
In front of my unit, there’s a big area with a sidewalk, big enough to park a car. Since I moved in, one of the girls from the top unit in my building have been parking in front of my apartment, on the sidewalk (it’s not a driveway or anything, just a sidewalk). Anyways, this car is parked in front of my unit and completely blocks my windows. Like, no light comes in at all and when I look out I can’t even see the street without this car in the way. This person parks there for at least five days on end without moving their car. 
When I moved in, the landlord saw the car there and said he would ask her to move the car (again, he’s told her to move it once before). 
So, she did. The first couple of days I moved in it was gone. Then, a couple days passed and she started parking there again. 
This really became an issue when I had to move furniture into the apartment. Not only does the car block the windows, but it is also really close to the door to get into my unit. I was bringing in a side table and could barely fit past her car without hitting it. 
Even worse, the next week my landlord came by because he was replacing our dishwasher. The moving guys couldn’t get the dishwasher through the door because she was parked there. So, my landlord had to go up to her and ask her to move her car so that they could get the dishwasher in. This was the third time he asked her to move it. 
Anyways, I found a no parking sign in the buildings shared laundry area and decided to put it up on the wall in front of the building to hopefully get her to stop parking there. I didn’t go to her first and ask her to stop parking there, which maybe I should have. So far, she has stopped parking there (it’s only been a day, though).
More info: she’s lived at the unit for two years so maybe it’s rude of me to ask her to move. But like, I’m the first tenant in this unit for at least four or five years. So when she was previously parking there, no one was actually living in the unit. I just feel like it’s kind of rude and inconsiderate since I literally have no light coming through my windows because of her car. It would also get in the way of pedestrians walking on the sidewalk since her car takes up most of the sidewalk. Also, the area we live in—relative to the rest of the city—has a decent amount of street parking. I’ve never really had an issue with it before so I feel like she wouldn’t either if she just tried to find parking not in front of my unit.

WIBTA for telling my husband I’m angry at him for being sunburnt?,"I (32m, swarthy complexion) brought my husband (25m, ginger) on a weeklong beach vacation in Mexico to get away from winter. It’s very expensive by our standards (about $4.5k) and I’ve been planning it for months, coming up with some really cool activities. This isn’t a “once in a lifetime” vacation for us, but it’s big enough to be special, not a regular thing. 
  
 
Yesterday I bought some SPF50 sunscreen for my husband and offered to help him apply it, because I don’t want for him to burn. I told him “I’m going to be really bummed if we can’t do some of these cool things we’ve planned because you’re sunburned after day one”. He declined because he doesn’t like the greasy feeling of sunscreen on his skin; and because I trust him to make his own decisions I let it go. A bit later in the afternoon I noticed his ears were getting red and I offered him my facial moisturizer which is 30spf and doesn’t feel greasy. He declined this and also my offer to buy him a sun hat. “I know my skin, I’ll let you know when I’ve had too much sun” he told me, and I accepted that, though I did reiterate that I was looking forward to activities in the sun and would be upset if we couldn’t do them.
  
 
It’s now day two and because he is sunburn he hasn’t wanted to go on the beach or into the water with me and he’s informed me that he’d prefer to stay on the beach and watch from the shade while I go on the sea turtle snorkeling trip I’ve booked for us. Yes I can have fun doing things on my own, but I’m pretty bummed that it’s starting to look like I’m going to spend a week doing adventurous couples activities by myself.
  
 
TL,DR: Will I be the asshole if I get mad at my ginger husband for refusing to protect himself from the sun and spending our very expensive vacation inside?

There are two other girls E (8) and L (7). My daughter has had sleepovers at mine with both girls. 

L is very spoilt. Her mom is the kind of mom who believes her daughter is alway right. If there’s a problem L is been victimised and picked on. 

E and my daughter are always together. E is always here for dinner. Sleeping over. 
My partner is big on inclusion. He wants the girls to all get on. 

However, L will go out of her way to antagonise my daughter. She calls her names. Gets her big sis to bully and swear at her. She has also stolen half of my daughter’s jewellery. She was seen taking it but I was told after she had left the house. She has been seen wearing it. When we spoke to the mom she insisted she had brought it. My dd name is A. L is wearing a necklace with a mini mouse A on it that’s my dd. My dd is devastated. 

I’ve told my dd she does not have to play or speak to L. However if E wants to she can’t control that and needs to accept that. But E prefers playing with my girl.

AITA for parking in the staff carpark when I wasn't working?,"Apologies for mobile formating. 

I (30F) work at a very good hospital in London. I pay for a permit to park my car in the staff car park because I don't live close enough to a rail station to travel by public transport. (Driving is 30 mins, PT is around 1.5 hours). 

I have a disabled daughter (3) whose specialist happens to be where I work. (For those who don't know the NHS, some conditions have only a few specialist centres. For the most part, you can't choose which one you are assigned to, it'll just be the closest one to your home.)

Last week, my daughter had an appointment (on my day off), so I drove her and parked in the staff carpark. She has a blue badge, but all the disabled bays were full. 

As I was unloading her, I was stopped by a man who informed me that this carpark was for staff only. I said, ""I know, I work here, I'm just taking my daughter to an appointment."" 
They then shouted that with limited parking, I should be using the patient carpark as I am not working today. He said I was ""abusing my position"" by having appointments at my workplace. 

I told him I was late and left, leaving my car there. I've since been wondering if I was the AH and I should've just used the patient car park? I just didn't think it was fair to have to pay twice. 


Additional info: 
Parking is limited at work because it's London and space is expensive.
Permits are only issued to staff who live too far away or work unsocial hours (I fit both those criteria).

AITA for not wanting family dogs in my home?,"I’ll try to give as much info as I can without giving away any very obvious details.

My sister has 2 small breed dogs(terriers), my partners parents have a giant breed dog(Newfoundland) and I love all 3 dogs. 

Normally when my partners family come to visit us they respect my house rule of not bringing their dog, however there was one occasion they turned up with the dog and I refused to let them in and we went to a park instead. Fast forward to now it is freezing cold, snowing and my kids want to stay in where it’s warm. They want to bring their dog with them to visit, I said no. Anyone that knows this breed knows, they are giant, they drip slobber and they shed hair everywhere. We have no pets, I don’t want to have to clean this kind of mess in my home, and honestly the house isn’t big enough to have such a big dog walking round. 
Iv told them if they show up with their dog I will not be letting them in and we won’t be dragging the kids out when it’s this cold and none of us want to go out. My partner told me to let it go this once, but I don’t want to. I don’t want their dog knocking over our things, getting hairs all over my home and slobbering on everything in my house.

Iv had a long day at work, it was awful, maybe I’m just letting my bad mood cloud my judgement. AITA?

Edit just to clarify- It’s not my partners pet but his parents, they bought him 5 years ago and me and my partner have been together for 9 years, living together for 8. This rule has been in place ever since we moved in.

We also live in a VERY small home which is completely unsuitable for such a giant breed of dog, example/ if he was standing in the kitchen there would be no space for him to lie down, turn round etc. Living room isn’t much better size wise either, and I won’t have him in our bedrooms. Other than that there are no other rooms in the house.",Not the A-hole
AITA for following my mothers wishes,"
There is alot of info but I will try to keep it short. My widowed mother and brother had a falling out about 8 years ago and stopped talking. In my opinion, they were both wrong and both too stubborn to make the first move. They both had plenty of opportunities. She wasn't an easy person to get along with, but at the end of the day, she is our mother. My mother was very hurt by this and would answer people when they asked about my brother,"" he doesn't want me to be his mother anymore."" She would constantly tell my family that she doesn't want him to know anything about her and not to tell him anything. This affected my relationship with my brother as well. My mother met with her lawyer and took my brother's name off everything and changed her will to leave me and my children her estate. She took him off as Health Care Proxy and Power of Attorney as well. As her health issues began to get worse, it became my responsibility alone to take care of her. With an exhausting process and alot of work, we were able to get her approved for Medicaid so we could get her health aides at home. It became apparent that even that wasn't enough, and I had to make the hardest decision of my life, that my mother needed to go into a nursing home. The process and guilt were exhausting. IN April my mother was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. I asked her if she wanted me to let my brother know and she said yes. When I called him to let him know, i did share my anger that their situation left me to do everything and make the hardest decision I had to make in my life by putting her in a nursing home. Long story short, he began to visit her in the nursing home. I really don't know if they ""made up"" as I was not part of any of those conversations and my mother became non-verbal. During this time my relationship with my brother got alot better. A month after my mother passed, my brother sent me an upsetting text. He stated that he had to ask me a question, to which he probably knew the answer to, and was distraught with emotion. He then asked if my mother left him anything in her will. I replied that about 4 yrs ago my mother went to her lawyer and changed everything, leaving his part to my kids. I also told him that I was happy that we finally became closer over the last 6 months, that this was her decision alone and I hoped this wouldn't affect our relationship. It is now 10 months since his text, and we don't talk anymore. I have tried to reach out at times and get either one word or no response. I know I followed my mother's wishes but am I wrong for not giving him something. Sadly, it seems to me and friends that he only came back for the money.",Not the A-hole
AITA for almost completely avoiding talking to a girl?,"Sorry but I have to speedrun this post. I will reply in comments any additional info and edit as we go along. I used to go out with a girl from work. We were from different countries, different cultures, at different points of life (I wasn't even looking for a GF, but she wanted to get married). Didn't work out. We were always fighting (more like she was critical of everything I do, especially the nice things that I apparently did wrong). From my side, it felt like she treated me like an ATM and a toilet rag. Of course, this is only my side. She broke up with me. Found some other dude. Broke up with him. We were friends during that. I still talked to her just fine. 

A few months ago, we went out on a vacation (totally platonic). She invited me, took care of the travel and accommodation. To me, a vacation is rest from work. To her, it was going somewhere to ""be part with nature"". I still went with her wherever she wanted to go. And someone, by the end of it all, she blamed me for ""not planning where to go"". Again, I didn't want to go anywhere. I wanted to do some casual sightseeing and just chill out.

I started resenting a lot about myself. I come across the continent for work, so no friends or family. I knew this girl since I came here and spent most of my time with her, so no extra friends. Everything she said, I genuinely tried to change myself and become better. I still sometimes feel insufficient and changed a lot from before coming here. I feel overwhelmingly emotional when someone treats me as a human, when that same treatment can be expected from strangers back home. This isn't to portray her as some demon witch. This is again, only my end of the seesaw.

After that trip, I said enough and just avoided any conversation with her. We still work together and I have to talk occasionally, but it's nowhere near what we used to talk. And honest to God, I am soooo much better without the rancid nonsense. 

Here's the thing. I feel like I was her only friend here. I genuinely feel sorry that I am doing this. I try to make small talk, say hi, smile when she says something. But I don't want to share anything unnecessary. I don't want to know about her life. I have a contract for another 2 years and I want to forget she even existed. If I see her laughing with atleast one other person on a daily basis, I would genuinely feel be so much better. But I don't want to torture myself again. 

Sorry for the incoherent rambling. I feel like a complete ass. I know I am. I don't want support. I don't want people to feel sorry for me. I have great friends (at home), a supportive mother and overall blessed family to rely on. She doesn't. That's what bothers me. What should I do??",Not the A-hole
AITA For Asking My Mother & Father In Law To Choose Between Their Two Daughter-in-law‘s?,"Right before I was about to leave for my M&FIL house I got a phone call from my husband, husband was extremely upset and asked me if I had left for his parents yet. I said no and he told me he needed to make me aware of a situation, a few hours before his father called him and shared with him screenshots of a dating app profile containing my name and photos. 

Before I could say anything my husband reassured me he knew it was fake.
A few things that tipped him off.
1. Screenshots from the profile said “less than a mile away” when referring to the distance of the user.
2. It was my SIL who found the account. My straight, female, and married SIL just randomly decided to go on bumble and somehow fell upon my profile even though we live over 100 miles apart. 

When I got to M&FIL's house FIL rushed out to talk to me, he told me I had every right to be upset but asked me to be the bigger person and not cause any more unnecessary drama. 

When I got to SIL, initially she denied everything but after about 2 minutes she couldn’t keep her story straight. Instead of apologizing she just started bawling her eyes out, she blamed the whole thing on pregnancy hormones and tried to play it off as a joke. 

My M&FIL both pulled me outside to try and get me to calm down. I asked them why they were taking her side they told me there were no sides and they were just trying to keep the peace. 

After they said that I lost it and told them keeping the peace it’s just an excuse used by enablers. I told them that they had a very important decision to make, if they choose to standby SIL they will lose me as consequence. 

They told me they were afraid to lose their grandchild and I responded with “You're going to lose a set of grandchildren, either way, it’s either going to be the ones in front of you now or the future grandchildren me and husband will have.” 

My husband and I are on the same page and we have both agreed to cut contact with his family unless some kind of just consequence for SIL happens.

Edit: 

Background info
Husband is currently 12 months into an 18 month deployment for the military.

Edit 2:

I feel like I need to clarify the family relations.
I am not biologically related to anyone in this post. 

I am married to my husband who is biological related to his brother. BIL is married to SIL 
FIL & MIL have two biological sons and two daughter-in-law‘s (myself and sister-in-law)

Update
 
I would first like to say thank you to everyone who commented and sent me information and tools on how to deal with my situation. I have read all comments multiple times and although I didn’t get back to everyone I tried to take all the information as best I could. 
 
My y husband and I talked about everything that happened between me and his family, after a lot of back-and-forths we couldn’t agree on how to handle the situation so we decided to do couples therapy. 

After therapy, we have both decided to completely cut all communication and ties with his brother and SIL. As for his parents, the plan is for me to no longer go and see them or for me to make any active attempt to communicate or be a part of their lives. If his parents do not attempt to reach out to me for the remainder of my husband‘s deployment (5 months) then we have decided to go no contact with his parents and cut them off completely.

The biggest question I saw in the comments is why does my SIL hate me so much? Here is some more information,
 
1. SIL became pregnant after two weeks of dating BIL, SIL and BIL remained unemployed throughout SIL entire pregnancy and lived 100% off of the means of my in-laws. My husband and I are homeowners and both of us are very successful in our independent careers.
 
1. SIL has always struggled with what she wants to do with her life, she doesn’t like taking care of her baby but doesn’t want to work. She goes back and forth on these grandiose ideas for a career but doesn’t want to go back to college. 
 
About a year and a half ago my SIL started talking about becoming a realtor, but they couldn’t afford the fees and classes required to do so. I had always toyed with the idea of getting my realtors to license so I told my SIL I would happily pay for her classes, fees, etc and she and I could go through the courses together.
After a month my SIL bailed on the idea of becoming a realtor but I finish and got my license. 
 
1. I am unable to physically have children, I found this out a few years ago, and emotionally I have never recovered. Ever since I found out I refuse to hold or play with any baby, older kids are easier but emotionally I am not mature enough to interact with a baby yet. I have never held my SIL baby and although I have had conversations with her directly as to my reasons as well as my in-laws they take it very personally. I have this issue with all babies even my sister‘s and best friend's baby. I am currently in counseling.    

My husband and I have decided that we are going to start looking for a house in my home state so that way I can be closer to my old friends and my family.  And no matter which way things go with his parents we both believe some distances is a good idea.  

P.S I have not given up on my cake decorating hobby and since then I have made almost a dozen more cakes for friends and neighbors. Thank you to everyone who gave me the confidence for moving forward and not giving up.",Not the A-hole
AITA for ignoring texts and calls from my brother's soon to be ex-wife?,"My [33M] older brother [34M] is splitting up with his wife [31F] after getting married to her in 2016. I'm not super duper close with my brother so alot of this info is from what has been told to me by other family members/friends. 

Covid hit them hard, issues about having kids and some other stuff lead to my brother ending things with her. I initially assumed she had left him but that's not the case, he was ready to have a family and Rachel did not.
I have always been friendly with ""Rachel"" but I only saw them around holidays or on vacations, thank goodness because we have nothing at all in common and she was annoyingly ""basic"" but that's not the worst thing in the world so whatever.

Be aware... Rachel and I didn't ever text or call each other outside of the occasional holiday text.

After being separated now for a year and half they are finalizing the divorce, they gotta split up wedding gifts, deal with financial stuff, etc which has nothing to do with me. I'm going through some shit with my own life right now so I really don't have the energy/time/desire to involve myself. 

So now I have her texting me and calling me, whenever she can't get ahold of my brother or to say happy holidays and stuff. Now I know I'm being a bit of a dick for ignoring the 'happy birthday' or Thanksgiving messages, but I don't want her using me to get messages to my brother, I don’t think it’s appropriate for her to blow up my phone saying she’s worried about my brother since he wasn’t responding either (he was on a plane) and that it’s important that I respond 

Basically I don’t want to be involved in anyway of this divorce, I liked her enough but I don’t want to be her friend either, and if they happen to get back together, we can be buddy buddy again. Sad but if I never saw her again I’d be okay.

Should I be more communicative with her and answer her OR does she need to see that texting me isn’t appropriate.

AITA for defending my friend and myself?,"Our Cast;

* H; friend who was going through some stuff
* Y; ""friend"" of H and I
* T; ""friend"" of H and I, dating Y, essentially a carbon copy of Y.
* M; ""friend"" didn't really do anything but deflect
* Me

Timeline (set, months ago)

* Tuesday; Group hangout YTM and I. H going through it so didn't come, and deleted Instagram that night. H called me at 2 a.m. on but I was asleep so when I awoke I reached out, and continued to reach out, trying my best to help them.
* Sunday; Instagram call with TMY. T started making jokes and saying ""someone better have died."" I got upset and typed in the chat ""it's serious, they'll tell you if they want to.""
   * Context; H deletes instagram whenever they have something major going on, be it SATs, opening night for a show, death in the family, etc.

This is where the depression hits and I lost all sense of time so no more bullet points.

TMY kept talking about how much it sucked being kept in the dark and essentially had a triple self pity party. 

(Context; they all said that H didn't owe anyone an explanation in a previous issue and are now complaining about not getting one). 

When I got home I left the group chats after calling them immature and telling them to stop whining. Someone in another gc asked what happened and Y said ""he's petty and immature""

I understand that I did too much, and I acknowledged that in a DM with Y. But I felt it was a smarter move to avoid losing my cool at them in a different gc which didn't involve anyone there and escalating the issue. When I talked to Y in DMs they completely refused to acknowledge any wrongdoing on there behalf, be it apathy, hypocrisy, smack talk, or stubbornness, not one word of reconciliation.

Because of that YT started vague posting about H and I. 

i asked ""why? If you consider yourself to be a friend of either H or I you wouldn't be doing this."" 

Y and T responded that they felt it was a damned-if-you-do/don't situation (it wasn't they had each other to talk to and didn't need to post it for everyone to see). I then basically told them to screw off and blocked them, immature I know.

Edit; Since I didn't have enough info, YT&M all whined about not getting an explanation and never tried to communicate with H after they deleted instagram. YTM in the gc talked down to me and was petty throughout (i.e. Y; ""I'm the closest so it just hurts yk?"" T; ""I'm glad they at least have someone like you to turn to..."" and more)

TLDR; 3 friends started smack talking 1 and me on instagram while 1 had deleted the app, I defended them before getting upset and leaving multiple group chats. Am I the asshole?",Not the A-hole
AITA for buying a Christmas wreath?,"My fiancé (f) and I (m) moved into our first home in October this year, we had bought Christmas decorations and put them up on the 1st of December. In my family it is tradition to put a wreath on the front door. However my fiancé’s family have never put up a wreath because it upsets her Mum because of her (deceased) grandad. Both my fiancé and I put up the decorations thinking nothing of it but when my MIL came over she refused to step in the house and is saying she won’t come over (she usually comes to look after our kids) until we throw it away. We said we would just take it down when she came over but that wasn’t good enough for her. And now because we are going against her wishes she is saying she doesn’t want to go to our wedding (on the 21st.) 
I’m stubborn and won’t throw it away because it is OUR home. So AITA and what would you do?

WIBTA if I told my sister that I think she needs to be more attentive to her kids and their cleanliness,"TLDR at the end.

Edit to add more info at the end.

Here's a little bit of information for context. My husband and I have no children, and are not ever having any. We also tend to keep quite a clean, tidy and organized household. My sister and her husband have 4 children and their house is not well kept at all. Not only is it cluttered and disorganized (as one would expect a family of 6 to have) but it's quite dirty. Cleaning has never been my sister's strong suit. Her and I are only 2.5 years different in age, so we were raised completely together and in the same way, along side our other two siblings. We were raised in a semi traditional, religious household that taught us a lot of life skills LIKE cleaning, cooking, outside/farm work, crafting, etc...

Now, there are several things that I disagree with about how my sister raises her household, but I'm posting about one specific issue, so I'll try my best to stick to that. My husband and I have my 12 year old niece visiting us this week. She decided to pack up her favorite pillow and blankets to bring with her, which I thought was odd since we have a full spare room and extra everything for her to use in our house. It's not like she was visiting us in an apartment and was sleeping on the couch or floor. I asked her to unpack her things and noticed her pillow case was incredibly dirty. I then took a closer look at her blankets and did a little sniff test and they were horribly dirty too!!! So while my niece and husband were upstairs I decided to wash her things. My washer has a ""sanitize"" setting so they had the cleaning of their lives! When I took her pillow case off of her pillow the pillow itself was incredibly stained as well. Pillows are harder to clean, but I felt it was necessary, so I did. I then went upstairs to niece and husband having dinner, so I sat down and explained to niece that I decided to wash her bed things. She gave me a little look of attitude, but I nipped that quick and told her it's very important to keep those things clean since you surround yourself with them every night. 

WIBTA if I told my sister that I'm disappointed and concerned she isnt attentive enough to her kids and their surroundings?

I always feel hesitant with these situations because she always tells me ""you wouldn't understand"" because I'm not a mother, let alone a mother of 4. But OUR MOTHER was a mother of 4 and she did an amazing job... 

TLDR: Im babysitting my niece, some of her personal items she brought from home were terribly dirty. WIBTA if I told my sister I'm disappointed and concerned that she doesn't care for her kids closely enough?

Info 1: she is a stay at home mom. Dad works.

Info 2: I live 2 hours away so I can't just ""pop in"" to help.

AITA for getting mad at my friends for not warning me?,"About two weeks ago, a former friend, who I will call Casey (24F) and I (22F) ended our friendship. It wasn’t over one thing in particular, but we kept having small fights that eventually soured our entire friendship and we decided that it would be better off if we stopped talking. Even though I cut contact with Casey, a lot of people in my friend group didn’t. I was ok with them still being friends with Casey as long as they knew that I was not comfortable being around her for now.

A few days ago, my friends and I decided to throw a small party to celebrate one of our friend’s, Caleb’s (22M) recent promotion at work. I knew that Caleb was still friends with Casey, but I thought that she wouldn’t be invited if he knew I was going.

When I got to the party, I saw that Casey was already there, talking with a few guests. When she spotted me, she leaned in closer to the people she was speaking with, and started whispering about something that I couldn’t hear. Everyone then looked at me and started laughing. This happened about two or three more times over the course of the entire party. I tried to ask a few people what they were laughing at, but I kept getting vague answers or got brushed off. I got fed up, gave Caleb my congratulations, and decided to leave the party early.

The next day, I asked everyone in my friend group if they knew that Casey would be invited to the party, and they all replied that they did. I asked why no one warned me that Casey would be there, since they knew that her being there would hurt me. I was then told that it would’ve been selfish of me to not want Casey to be there since Caleb is still friends with Casey, and it was his celebration.

I said that it would’ve been fine if Casey was there, just that I would’ve liked to know first so that I could prepare myself or skip the party entirely. They said that it would’ve been rude of me to skip the party since it was for Caleb’s promotion, and that they didn’t tell me Casey would be there because they knew that I’d want to skip.

I brought up the fact that I thought it was rude that Casey was talking about me throughout the entire party and no one told her to stop. Someone asked if I actually heard what Casey was saying, and I said no but I could assume from people’s reactions. They said that since I wasn’t close enough to hear, I couldn’t know for sure if Casey was badmouthing me or not and that I probably only thought so because I have bad history with Casey.

I was told that I was blowing things out of proportion and that I shouldn’t make everything about me. I was kicked out of the friend group after that. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA Did I blow my girlfriend off?,"My girlfriend (40F) and I (40M) have been dating for a relatively short period of time, but we have decided that we would like to get married. We are both christians and I have not spoken to her father yet about us getting married. She knows I am going to do this, and it was something that we both felt was good to do.

Last night we had been on the phone for three hours just talking. We do this pretty much every night because we currently live in different states. About 1045 pm, I told her I needed to start moving towards bed because I had to be up at 630 am. We were talking for a few more mintes and I reminded her again that I needed to start moving towards bed. We continued talking, and she started to talk about what she might want in a wedding. There was a long pause, and I thought she was done. I said that I wanted to hear more, but could we do it the next day so I could get some sleep. She and I have had several discussions about me getting enough sleep (I have some mental health issues, and getting enough sleep is critical to keeping myself healthy. My psychiatrist noticed my exhaustion over a zoom call, I have been getting little sleep.). I dont want to say every time, but it regularly feels like when I am trying to get off the phone to take care of myself, its a problem. After I asked if we could get off the phone she got upset and told me I was blowing her off and didnt care what she was saying. Being completely honest, there may be an issue of pride on my part, but I try hard to listen to what people are telling me, and I took her seriously. We talked about it for a few minutes and I was clear that I did not think I had blown her off. This was apparently the wrong answer, because she said she didnt know if she wanted to talk to me anymore. I have spent a lifetime accepting responsibility for things I shouldnt, and I was not going to accept responsibility for something I didnt feel like I had done. I did not share this with her, but she knew i was pretty upset. I did not yell at her, I just said ""I love you, youre going to have to chase me off, and I will talk to you tomorrow."" She did not say anything at all, and after about thirty seconds I hung up and went to bed. I texted her this morning to tell her that I love her and she saw it,but has not responded. I think it is entirely relevant to mention that she has suffered some significant trauma at the hands of other men, and it has caused some serious trust issues for her. She is getting therapy. I think shes worth dealing with the trust issues. I do not want to lose her. I have tried to be as objective here as I can, but I will answer questions and provide more info to a point. I will not betray her confidence.

Was I a jerk last night? If I was I will apologize to her and try to make it right. Thanks in advance.

AITA for not letting the police and neighbors use my driveway,"Going to begin with saying that legally I am in the clear. It's my property and I can do as I wish with it. I bought a piece of land and had a house built on it recently. There was a gravel road(now paved) that has become my driveway. I guess before I lived there the locals used it to get around faster. I've been told that if they can't use my driveway it makes the travel 15 minutes longer. This started when I moved in. The stuff like the yard and surrounding area was not finished but it was complete enough to move in. My driveway is long and can be exited or entered from two sides. With how the house is built for them to use my driveway as a shortcut a lot of traffic would pass right by my house and cars every day. This isn't just people driving. People on bikes and walkers want to use it too. I simply do not want the whole town driving through my driveway every day. I realized it was a problem when I moved in and could constantly hear cars driving through all hours of the night. Or voices of people talking and people walking right past the cars. I understood that this property was vacant for a while so I put up signs saying that this is private property. You can clearly see a house there and I'm sure they saw it being built. No change. So I put up gates that only me and my wife have access to. It doesn't deter the walkers but I have plans for that.

&#x200B;

This caused a big fuss. I've had numerous people knock on my door asking why I put a gate up. Saying they will be late to work or school. I had a guy say I made him late to an interview. I just tell everyone that this is private property and that this house didn't just appear here. You saw it built. You saw the signs if this were a route you used daily. Apparently the police used this as a speedtrap area and I've had police ask me to open the gates. I tell them no. My wife normally is the type to let people use the driveway but this wasn't normal. Imagine the whole town using it like a shortcut. There was so much traffic constantly. The first complaint I got before the gates were up was when I parked my car on the driveway and not on the part in front of my house. Because it was ""blocking the traffic."" I responded ""the traffic of my property?"" I've had cops tell me I am obstructing their work. My direct neighbors understand but town people are just upset that their shortcut is gone. They are pretty upset about the house being here all together. People would park their cars all over the driveway and my property during sport events(high school football is important around here). I'm not trying to be an evil neighbor. AITA?

INFO EDIT

For those wondering. Yes, I've talked to lawyers and this is my property. I initially didn't want the two outlets because to me it looks odd.

AITA for resenting my coworker and holding her accountable and calling her out in a group message.,"  

  Me ,43 single mom, her 32ish married mom of 3. We’ve worked at a small family owned company for 7 years. We have always gotten along great. About a year ago she had a baby. Without asking our VERY passive boss about maternity leave she just decided that she was going to work from home. She didn’t want to put her kid in daycare.  Her choice , not a big deal as I did the same with my kids. A year has passed and she has no intention of returning to the office. There is a very small part of our job duties that is combined.  One duty that we share is being on call. Every other weekend we are supposed to swap the company phone and we each get paid accordingly for having it. Its not much but its enough for me to pay a small bill.  I have struggles to make ends meet. Most days I’m working 15+ hours a day to keep the lights on. Late 2022 it became increasingly harder to get her to bring the phone to the office when it was my turn and I do depend on that extra income when I budget for the month. Twice she was to busy to bring it to town. I addressed the issue with the boss and He said she was not doing what she was supposed to be doing and he would address it and pay me anyways. Since the new year there has not been an issue with the phone. 

I can’t finish my workday until she gets all her work entered.  Since late 2022 there have been NUMEROUS times that I am waiting until after 5 for her to enter info. I have hinted and asked that she please have her stuff done so I can leave at 5 to get to my other job to the point where I started calling her out on the group message. Yesterday I had had enough. I was at the office until 6:30 and she had some missing info.  I called her twice. No Answer. Mind you she gets paid extra to answer the phone after hours.  20 minutes later she texted. I did not see it so I just finished her work and let the group know about the missing info so that she could record it in her reports at the end of the day. Then I got text from her on her personal phone asking if I had questions about invoices that I need to text her directly. SO, I did just that. I started another group message with her, the boss and the manager. I stated that since she doesn’t want to answer the phone and only text that I would be messaging in this private group so there is some transparency and some accountability. I let her know that I didn’t want to get blamed when customers weren’t paying invoices because she hadn’t put them in. If she couldn’t get them in I would do it for her so I can finish my day and she can fix them on her own time on her PAID rainout weeks at home. She had 7 hours to put in the last two invoice of the day . There are other issues of her not doing her job but most of it doesn’t affect me doing my job.

She would be staying with my parents who take great care of her and I trust them, so it's not that - I'm just a new mom who doesn't want to leave her baby for such a long time, the idea makes me almost sick. I've left her for 3 days to take a vacation with my husband but 8-9 days feels too long to me. 

Because it's a cruise we can't get on late or leave early - we're stuck with being away for 8-9 days. For context, my husband's family, besides his parents, has never cared about him or treated him well. Not once after our baby was born did anyone ever ask how she was or how we were doing. His brother didn't even know what he was doing in his career and has never shown any interest in any of us. His nieces are spoiled brats. 

I told him, with 100% honesty, that if it's that important to him to go then he can go without me, I do not want to hold him back. But he says it's with me or not at all, but has now told me that if I don't go he'll resent me for making him miss this trip. 

I tried to compromise that I would go if I can just see our baby in the morning and then leave for the cruise (drive 1.5 hrs to airport, fly 2.5 hrs to get there) but he says that's impossible and puts the trip at risk if we miss our flight.  I'm trying to make it work but really do not feel at all okay leaving my baby girl for so long.

He is telling me if he cancels it will completely ruin the relationship he has with his family and it would be my fault. Like he wouldn't even be able to come to the holiday event anymore. 

ETA: We COULD take her with us, but she has a really hard time sleeping outside the home, and most of all then it wouldn't be a vacation for us. Couldn't drink much and wouldn't be able to do anything after like 6pm. Basically why spend the money to go on a cruise if we couldn't enjoy it the way we'd like to. I also don't want her around so many germs and people so young when she's vulnerable. 

I DID agree to go when I was still pregnant, but I hadn't understood at the time how it would pain me to be away for over a week from her. 

Yes, I know it's silly that one day would make a difference in my mind but that's just how I am marketing it to myself.

We also have not paid the full amount yet and can still get our deposit back.",Not the A-hole
AITA for checking the status of the flight my wife didn't take?,"My wife visited her sister for 4 days to see the new baby.  Our 12yo also went and I stayed home with the 6yo twins.  Their trip went fine, but three hours before their scheduled flight back, the flight was delayed 30 min and my wife's brother-in-law convinced my wife that 15 min wasn't enough time for the layover in Atlanta.  My wife called me after she had already canceled her original tickets and bought new last-minute ($$) tickets on a different airline and updated me on the new flight info.  She sounded frazzled but it seemed like she handled everything.  I picked her up at 1am (with the twins in tow) and on the ride home, they debriefed us on the trip and the hectic flight home.  Everyone was settled in and in bed when out of morbid curiosity I looked up the original flight's status.  Turns out it only left 10min late and arrived at the layover on time. My wife became very upset at me because she saw it as me criticizing her decisions.  I told her that I wasn't blaming her, that she was making the decisions in the moment with limited info, and this was only in hindsight.  I honestly thought it was a ""oh, that sucks"" moment.  Things are ok now, but the whole morning consisted again listening to the litany of all my faults and failures.  AITA?",Not enough info
AITA for not wanting our housemate to find a replacement when she leaves at the end of the month?,"We (f20, f22) live with another girl (f22) in a 3-bed apartment in a European country. Our contract is until June 23. We are all from native English-speaking countries. The 3 of us have become good friends, hang out all the time & host our group of friends at our apartment most weekends. One girl has decided to leave at the end of Feb (due to being unhappy in her job) with 4 months left on the lease.


We respect her decision, & said we’d be happy for another English-speaking person to move in. It doesn’t have to be their 1st language, just enough that we could speak this country’s lang + Eng. She brushed this off, saying she couldn’t help that as we don’t live in a majority Eng country. But she said if we find no replacement, she’d still pay her rent. She took sole responsibility for finding a new flatmate, only sending us info of people she deemed OK, but none speak Eng.

We told her we are willing to pay more rent, meaning in the next 4 months, she’d pay for just over 1 month’s rent total. This avoids the stress of her finding and us living with someone new. We consider this a compromise as she’s the one breaking the contract & she was already planning to leave a month before the lease ends.

She said it’s unreasonable for us to essentially rule out non-native Eng speakers. We clarified what we meant (as above), and said we already offered a compromise that avoids this issue. She said this is ultimately a financial decision, & it’s the risk we all signed up for as we didn’t know each other when we moved in, and the reality of an individual leaving a rental contract means they get replaced, not necessarily by someone who meets all of the remaining tenants’ requirements. She is also taking a week vacation in another country rn, quitting her job, and moving to another country to become an au pair ?? 

However, we both think this isn’t what we signed up for - we agreed to live as a 3 for the whole time. As her friends, we want her to consider our preference & we literally offered to pay more to ease her burden, so it’s a financial decision for us too. It’s also an emotional decision - we are a very social apartment and feel that she has relegated us from friends to just flatmates. We consider our home to be a safe space and it would feel very uncomfortable living with a stranger who doesn’t speak the same language. 

We agreed to have more viewings, but we wanted to make it clear that paying more & having no 3rd roommate was our preferred choice since we are the people who would have to live with a new person. She thinks wanting an Eng speaker is an unrealistic preference and that her saving rent money is the most important thing. We think that given we have become friends through living together, this is more than just a transaction, & our lives will be more impacted by living with someone unknown more than her having to pay a month’s rent.

TLDR: 3 English-speaking friends live together in a foreign country. One is moving out & wants a stranger to take over the remaining time on the lease. The other 2 would prefer to pay some more rent instead of living with a stranger who doesn’t speak the same language.",Not the A-hole
AITA for asking family member to leave,"I am 35F. Live with husband 38M and two kids. For the last month on and off his cousin has been sleeping on our sofa. He is 35M and has a girlfriend who lives in a another town who is heavily pregnant. He did have his own apartment until recently but was evicted due to non-payment of rent and has been travelling between our home and his girlfriend's home since October. He has our house key because he used to help us feed our three dogs when we went on vacation but is now using the key to let himself into our home whenever he likes without telling anyone, and then disappearing later. He is eating our food, using our appliances, using our WiFi, watching our TV. No offer of help paying for groceries, rent or bills. He is using our home like a hotel. He works from home and earns $50k and due a pay rise so he does have money however always seems short of money. He says he is looking for a place but seems to make no progress. 
Here's where I might be the asshole. I am close with his cousin and we have been good friends for years. I have said to him in the past he could come over when he wants and spend time with us as we enjoy his company. I didn't mean like this though. I meant in a social capacity. Maybe he took it to mean more than that.
I did confront him earlier today saying he couldn't carry on staying here like he was and made him book a hotel overnight to go to and told him to please leave. He booked a hotel room and left. He then called his dad crying that he'd been thrown out. My husband is really pissed at me for him being throw out, even through I know he wanted him to leave too. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my mom that her apology isn’t enough?,"I (22f) am my mom’s (40f) oldest child. She has another daughter named Andy (4f) that she and her wife Ella (38f) had together shortly after they got married.

I’m not very close with my mom. My bio dad wasn’t the best person, and I know that in her eyes, I was just a reminder of him. 
When I was 8, she sent me off to live with my grandmother, and really the only time I ever heard from her was when she’d send money for me every few months.

I spent a very large portion of my childhood wondering why she didn’t want me, or why she never seemed to even like me. I would always create reasons as to why, convincing myself that I must have done something wrong. Before Andy was born, and my mother and I had sort of started to speak more than we had previously, my therapist suggested that I just sit my mom down and talk to her directly. Instead of wondering what the answers were, I could just hear them from the source.

My mom told me that she sent me to live with my grandmother because she couldn’t stand being near me. Me being out of her sight made it easier for her to pretend I didn’t exist, which then made it easier for her to go on with her life and heal.
I don’t blame her for feeling that way, like I said my bio dad isn’t a good person, and I get why she couldn’t handle being my mom. I don’t necessarily forgive her because I was a kid and I deserved better but I also don’t hold her totally responsible because I know she was going through a lot.

I’m not sure how much her wife Ella knows about our history, but she has been very clearly trying to get my mom and I to reconnect.
I guess she wants me to know Andy. Maybe they both do, but I’m not sure.

My mom asked me to meet her for coffee to talk. While we were at the coffee place, she told me that she was sorry about how things played out between us, and that she hoped her apology was enough for me to forgive her. I said that it meant a lot to hear her say sorry, but that her saying it wasn’t enough for me to just forgive and forget it all. I understand her and I empathize with her, but I can’t forgive her.

After I left, she ended up texting me and telling me how unfair I was being to tell her that her “sorry” wasn’t enough. She said it took a lot for her to get to the point where she could own up to this, and me just saying it essentially meant nothing, really hurt her feelings.
In her last text she said that I didn’t have to outright say I can’t forgive her, especially since I do seem to want to have some sort of relationship with her, I could have just kept that info to myself.

I guess she’s right. I definitely didn’t have to say it, but I did.

Edit:

Please read my comments for further context (sorry I didn’t include it here) but my mother isn’t a narcissist and I don’t think she’s a bad person. I think we’re both unfortunately products of our situations and I’m not mad at her. Not really. I don’t like that it happened, and I wish that I could change it, but I obviously can’t. I recognize that she was hurt but I also recognize that I was a child, and while her hurt explains why my childhood was the way it was, I know it doesn’t entirely excuse it.",Not the A-hole
AITA for wanting my partner to clean up after herself?,"I'm 23M and my partner is 26F. I'm a step father to our 6 year old daughter and we also live with my partner's sister, 25M, who's moved out for the first time. With that being said, over the last few months I've felt a lack of effort in being consistent in our household with keeping things clean. Throughout all of last year, things have slipped mental health-wise. Both of us independently decided to try and get things back on track mentally. She's been working on her spiritual practices and tending to her many plants. I've gone to the doctor to get meds prescribed for my ADHD.

Over the last couple months, I've been trying my hardest to be consistent. I've been picking up my dishes when I'm done eating and rinsing them, picking up my items that I see that I've left out, making sure my cup collection doesn't get too huge. But I keep noticing that my partner doesn't do any of that. I've got no room in our 1 sink bathroom because of her stuff. I try to subtly encourage her and lead by example but it didn't seem to be clicking. Sister doesn't do anything, even after a conversation leading to her promising to do the dishes more while my partner does all the cooking. She hasn't done the dishes in 2 weeks, leaving me to do all of the dishes every other times like usual. I don't get on my partner's case about things at all since she cooks and buys a lot of things for the house. I've noticed other things like my step daughter all of a sudden not putting her dishes away when she's done eating, despite being capable of doing them before without asking. She even does this when my parents babysit her at their house and my parents are a little frustrated with it.

So today, I got frustrated that I wasn't able to sleep in as I'm usually the one that gets up to handle whatever requests my step daughter has at 7am. This lead to me bursting (more aggressive than needed) my feelings about how she doesn't pick up after herself. She got defensive and was extremely upset that I was saying this without acknowledging the work she does already around the house. She told me that she just isn't the person to pick up after herself and that she prefers to leave everything until she's ready to clean, and will get it all cleaned at once. This lead to a whole argument and now she won't speak to me. Now, don't get me wrong, I understand she does a lot for the house already and I do too, but is it too much to ask that she finds a way that works with her to pick up her own dishes and rinse them off so they don't have to sit until she feels like cleaning the whole house and so I don't have to take the time to scrub tons of food off of the dishes? My whole problem is that she's not consistent so our house can't look clean on a daily basis and is instead usually clean for about two days before being messy again. Am I the asshole here?

AITA for blowing up at my husband after he took a new job without discussing it with me further like he said he would?,"Recently, my(38F) husband (34M) casually mentioned that he had applied for a new position at work. Basically, he would be doing the same thing he is now, but this would be like an added responsibility that would involve being on call regularly. It would also involve going out of state for a week for training. I wasn’t wild about this because it would leave me alone with our two young kids more often and he’s already on call on a regular basis as it is. Also, we’ve been having some behavior issues with our daughter plus I haven’t been sleeping well, so it overwhelms me a bit more then it probably would otherwise. He seemed to understand my hesitations, and assured me that he wasn’t committing to anything just yet, he was just applying, he didn’t even know if he’d get it, etc. Basically, he was saying we had plenty of time to think about it more and discuss the pros and cons etc. He also agreed with my suggestion of talking to some other folks that have had the same position about what to expect in the way of time commitment.  That was the last we spoke of it.
Fast forward to a week later: he was out of town visiting his parents, when he told me over the phone that he found out he had gotten the position and that he leaves for training next month. I was livid! I asked him what in the world happened to him not committing to anything just yet and us taking time to talk it over some more and weigh the pros and cons etc. He said he was caught off guard too because he didn’t realize he would hear back so quickly or that he would even get the position, but that he had to make a decision. I told him I still wasn’t wild about the decision and that I was really unhappy that he committed to it when we hadn’t talked about it more. He just got angry and said that I should be understanding of the fact that this came up quickly, and that I should ultimately be supportive of his decision. I’m not opposed to the general idea of being supportive of his decision sometimes when it goes against what I would prefer. The problem here is that he assured me we would talk about it some more, and then we didn’t. At the very least I think he should’ve been more understanding of the fact that this came up suddenly, and that I might be disappointed that we didn’t get a chance to discuss it further.

AITA for asking for separate checks at dinner?,"I need to present the event that lead up to my conflict: Five of us went out to a bar for Sarah's birthday. Everyone ordered drinks (this was an expensive place so the drinks cost $19 each). Beth, Sarah, and I got an $13 appetizer to share. Noah got a $25 burger for himself.

The check came. It was presented on one of those handheld tablets that the waiter stands there with so Beth, Noah and I gave our cards and the bill was split evenly three ways. After we paid, Sarah's bf asked how much he owed for his drink. It would have been around $5 each he owed us not including tip + tax but Noah said forget it , he didn't care about that money.

Basically it was all too fucking complicated. I am fine with paying for Sarah as it is her bday but I am not ok with paying extra for other people and splitting it family style. I ended up paying about $25 extra.

The next time we went out, I could see it going down the road of the check being unfairly split if we just got one check. So I asked the waiter for separate checks. Noah and Beth got offended. I explained last time I overpaid and wasn't comfortable with that happening again. Beth made a face at me and said ""we all overpaid."" Noah became all indignant and said if I felt that way he would pick up the entire bill. He kept insisting and arguing with me but I ended up getting the separate checks.

AITA for spending $200 more on a gift than my husband allowed?,"I feel like this situation is ridiculous but here it is. My(28F) brother's (29M) birthday is coming up, and I wanted to get him a really cool gift since it's his 30th. I mentioned to my husband(49M) that I was going to go shopping for a present this afternoon and he told me to keep it under $200. I didn't really think about it much and went the store. I ended up finding an Xbox One X for $500. My brother has wanted one for ages and they're hard to find, and I knew he would be so happy if I got him this. So here's where I may be an asshole, I bought the Xbox. 

I came home and showed my husband and he was pretty pissed off. I tried to explain my reasoning but he just cut me off and said that since he's the one who works it's his money and I shouldn't have spent that much when he told me not to. I argued that it was something special and I wouldn't do it again, and that we have more than enough money that this won't even make a dent in our finances (which is true, hes a doctor and makes more than we need.)

He just kept yelling about how I don't work so I had no right to do that, which I think is a little unfair. He got pretty mean about it too.

He's barely talking to me now and I'm just sitting on the couch on Reddit while he occasionally glares at me. I get it's his money and I went overboard but I knew my brother would be really excited and I wanted to see him happy. 

So, am I the asshole here?

AITA for going back on a dog sitting agreement after the dog destroyed sentimental property?,"Our friends (husband M20 & wife F20) took a month long trip with someone else originally lined up to take care of their 1.5yo dog. After a week, the dog sitter quit because the dog was peeing in their house multiple times a day. The couple called me on FaceTime frantic asking if my husband (25M) & I (24F) could take care of their dog for the remaining 3 weeks. They put the blame of the indoor accidents on the dog sitter, saying that she’s not getting taken out enough or must be super stressed out in a house with kids & dogs. They guaranteed this wouldn’t happen at our home because the dog is potty trained and we have neither kids nor pets. We said yes because 1) they totally put us on the spot on FaceTime and 2) we felt bad for them considering they’ve told us we are their only friends in the country.

Well, the joke’s on us! Because as soon as we put their dog in our car … she peed. Thankfully it was on rubber mats so easy cleanup. The first 5 minutes in our house, she peed. Ok, maybe we’re stressing the dog out too much.. so we purposely act super calm around her, even tried avoiding eye contact with her because of stuff we had read online. Still peed in the house 3-5 times a day despite 3 walks a day & being given the “I need to go outside and potty” bell she was (apparently) trained with. After a week we’re losing our minds over the smell and frustration of the whole ordeal.

The final straw was that the dog managed to wiggle open a sliding closet door and chewed through 3 pairs of heels + other items of clothing. Out of all of the clothing items, the only item I was upset to see destroyed was my sentimental wedding heels. We had just gotten married 2 months prior, and I sold my wedding dress & veil afterwards to make the whole event more affordable.

We were at our wits end at this point and told them that they need to find another place for the dog for the last 2 weeks. They were not happy and pushed back, but reluctantly found a coworker who’d take her. We also tell them that we would like to be compensated for the $100 wedding heels (with no mention of being compensated for the other destroyed items, for the cleaning materials to remove the pee smell from our house, or for time spent dog sitting). They pushed back on this too, saying they were sorry but they weren’t financially responsible, but a day passed and they changed their minds/paid us.

Reasons we could be the assholes: We recognize that we initially said we would help, but then turned back on our word 1/3 of the way in. And we expected compensation for something they didn’t agree was reasonable (at first). We thought they’d eventually cool off and reach back out to us, but now it’s been a year of no-contact… it’s been bothering us a lot that they dropped us as friends, and it’s making us wonder if we are raging assholes in this scenario.

Additional info:
- The dog is a small sized general mutt breed. Not a working dog breed or “high energy” dog.
- They’ve had the dog since it was about 6 weeks old and this is the first time they’ve left her with someone else overnight. We know this because our country is a small-ish island, so it’s a big deal/your friends will know when you leave island. 
- Found out on day 8, when we insisted she needs to be boarded in a facility instead of sent to turn someone else’s house into a toilet, that they were behind on her shots/she couldn’t. 
- We “dog proofed” our tiny 700 sq/ft place to the best of our abilities, but the only closets/storage space had those sliding doors…",Not the A-hole

AITA for not letting my brothers dog in during winter,"Background-

I have had my dog since she was a puppy when I initially got her and as she grew I bought everything I needed even if it left me with no spending money after,Including a cage.She is a medium sized dog high energy dog with her cage giving her considerable leg room.My brother on the other hand took in a large long haired dog this summer and hasn’t bothered to buy her anything just insisting I share everything I bought for my dog in fear of spending his own money.I love his dog so I tolerated his behavior.

Here’s the issue,for months I’ve been telling him to buy her a cage so when the winter months approach she can sleep and rest inside since our mother doesn’t enjoy my brothers dog shedding all over.He refused to because of his cheapness and now that winter is here he insists his dog share my dogs cage because how could I refuse his dog shelter?

Here is where my family is saying im the asshole and overdramatic.I refused to let my dog share her cage,even though I do feel for his dog ,doing so would leave my dog crammed in her own cage.So my brother has no choice but to put her in the garage since its slightly warmer but still very cold.I think all animals deserve to have a warm home during winter but it is a responsibility my brother has been putting of for a while.

So AITA?

Update:After lots of nagging and convincing he let me her a makeshift bed in his room using my dogs old bed and some planks.He’s still complaining abt the shedding and is back talking me when i tell him he needs to take her outside for exercise but atleast his dog isnt stuck in the garage",Not the A-hole

He initially bought the toy but he said I should notice and stop him and I’m gonna be a bad mother and let our child eat things off the floor and choke on them, the vet called me for the updates etc and he’s mad bc he has to hear the info from me not the vet but I’m the one who’s here and take him so that’s why she calls me and he’s working so that’s a down side of him working away, it just is what it is, he called me useless and I’m the reason this is all happening, but I am doing my absolute best taking care of these dogs, being 7 months pregnant and taking care of the house and working still, I am doing my best.

WIBTA if I did not share some extra money with my wife?,"Morning all! I hope you are well

WIBTA if I did not share half of the money I received from selling two concert tickets and used it all for myself?

I had purchased some concert tix for a pretty popular artist awhile back, my wife did not want me to purchase them, she thinks splurging on concert tix is a waste of money, but it was my own money and while we're not super well-off we're not on the having to count every penny either. So she gave me a limit of how much I could spend. I said ok, and I bought 4 tickets within the range she gave me (albeit the high range) but they were good seats at a good price and I was stoked.

Of course I planned to use two of them for us and then sell the other two to pay for those tickets so I'd at least break even and I figured she'd be impressed with my financial prowess. Well at the time of purchase, we were also paying off a hefty hospital bill for our kid, but we were at the tail end of it and had a few payments left that equaled about the cost of one of the tickets and we agreed she would ""pay"" for her ticket by making the final payments on her own. Additionally, I arranged for the hotel and the flight to the venue that more than covered the remainder of my portion of the hospital bill but left it at that because I figured we would break even and it would just be a nice trip for us two.

Well, the remaining two tickets sold at a much higher price than I thought they would and I scored a pretty good chunk of change for them, I excitedly told my wife and we were chatting about it, she asked how much I made on them and I told her and her eyes went wide and she asked if she was going to get a piece of the pie. Now of course, I am going to splurge a little on us, give her some cash to do some fun things, but with the majority of this unexpected cash I had intended to pay down some bills but it kind of sounds like she wants one of the ticket's worth of the earnings. Her reasoning is with the sold tickets and the new money its as if I didn't pay for that last part of the hospital bill while she did and so therefore she deserves some of the money. My reasoning is, we had agreed to our agreement above and I had taken on the extra risk to purchase the additional tickets that she didnt participate in, in fact, she has been pressuring me to ""give"" the final two tickets to two of our friends at at least cost so they could come along with us but I stood firm, if I had sold OUR tickets then yea of course her reasoning would make sense.

What do yall think, WITBA if I didnt share more than I had intended on sharing with her and using the rest of the money for myself?",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I cut off all contact with my family without any prior notice?,"Note: I have NEVER used Reddit before, and it even took me about twenty minutes to figure out how to post on this sub bc I'm spiritually a grandma with no idea how to use technology. I only know about AITA bc of a Twitter acc dedicated to it.

Anyway, this ""conflict"" is one part of basically my whole life. A couple minor details have been changed to avoid anyone finding this and recognising me.

So, I (20F) come from a very old-fashioned and religious Indian family. I live in the UK and am in my penultimate year of uni. Originally, the plan was that I would stay at my uni and eventually go into research while working as a professor here.

This is where the conflict comes in. My family are now insisting that I soon get married. My mum is obsessed with the idea of me being a perfect religious housewife (when she says housewife, she means do all the housework and child-raising, and also have a flourishing career at the same time). In my family, not being married by 25 is a sign of failure.

This by itself is already a problem for me bc I'm NOT housewife material. In fact, my mum has infantilised me my whole life and not even taught me how to do basic things like cook and clean, in an attempt to avoid me becoming independent and leaving the family. She's only recently allowed me to learn things like that in order to prepare for marriage, despite making me feel like shit my whole life for not being able to do simple things.

Anyway, back to the marriage thing. I'm also a lesbian. So yeah, this is a trainwreck. My family doesn't know this about me and hopefully never will bc they're incredibly homophobic.

To get away from all this, I want to cut off all contact with my family and move to somewhere in Europe (I have international friends, savings and language abilities so that's not a problem). I wish there was an easier way to get away from them but when one of my relatives ran away when they were around my age, they sent a whole search party to find them and then got them married to a stranger within two weeks.

Another problem is that I'm feeling really guilty for this. My mum spent my whole life saving up so I could be the first in my family to go to uni (and she struggled to save anything up bc of my dad's spending habits). She sacrificed a lot for me by immigrating to a country where she couldn't speak the language and marrying someone she hates. She would be incredibly worried about the family's reputation if they had no idea where I was and if I was even alive. However, if I did tell them about it beforehand, it is guaranteed that they would coerce me into coming back in some way and I'd spend the rest of my life locked up in my room.

WIBTA for bringing a few of my own dishes to my fiance's family's Christmas gathering?,"This year, my fiance (26M) and I (27 human) got engaged, and I agreed to join him and his extended family for Christmas.

Only problem is the food. I used to have a very serious eating disorder, and was hospitalized (Anorexia w binge/purge). I've gotten over the worst, w/a few small slipups, and I still struggle with food, and count calories, BUT have not purged in 6 months (a big record for me!)

Going low-carb a few years ago REALLY helped me start to eat more normally, and not get triggered. I love food and cooking, and this diet, along with being more health conscious has allowed me to enjoy food/eating again, even if I still struggle, and I'm grateful for it.

I avoid too much sugar, & processed food & High Fructose Corn Syrup. I read food labels and try to avoid ANYTHING with unnecessary added sugar that isn't a dessert. I don't eat fast food, and don't eat bread, rice, or pasta, though since dating my fiance, I've loosened up a little, and occasionally will eat healthier carbs, (buckwheat, chickpeas, lentils). I do enjoy some treats and sweets, but it's important that they're made of good, real ingredients, and not processed, or generic storebought prepackaged treats. (I love baking, and am more comfortable eating my own homemade treats, because I know what's in them & the flavor is way better than storebought)

My fiance's family is more Standard American Diet, and Im worried there wont be much I can eat. His family eats pasta on XMas Eve, and most of the sides they have Xmas day are carby, or have sugar or processed ingredients, & storebought pie for dessert.

I don't want to be difficult, I never ask anyone to make anything special for me, but I'm NOT willing to give up my diet, even for one day. I don't want to be triggered. I also don't feel good if I eat too many carbs or processed food. (Get bloated, heavy, and gassy), and get really anxious & can't enjoy myself because I feel guilty, even if I resist purging. I also am very conscious of my health. My eating disorder damaged my health, and trying to be as healthy as possible going forward is very important to me.

I'm sure there will at least be a salad or some side dish there I can eat, & the main is meat, which is fine, but most sides, snacks, and desserts (storebought/processed) are things I wouldnt eat, and I want to enjoy my holiday meal, (and be able to have a dessert I'd like)

WIBTA if I brought a side dish and a homemade dessert that I know I could feel okay eating and enjoy? I would make enough for everyone, and bring them as a contribution to the meal.

I don't want to seem weird or rude, or offend his family, but I worry it would be rude to show up and not be willing to eat most of the food, and I don't want them to think they have to make anything special for me, or feel bad if there's nothing I can eat. I don't know if theyd think it rude if I brought some food, but it would be extra dishes for everyone, and would allow me to enjoy a special holiday meal and treat as well.

Thoughts?  


EDIT: MORE INFO

My SO is very understanding and supportive of my diet, and usually loves the low carb meals I cook, (low carb definitely doesn't mean not tasty or flavorful!) and is willing to order less/no carbs if we're eating out and splitting something. I do most of the cooking, because I enjoy it, (he cooks sometimes, but isn't a super confident or experienced cook, so oftentimes he'll ask me for a recipe, or he'll be willing to cook as long as I can instruct him how)  so he basically follows my diet unless we're eating out or going to an event or something. I'm fine with him eating what he wants if he's cooking for himself or we're going out, just I'm not really willing to cook food that might be triggering for me, and I'm a pretty good cook and love finding new recipes and coming up with my own, so he rarely has any complaints, beyond jokes about missing pasta every now and then. 

He's told me that his family is pretty attached to their traditions, and there's some 'traditional' family recipes that they always make. I get the impression that they may be sensitive or think I'm rude because of some of the stories he's told me (for example... His grandpa has a 'traditional' green bean casserole recipe that he always makes and is extremely proud of. There's another family member who makes a green bean casserole as well, that's BETTER than grandpa's, but people will go out of their way to make sure that both get eaten, in order to avoid offending grandpa, who's so attached to his recipe.)",Not the A-hole
AITA for Not Telling My Mum and Nan About My Italy Trip With My Dad Sooner?,"For context, my mum and I have a rocky relationship. I didn't live with her growing up so there is a canyon between us.

Furthermore, back in about September,  I told my mum off about telling Dad about some things I had been posting online that I didn't want him to find out about (basically just some pics of me with skimpy clothing). To his credit he had taken it very well and didn't tell me off. In response to my message asking her not to divulge such info to him, she said she ""won't be bothering with Xmas much this year as I will probably be going on holiday with Nan and the boys next year."" The boys are my brothers.

Nowadays, I have a much better relationship with my dad, and I missed out on Christmas with him as I was sick. Basically, I think he's lonely, and I want to create more happy memories with him.

Additionally, I have never been on holiday with either of my parents. Due to these factors I suggested to him why don't we go on holiday together? He suggested Rome and that's where we will be going, along with my fiance.

Now, I was especially nervous about breaking the news to my mum and nan. My mum and nan are obsessed with my dad, always slagging him off. Also, my mum didn't react well when she asked in response to my engagement last year on my birthday something along the lines of, ""who have you told first? Me or your dad?"" and when I told her the truth (my dad had managed to ring me just beforehand) she accused me of loving him more than her.
Based on this I did not think she would react well to me going to Italy with him. 

Unfortunately, my aunt who has been helping him plan a hotel to stay in told her we would be going to Italy (although, to her credit did leave out about us going with my dad).

My mum tried guilt-tripping me with how she can't afford holidays, how one day she will afford somewhere nice. Also tried guilt-tripping me about my sick uncle in Portugal (who I will go out to visit, but with his hospital appointments and having recently just moved, it's been tricky to work out when's best for him). I rang my nan yesterday as she recently had an operation, and she got it out of me that we're going with dad. I wasn't going to lie to them because they would find out anyway. She told mum (anything my mum knows my nan knows, and vice-versa). Now she's definitely hurt and giving me the silent treatment.

I gently as possible asked my aunt if she could not tell my mum things like this, as I was planning on doing so after it was booked. She hasn't reacted well to this and said some things like ""I won't take responsibility for how your mum and nan react"" (which to be honest is fair enough) and how she was ""so hurt after all the support I've given you through the years."" Now basically everyone is giving me the silent treatment. All I wanted was to set gentle boundaries with my aunt.

Maybe I should have asked my aunt not to say anything to my mum in the first place, but I didn't anticipate this would happen.

AITA for not eating because there wasn't enough,"My mother always hosts a Sunday dinner, and today she made me make these cheap chicken nuggets, she knows I don't like, and mac and cheese. I was just going to eat mac and cheese, but there wasn't enough so I just ate a small snack. She got mad at me for not saying that there wasn't enough, but I didn't want anyone else to go hungry.

Edit for info: I am 18. There were around 8 people, this was the only food because it was cheap and we have limited time between church services. I often get told to cook because she is helping look after my brother's kids. This was the first time we made this stuff for a big group and I thought we had enough until I was almost done serving it. The guests go back to church with us after the meal.",Not enough info
AITA for commenting on a customer's stink in public?,"Board game store. This should be enough info for the thread but I'll elaborate.

Customer, Jennifer (not real name), is in every Friday for MtG. It's a big public event about 3-4hr. We get around 40 people. I just work the store during these hours, I'm not involved in any of the events, but where I work is directly adjacent to where Jennifer usually sits.

She has bad BO. I dealt with it for four weeks before I asked my manager if we could put up signage ""This is a public area and as such we expect customers to adhere to basic hygiene protocols."" So we did, but nothing changed.

So three weeks ago I pull Jennifer aside covertly and out of earshot of others and asked if she saw the new signage. She said yes. I told her this is starting to be a problem and if she could rectify the problem. She said yes.

Last Friday, after weeks of zero change, I thought it was enough and if it wasn't going to stop in private, I'd make sure it stopped in public. So I reminded her about our talk, in full earshot of many people. I didn't whisper, either, it was my normal talking voice. I told her that we take hygiene very seriously and if she can cooperate with us, it would be just great, thanks. She stormed out of the store in tears.

Did I go too far? This is months of dealing with it, trying to deal with it without singling her out, then privately singling her out, and now publicly signing her out. 

A friend said it was insensitive because I don't know Jennifer's situation, but she's is in her late 20s and doesn't appear to be disabled. She's not overweight, seems ""normal"" enough. If she's playing Magic, she can afford the basic shower accoutrements. I don't think that's an excuse.",Not the A-hole
AITA for wanting back my $48 that I loaned a former classmate?,"In May 2022 I let my friend buy something with my money, because he claimed his parents took his money from him. His total was $48 which was more than I expected. He said he could pay me back in a month or so. I was fine with that. It ended up being longer, but we were in the same class and this started during our first year, so I knew we had one more year together where I could get updates from him regarding this.

This year, he ended up leaving the class about 1/4th of the way through the year, without paying me back. He still knew that he owed me money and was updating me on paying it back before he left. After that, he didn’t reach out about it and I let it go because I wanted to give him time to adjust. He stayed in a group chat from that class and later asked if people wanted to hang out at a place that had something he wanted. I took this to mean he got his money back so I texted him about it and asked if he could pay me back in cash. He said that his parents still hadn’t given him his money. I replied and told him that I took the text to mean he had money to spend since he mentioned specific products, and that this was going on longer than I was okay with. He said he wasn’t feeling that well and would rather talk about it later, so I let it go again.

Later, I texted him back and asked if telling his parents about this would help, and I restated that I would be willing to go to his house and that I had the original receipt if his parents would like to verify this. He said that his parents were more worried about his mental health and that if I had PayPal he MIGHT be able to pay me back at some time later. I do not have PayPal.

Now, during that time he was active on social media and posted about getting things that required money from either him or his parents. One thing was a fursuit head base, which was listed on Etsy for $50. He said his parents bought it for him. I texted him about seeing the stuff he’d been getting, and in that text I said that if this situation was too much for his mental health I would be happy to contact his parents about it directly if he gave me contact info. He asked me to stop reading so deep into things and apologized for my “hurt feelings and misunderstanding,” but didn’t apologize for not being able to pay. He said that his parents want me to stop contacting him because everything from the class he left was hurting his mental health, even though the message only came two minutes after when I offered to talk to the parents directly. I think that’s not enough time to type and send a text after talking to his parents about what I said.

I haven’t responded yet, but I got his dad’s phone number from another classmate and am considering messaging the dad about everything. I’m not sure if that’s going too far. He’s claimed before that his parents aren’t supportive of him and his hobbies but he also claimed that his parents literally bought him the fursuit head base.

AITA For Asking if My Moms on Meth?,"For some background info, I live in the basement of my 21f, Aunt 39f home. Originally my Aunt had moved to another property and I was allowed to live there rent free as long as I paid utilities and kept the home cared for. This was the agreement until January when she moved back in with her family, I now pay $400 to live there along with rules like not being in the kitchen from 3-8pm, not being allowed upstairs with my dog, and no longer allowed to park in the two car garage because she leaves her dogs in there. I’m nc with my mom/stepdad due to abuse. 

Okay so onto the story. 

 Sunday afternoon I woke up to a message from my aunt that said, “I’ve been informed that your moms on meth”. I immediately panicked because I have 4 younger sisters living still with my mom and stepdad, they are abusive and have had multiple CPS visits but not enough evidence has ever been found. I immediately messaged my aunt asking what was going on and never got a reply back after an hour so I messaged my sister 17f  instead. 

I asked her if she was safe and if everything was okay to which she replied yes and asked me what was going on when I pressed to make sure that was true. I sent her a screenshot of the text of my aunt saying my mom was on meth when she asked why I was asking and asked my sister again if she was really certain that things were okay. My sister reassured me my mom wasn’t on meth and asked me what was going on with our aunt and I told her I had no idea. 

I don’t hear anything else for the next few hours and when I step outside with my dog my aunt is there and immediately starts yelling at me, asking me, “Why are you trying to start shit? I’m only trying to help you and you want to start shit while you live in my house?” I asked her what she was talking about and my aunt explains that my mom and her mom have been blowing up her phone, asking her where she heard that rumor and if her dad told her that. I told her she should just tell them where she heard the rumor from and that I wasn’t trying to start shit, I only asked my sister what was going on, if she was safe and when questioned, mentioned that she had told me. My aunt then said, “Well that’s none of their damn business where I heard it from and I bet your mom is on meth, that’s why she’s so damn crazy” at this point I just excused myself and went back inside to my room. 

I went to work that night and came home in the morning, showered, and went to bed. I put my phone on the charger and underneath my pillow, I woke up at 11:30am this morning, checked my phone and decided it was too early since I fell asleep at 9:30am and went back to bed. I woke up a few hours later feeling like I had missed my alarm and my phone wasn’t on the charger and it wasn’t underneath my pillow. It was at the foot of my bed, face up and fully charged.

I then told her she wasn’t going to the show since she had been off today. She got upset and begged saying she would go in tomorrow and if she could go. She also admitted to faking being sick to get out of her speaking assessment at school. It is also maybe important to not we think she may have anxiety so that might be why she skipped. I told her no, and she is grounded for a week. The tickets were in her fathers name and he still wants her to go but I have put my foot down and said no.

AITA for not cleaning the mess I didn’t make?,"So short disclaimer, technically speaking this is a “will I be the asshole?” Because I haven’t done it yet. But basically, I work at a flea market with concession stands. Technically I’m a floater, and go wherever I’m needed, but most of the time I’m running out sweets concession stand. When I first started, I was taking the trash out every day, because, well, that was the logical thing to do! But after a few weeks of working there, a superior asked me why I was taking out the trash! I was then informed that this was actually the job of the maintnance employees, and to stop doing it because I’m “taking aspects of their job away from them”. No problemo boss! I quit taking the trash out. It really didn’t matter to me either way, as long as it got done. So, for the past few months, I’ve been leaving the trash for the Maintnance employees to take out, and (because it’s their job) it’s almost always done. Except for this weekend. I came into work today, and got a call from my boss. He said I was going to be in admissions today since several people called out, but he also wanted to talk to me about the “condition” of my booth. He proceeded to yell at me about how since I hadn’t taken out the trash, rats had gotten in it and scattered the trash everywhere and made a mess. I reminded him that he had told me not to take out the trash, and how he had told me I was taking others jobs away from them by doing so. his voice softened a little bit, but he didn’t say anything. I could tell he realized his fuck up, but he still ignored me and glazed over it. He wasn’t yelling anymore, but he did tell me that I was expected to stay late and clean up “my” mess. I think this is absolutely fucking ridiculous. If he wants me to deal with the trash on a day to day basis, FINE! I don’t care. It literally doesn’t make a difference to me. If I had left it there when it was my job to take it, of course it would be my mess, and I’d have no problem cleaning it! But to explicitly tell me NOT to touch the trash, and then yell at me for not doing it? This is not my mess. The way boss man has this set up, it’s the maintenance employees mess.

AITA for asking my first grandson to move out?,"I (67m) have, up until about 3 months ago, been providing my first grandson, who I'll refer to as Jim (24m) with free housing for the better part of 4 years. He moved in during mid to late 2018 to help out my then wife of over 40 years (85F) due to her health issues and my long work hours. Despite my wife having died in 2019, he continued to live with me for free. Not only did I provide him with free housing for numerous years, but I also allowed him to bring over his girlfriend (21f) from the states for university, and provided her with housing thusly.

A few months ago Jim bought her an engagement ring for about £76 (He asked a friend to make it via 3D printer so it's worth more in sentiment that in money) despite having no line of employment and being on benefits. He also took himself and her out to a restaurant to celebrate, which was attended by the following:

My stepdaughter (66f) and her husband (60m)  
My long-time close friend and stepson (62m) and his wife (58f)  
My stepdaughter's daughter \[not sure what the correct term is\] (32f)  
My only biological daughter (42f)  
My second grandson (15M)  
My third grandson (9m)  
My daughter's friend (32f) and her daughter (6f)

After my wife died, I got into a relationship with a long-term friend of the family (68f) who we'll refer to as Val. Val was a close family friend whom many of us had known for upwards of 20 years. My daughter does not deal well with change a lot of the time and was not happy with our relationship, as was my Jim. When I asked if we could attend I was told I would be fine to attend, but bringing Val along with me would be, and I quote ""A bit weird"" since nobody there really knew her that well. After learning of this and also learning of the info that despite this stricture, my daughter's friend would be attending despite the fact I know for sure nobody there knew her, I'd had enough. Neither Jim nor his girlfriend do any cleaning around the house, neither are employed, and both spend the money they get off benefits (and also sometimes me when in ""dire straits"") on materialistic rubbish with no legitimate practical purposes.

About a week after their night out to help soften the blow, I indirectly asked them to move out. Keep in mind I did not give them a direct ultimatum, I simply suggested that *at least one of the two of them* either get into a line of employment, clean up around the house or find their own place to stay. And with no place to stay or line of employment, their logical solution to this situation was to move out ASAP. After this happened they also alienated me from my daughter (42F) as she fervently supports them and already has a slightly weak relationship with both my other grandsons. As far as I know, from what little I've heard from them and of them, they've been couch surfing ever since, with neither of them attempting to find employment or even any sort of bedsit to stay at short-term.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling a new mother that her husband sent me crude pics?,"I’m conflicted. A totally random dude from a different state requested me on insta. It was his personal page and a private profile. His picture was with his pregnant wife and his caption was #father #husband. I accepted his request out of curiosity and requested a follow back. He accepted right away so I checked out his profile. Normal dude - tons of pics celebrating his new son and loving tributes to his wife. Then this happens:

I get another request from a brand new account that looks EXACTLY LIKE this guy. He DMs me telling me I’m beautiful and sends topless pics. I refer back to the other Instagram to make sure it’s the same dude (cuz wtf?) and confirm the tattoos are the same. Apparently he’s really dumb bc I ask him if his wife would like him sending me crude pics and he plays dumb. I then proceed to send him a pic of HER insta account with a pic of him in it. He then begs me not to say anything to her. I’ll spare you the details but by that point he had already sent me dick pics (and a video with his face in it). I wanted to see how far he would go, and he went there.

I proceeded to block him but I really feel weird now. His wife probably has no idea that she has a shitty ass husband. Her instagram is allll about him and says how perfect he is. But I feel like it’s not my place to shake things up for them. If he keeps being dumb, which he seems awfully good at, she will find out soon enough. Right? Otherwise, I have plentiful screenshots to send her which should give her enough info to determine her husband is out to cheat on her (or already is).

AITA for not letting my parents watch me send in my college applications?,"INFO: I (17F) just finished college applications. It has been an insanely rocky experience. I attend boarding school and have been doing the college process mostly alone. My parents haven't really tried to be involved in the rough parts of the application, which was surprising to me, as they are usually more helicopter-y. I was more grateful for this than anything, and I am capable of managing myself.

Now, for the actual situation. I was planning on finishing my applications and sending them in (10 total) before my Christmas break. I am a very schedule-based person, so having a date to finish by helps ease my anxiety. The date was set for five days before Christmas break. On the day of said date, my parents reached out to me requesting to know my reasoning behind my college choices. I was more than happy to oblige and communicated my interests. They did not think this was enough, however, and requested I wait until I was home to send in the applications. I was upset by this, but ultimately, it isn't my decision, as they are paying the application fees. I ran through it and gave my reasoning for every college, but they said that it wasn’t “deep enough”.

Ultimately, it was a week after my planned application date when I applied. This really upset me, as I said, I basically run on schedules. I ended up finishing the application process alone, and my parents left me alone eventually, agreeing to still pay the application fees.

It came to the day when I was all ready to send in my apps, and DUDE the absolute excitement I felt. I mentioned at breakfast that I would be sending them in that day, and they got very excited to “send them in with me”. I said that I was actually planning to go out to a coffee shop and do it on my own, since I had done the rest of the process on my own. They got very upset and said that they deserved to be there with me. I stood my ground, but they didn’t let it go. My reasoning was that since they weren’t around for the hard part of the process, they don’t (for lack of a better word) deserve to be there for the happiest/most rewarding part.

They do this a lot, too. They avoid the difficult part of things, leaving me to fend on my own, then try and wedge their way back in during the payoff like nothing ever happened. Anyways, I ended up sending them in by myself, and they’re really upset that I didn’t stay at home. While it felt really good, and I felt really proud of myself, I still feel guilty, because this is a (presumably) once-in-a-lifetime event and they’re my parents. They still agreed to pay, but have been super passive-aggressive with me, I think because I haven’t apologized. AITA?

ETA: This is a very important thing to me. I failed out of my freshman year, and attended hospitals+residential programs for the rest of it, as well as some of my sophomore year. I (along with my family) never thought that graduating high school was even plausible, so it is a very big step for me (and in my mental health!) to not only be planning for graduation, but also applying to colleges. They did very little to aid in my making up credits or attending therapy (most of the time they are no-shows) and disregard my mental health almost completely. They understand the importance of this step, but pick and choose when to show up for me.

SECOND ETA: I'll keep this short. They do not pay for my boarding school, it is paid by my school district as part of an IEP plan. They avoided helping me with the tedious or grueling parts of applications, such as: weeding out colleges, filling out the common app, writing my essay, the supplemental essays, etc. They have only been interested in the ""sending the apps in"" bit. They pretty much ignored me for everything else.",Not the A-hole
AITA - Friend demands share of profit 5 years after I bought something from him?,"My friend was moving house 5 years ago and had 6 old chairs and a dining table he couldnt keep. I had a look at them, seemed OK - a bit old and used, so I offered £50 for the lot.

He said something like ""I was actually going to throw them out.LOL. You've saved me the hassle!"". I did think ""Shouldnt have said £50!!"" - but I thought a deals a deal so paid £50. I organised man with a van to collect and deliver then emailed him to say thanks for helping get everything into the van, happy with purchase, and saved me paying for first hand dining set. He replied saying no probs, glad they've got a new home. End of story.

Fast forward 5 years and I'm moving house myself. New place too small for huge table & chairs so need to sell. I find info on underside of table. Take lots of pics and email loads of places nearby asking for price to purchase. Within an hour I get 3 replies. They all want to inspect furniture and assess. By end of the week I get 3 offers and highest is £1500!!! Apparently once restored theyll be worth a lot more. Jackpot!

I post saying house move goin to plan etc then add in the great news that I scored £1500 jackpot selling my old table and chairs.

Later that night my mate messages me in a RAGE!! First half is just abuse, but second half reads ""I'm demanding half the money from the sale of my table and chairs. I only gave them to you to look after. I didnt sell them to you. I'm happy to agree to half since you've had them in storage in your house. If you've been using them fair enough. But I'm not happy you're selling them because I didnt agree to that. My bank details are ******. Transfer me £750 by the end of the week and I'll call it quits. If money isn't received I'm going to small claims court and also police to report that you're selling my property""

I reply ""I literally bought these from you? Are you insane??I even have an email where I thanked you helping to get the furniture into the van. I also say you saved me money buying a dining set first hand!""

He replies ""So this is how you thank me 5 years later? Making huge profit from a mate? If I'd known how much it was worth do you seriously think I'd have sold to you for £50? You're 2 faced. I'm goin to go to small claims court""

I reply ""You just said you sold to me for £50!!!LOL. That's my point. You literally SOLD to me. I didnt know they were worth that much when I bought them. The fact is I bought it from you fair and square. End of discussion""

The last reply I have is ""At the very least I want my fair share. Why is money so important to you? Are you that greedy? Give me £500 and that leaves you with £1000. If you dont do that then I know exactly type person you are. I'll tell people as well mate. Do you honestly want people knowing that you did this to a mate?? The balls in your court""

I'm really losing my mind about this. Am I the one who's wrong here? Should I share the profit to save face? AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for not wanting my husband’s family over for special events?,"F(37) and my husband is (41) and I have tense relationship with his family, loads of stuff has happened within the 7 years we have been together,  and the final straw came when his brother totally ruined a surprise party I threw for my husband not only did he nearly start a physical fight with my dad but also went to attack my dog! And he thought my dog was aggressive (my dog isn’t). Previous to this his sister in law shouted out at our wedding as we were getting introduced as Mr and Mrs how his brother was better than him ( my husband) his sister was doing drugs and was totally out of it insulted my guests and one of his cousins threw a glass at the reception. ( I was totally unaware of this as my bridesmaid and mother tried to shield me form this)  another time at my daughter 2nd birthday I invited all of his family and not one of them got her a gift or card and decided to turn it into a party and not a kids party! 
I made an excuse over the Xmas period that was I busy and tired to host this year as I had been working so much? But I have a few things coming up and I don’t know how I can make an excuse again,
I have explained all this to my husband and he says that is his family?? But I get so upset when they are around and so stressed worried what they will do next??",Not the A-hole
AITA for limiting my daughter's time at my parent's house?,"Little bit of background: I'm the oldest (25F) of 4 kids and had both of my parents(45F and 43M) growing up (so thankful for them). I didn't have a rough or bad childhood or anything like that. I grew up in a military family and have always been close to my family. My parents always talk about how important family is and how we need to be there for each other when someone needs it. As I got older, I did realize how certain things and reactions that my parents gave were a bit toxic and just overall not okay. Like one thing they insist on is that my marriage could be better and compare it to theirs. I don't know what their problem is with my husband(25M) and while we do have our problems, he's amazing in everyway and I adore and love him so much and he feels the same way about me no doubt. We were living with my parents up until a serious argument (about my husband) and I was tired of hearing it so we decided to move into our own apartments.

On to the story, my husband and I have a 11 month old daughter (who is the absolute sweetest little girl) that my mom looks after when I go to classes (mondays for 3 hours and Wednesdays for 5). The reason I came up with the schedule is because they were complaining that they don't get to see her very often because I work full time from home and school. So my husband, parents and I talked agreeing that I would drop off my daughter at my parents so that my mom would spend more time with her. Now she and my dad are complaining that my husband needs to take more responsibility with my daughter and watch her while I go to school. They called him lazy and a bad dad for dropping the child care on my mom since he doesn't want to do anything (which is not true). I'm not sure what happened or what changed. I normally talk to them everyday and I always ask beforehand if it's okay to drop my daughter off but it just seems like these comments and reactions are coming out of nowhere. I'm not looking for answers but more advice if im the asshole. I try not to overwhelm my parents because they did their time with us but they always talk about wanting to spend more time with my daughter too. Now my parents are only going to see her every Saturday and maybe Sunday instead of Mondays, Wednesday and Saturdays. I feel like they are going to turn on me again saying that I'm taking away their grandkid when it's not that at all. I'm just tired of them talking crap about my husband and marriage like they see everything. 

So aita for doing this?

TL:DR: parents are upset with my husband because he doesn't ""take responsibility"" for my daughter but also complain that they don't see my daughter. So to avoid anymore arguments, I'm only taking my daughter to see them on the weekends instead of couple times during the week and weekends.

Update: Thank you for all the comments and advice everyone. Just wanted to add a little more info since I didn't fully explain why my parents my not like my husband. My husband doesn't have a job or goes to school. He does get disability which pays for diapers, groceries, rent, water, trash, renters and car insurance. My parents have always like the more traditional view of mom stays home and cares for baby while dad works but I enjoy working. I love my job. It's easy, good benefits and I get paid well considering I don't have my degree yet. I also go to school full time so while I'm doing homework or studying, my husband takes over watching her so I can do what I need to do. No matter how many times I tell them that I am happy with where I am with life, they always circle back to my husband not stepping up and being a good dad or father.

Upate to the situation: I told my mom and dad that if they want my husband to take more responsibility then he will be caring for our daughter when I attend classes Mondays and Wednesdays. They reacted exactly how I thought they would. They claim that I'm taking away their granddaughter and that my husband and I are punishing them and that I'm always on my husband's side or insisting that I can't think for myself. In response I told them that I'm done with them bashing on my husband and to stop trying to make me choose between them and my husband because in that situation, I'm choosing my husband. My dad texted me later saying that he was done with me and that he can't believe I'm doing this and that he hopes I'm happy that I made my mom cry. I honestly don't know what they want from me but if he says he's done then he lost a daughter and his granddaughter. I'm so tired of the fighting and bickering about whether or not my husband is good enough. He is more than good enough for me and it's about that damn time I realized that enough will never be enough for them and to just focus on my husband and daughter (I know I need to be a better wife to my husband). My parents aren't talking to me anymore and I don't intend to talk to them unless they apologize then hopefully we can sit down and talk about things. I'm not letting them run over me anymore.",Not enough info
AITA for having vegan food at my wedding?,"Throwaway account because I am a coward ;)

I (27F) just married my wife (29F) a little over a month ago.

We are both big fans of a local vegan restaurant, and have become friends with the owners over the years. I have a lot of digestive issues due to some health problems (they're a big part of why I went vegan in the first place) so we knew we wanted to ask them to cater our wedding as they have always been so considerate of my restrictions.

The food was a big hit, all fall-themed as the wedding was early November, so a lot of mushrooms, apples, corn, etc. Since our friends gave us a discount on the catering as a wedding gift, my wife and I were able to invite a lot more relatives than we thought, one of these being her uncle, Mark (not real name).

She's not *super* close with Mark, but they get along well enough. About a week ago, I was talking with Mark and his wife, Leah (not real name) who asked me about the catering at the wedding. Apparently the whole family really liked it, and they were interested in hiring the restaurant for a Christmas party or something.

I gave them the contact info and figured that would be it, but not two days later, my wife got a pretty angry text from her grandmother saying that we ""caused an argument"" between Mark and Leah, because Mark got upset about us ""tricking him into eating vegan food"" and Leah said it wasn't a big deal and he should get over it, so they had a fight.

I'm inclined to agree with Leah here, but my wife is upset because her grandmother is upset, and now I'm not sure. I have autism, so normally I would follow my wife's lead on stuff like this, but I really think Mark and her grandmother are being unfair. AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for talking back to my mom because she’s too hard on me while I’m trying to grieve?,"Okay, before I tell you this story I feel it’s important to give some context. A few days ago my cat passed away, the other passed a few days before that. The second, Tedje, had to be put to sleep. Yes, it was incredibly hard on me to see the life drain out of her while she was cuddled up on my lap, but she had been ill for a while so I got the chance to say goodbye before she passed. My other cat however, Boef, is a completely different story. I came home to an empty house, except for him. He came running up to the backyard fence to greet me like he always did, but then while hanging my coat up I suddenly heard him scream. I ran over and he was laying on the ground, panting, obviously in completely shock. I called my dad in completely panic to tell him to come home because our cat was dying. He stopped breathing pretty quickly. I shook him and begged him to get up, but obviously he didn’t. Then I just spent the next 30 minutes it took my dad to get home softly petting him and “comforting” him despite my panic, even though I knew he was already dead. 

I’m telling you all of this to emphasise how fucking traumatised I am. I know the world won’t stop for me just because my cats passed away and I definitely don’t expect it to, I just do need some time to deal with my trauma aside from all the work I’m doing. 

This is where the conversation with mom today comes in. 

So, my parents have this after school/tutoring business. I go there a few times a week to either study or help them. Today is one of those days. I was sitting in my dad’s office, trying not to cry before starting my work up. That’s when my mom walked in. She started off by asking if I had asked one of my teachers about an exam. I told her that I had forgotten. I admitted that it was incredibly stupid and that I should’ve thought about. I also apologised. Then I told her I’d immediately send my teacher a message to ask for the info. She was still clearly upset about it and this set her off. She told me how I need to get better grades and how I’m not doing enough. This hurt me. Last exam week I got *amazing* grades. I also feel it’s important to note that I’ve never been a bad student and get amazing grades very frequently. At this point she got visibly pissed and told me I need to do better and work harder, because lately I’ve been slacking too much. I got upset and told her this “Yeah, mom. You’re right, the last few days I *have* been slacking. Both my cats just died and I feel AWFUL. You and dad are way better at handling it, but I need some time to give it a place mom. I’m not strong like you and dad. Every time I’m not around you guys it’s because I’m crying mom. I’m trying as hard as I can, don’t you see that? I’m doing as much as I can. I’m sorry if that’s not enough for you but right now this is all I can give.” At this point I could feel tears coming up way too quickly so I got up and left the office to go study.

AITA for not allowing my friend to change a rule that we all already established?,"I’m a new Redditor to this subreddit, so I apologize if there are any errors. 
The other day, me and a couple of friends were playing a card game the our friend, Rachel (fake name) had brought. One thing that is necessary to know here, is that Rachel most likely has DID, or something along those lines, and it is clear they are not faking it. One of the alternatives that they have, we’ll call them Sarah, is much more emotional than Rachel, and can get upset much more easily. It is important in this story, as apparently a majority of this conversation was when Sarah was fronting (we didn’t know of this). 

It was a rather intense round, but we all were laughing while yelling at each other though, so it was a fun time. Then Sarah while grinning, proceeded to slam down a card, and make a move the we decided to not allow, since it wasn’t fair. I had tried to do it in the past and everyone, including her, said no. The rest of us immediately protested against this, and it started a rather heated debate, that most of us were laughing during (it’s a game). When I stated that “ hey I wasn’t allowed to do that before when I was trying to do it” they quickly responded with “do you seriously care that much about a past game that much?”. We ended up not allowing it, and we figured that it was just a funny, but heated debate we had. 

After all of us got home, however, Sarah sent us all a screenshot, saying that what they were trying to do was a fair play, on the game’s official page. We all kind of assumed that this was all in a light hearted manner, and was responding sarcastically. However, they BLEW UP. They called us “sore losers” and said “you all jumped in to try and prove that I’m stupid”. We never did such a thing, so we were all confused. We finally realized it was Sarah talking to us instead of Rachel, and after a while, we finally managed to get Rachel talking to us. 

All of us never said anything hostile, and only responded with really calm responses. Rachel started dming only me, and they still didn’t really understand why we weren’t allowing that play, especially since it was allowed on the official site. I explained that it was just how we played before, and to us it felt like cheating, and this conversation kept going back and forth. Eventually Sarah stepped in to the conversation again, and said that I should stop manipulating Rachel since I know they always say yes to everything. After that I decided to end the conversation since it was going nowhere. 

At the time I felt that I was in the right, but now I’m not so sure, as what they said is true, and it may just be my pettiness that is not allowing it to happen. Also it may have been our fault as 3 people, were arguing against 1 person and that may not have been fair. This isn’t the first time Sarah has thought really negatively about me, and so I’m worried I’ve done something wrong.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my teenage nieces that they need to adjust their expectations?,"My sister is a mom of three. My nephew is 18 and my nieces are 16 and 14. My sister's husband also has two older kids from his first marriage. They were closer in age to me (I'm 30 now) than to their half siblings. Both of my stepsisters stepkids ran as soon as they could and cut off all contact with the family. I remember when we were younger, they hated that their dad remarried and were never interested in being big siblings to my nephew and nieces. My nephew has the most memories of them and doesn't care to ever try and have a relationship with them but my nieces have longed for their older siblings for years and my sister and her husband have lied to them about the reason their siblings are not around, have lied and claimed they left messages for their little sisters so they'd know they loved them and told them once they were old enough they could look for them. Apparently both being at least 14 was old enough in their eyes so they let them start trying to reach out. The girls even paid someone on the internet to track down their info (FB profiles, email address and even home address). The girls attempted to reach out to both half siblings and were ignored and then blocked. They attempted to email them and also got no reply.

I told my sister and her husband they needed to reign them in before the girls try and show up at their front doors and get them slammed in their faces or told to fuck off. They told me it wouldn't get that bad. That nobody can shut kids out like that. I pointed out that they already had, when they walked away initially and when they blocked them on social media and ignored all correspondence from them.

Once the girls started to talk about getting their brother to drive them the 20+ hours to where their half siblings live, I made the decision to talk to the girls. I suggested they needed to adjust their expectations since their older siblings had ignored and blocked them. I told them they might want to give it some more time. They said they wanted to see them now. They also shared some of the lies their parents made up about what these siblings said (they will always have a home with them, they were their precious little sisters and were always wanted and had been prayed for, that they believed their mom sent them from heaven for the two of them). Now I know those two never said those things. I remember hearing the stuff they said about my nephew and nieces, about my sister, about their dad for remarrying. There was never any love there.

I told the girls I really hoped they would take what I said into consideration. They asked me why, when they knew they were waiting. I wanted to tell them everything but held back. Apparently me reminding them before I left to adjust their expectations stayed with them and they started to question their parents and now my sister and her husband are coming from me saying I had no business saying what I did to them.

AITA for refusing to stop saying my mother kidnapped my son?,"Firstly sorry this is on mobile and throwaway.

I (F32) emigrated to my husband’s (39) home country 5 years ago and we have a beautiful son who is 3. 

My mother (52) has always been controlling and frankly is a typical narcissist. She was dead against my moving and was even more upset when I had my son as a combination of her husband being terminally ill and the pandemic she wasn’t able to meet my son until this week and she has complained bitterly how we “cheated” her out of her special time with her first grandson. 

I wasn’t exactly excited about her coming to visit us but my husband convinced me we should try to let our son have a relationship with her. Well from the moment she arrived she complained - our house is too small, the garden is over looked etc. She complained my son doesn’t speak much english and so she can’t communicate with him. She complained that my son didn’t want to hug her, that he wanted to stay with his paternal grandmother.

My son spilt a drink and she shouted at him. We are taking the gentle approach so I told her not to do that and why and she lost it telling me I have no idea how to raise a kid. I told her she needs to respect my methods or she can leave. She stopped but the whole rest of the day you could tell she was furious.

That night my son was having one of those nights where he just isn’t going to sleep through. My poor husband also had an IBS flare up in the early hours and we realised we had no medication.

When my son settled at around 7:30am I decided to do a quick run to the 24hour pharmacy to get some medication. Leaving son and husband both asleep on the sofa.

I was gone for 20mins but when I came back my mother’s rental car was gone and so was my son while my husband was still asleep. He was as shocked as I was they had gone.

Tried my mother’s mobile but no answer. After 45mins of me becoming increasingly hysterical I called the police who came out very fast and when I explained as above took things seriously.

6hours later my mother pulled back up and started telling the police (most adults know english here) that I had told her she could take my son out for the day, I am currently 6 months pregnant and she said it must be pregnancy brain which the police seemed to accept and acted like the matter was closed since my son was home safely and showing everyone the toys he been bought. 

I told my mother to leave and that I never want to see her again. She started telling family I kicked her out for no reason and she can’t find a hotel and they blew up my phone to which I told them she had kidnapped my son and I am going to pursue this with the police.

Now I am being called an a-hole for saying my son was kidnapped when he was “just taken on a day trip by his loving grandmother” and that a accusation like this could affect my mother’s job as a nurse.

Edit - lots of people saying my husband shouldn’t have pushed for this meeting. You are right but I don’t think he was wrong. He didn’t force me to agree to it, I ultimately had the final say. 

And I get it he is (we are) lucky his parents are amazing so despite knowing my mother isn’t great he didn’t want our son to miss out. We expected some snide comments and awkwardness but were ready to ignore that for our son. Since my mother’s normal weapon of choice is nasty comments he wouldn’t understand so if we kept smiling he wouldn’t know.

I feel grief that my son is going “miss out” on having another grandmother but she made her bed.

Edit 2 (holy s**t is this real life) So she is now trying to change the narrative to “I did not kidnap your son but also if you think your husband could just sleep through an abduction then your marriage is a sham/how could you be so reckless to leave your child with him@

I can not even with this.


Update (of sorts) thank you everyone for the support. It seems maybe I got a bit lost in my translation (emotional and the police spoke native language and very fast with strong accents) the case isn’t exactly dropped. 

They have spoken to my mother and basically told her not to approach the house or they will consider it a threat/harassment and will act while they “continue investigating” but they feel her leaving the country tomorrow is enough of a resolution (apparently she has shown ticket info).

I am still getting a lot of grief from family saying I should understand my mother is struggling after her husband died and so on….this again is making me question my reaction but I can’t forgive this. 

I will reach out relative embassies but I feel like nothing will happen.

AITA for telling my boyfriend he's not allowed to eat in front of the neighbour's kid unless he's willing to share?,"My boyfriend made himself a plate of leftover Chinese for lunch today. At the time we had the neighbour's kid over to play with our kids. The neighbour's kid asked if he could have some too. My boyfriend said no and ate his plate of food. The kid is 5, when I heard this story it broke my heart. I told my boyfriend in the future to either send the kid home first, or only eat what he's willing to share with him. My boyfriend thinks he should do whatever he wants in his own home, regardless of whos over. He also said if it was one of our kids that asked he would of course share. He doesn't like the neighbour's kid and feels feeding him isn't our responsibility. AITA for expecting him to share or at the very least send him home so he isn't eating in front of him? Thank-you.

Edited to add- there was enough to give the kid his own plate. I wasn't expecting my boyfriend to share his actual plate with the kid. Also, I wasn't home at the time.

Second edit- I have asked his mom about allergies, he has none. I wouldn't feed someone's child without that info. Also, he comes from a rough home. He's been in and out of foster care and his mom's income is disability, they don't have much. Also, I work at a foodbank, food sensitivity is near to my heart so maybe I'm extra sensitive.

Third edit- I wasn't home to offer the kid food and we definitely have a lot of snacks on hand for sharing.

Fourth edit- I wasn't home as I had stepped out to run to the store. Boyfriend said it was OK. I was gone 30 minutes, max.

AITA for buying myself flowers when my husband told me it bothers him?,"Things have been tough at home, I won’t deny.  Anyhow, this one makes so little sense to me, I’m hoping someone can help me see if I am, indeed, the a$$hole.
During the pandemic (and ever since, too) I (53F) had to go in to the office every weekday, and I got into the habit of buying myself inexpensive grocery-store flowers about 2x a month to brighten up my desk. About a year ago he (52M) told me he hated that I buy myself flowers, because he should be buying me flowers. I honestly thought he was joking, but I told him he can ALWAYS buy me flowers, and left it at that.
This past week I was particularly happy with my choice of stems & my arranging skills, and since it’s a long weekend & I still wanted to enjoy them, I brought them home. 
Tonight after dinner he asks, “who bought you those?” and I joked, “my best friend and biggest fan - ME!”
And I kid you not, he was livid. Like, he really believes I should not buy myself flowers. He somehow thinks … I dunno … I’m buying flowers to make him feel bad??!!  I tried to tell him again that he can always buy flowers, there is no such thing as too many, and that my buying flowers to enjoy at work has NOTHING to do with him. But he started raising his voice and getting really angry, saying this has been going on for a long time and this is just another example of how I make him feel “less than”. 
Help me out - is there something I’m missing?? AITA?

INFO edit:  he bought me a beautiful, elaborate flower arrangement two years ago for our anniversary, and he has bought me potted  flowers and fruit trees for the yard as gifts. He got pretty mad at me that I don’t spend enough time picking the fruit or tending the flowers, which I get.  I tried to assure him that I really do appreciate the gestures, but I have a tough time keeping up with outdoor gardening on top of full-time work (and, tbh, my other interests, which take me out of the house a lot, since honestly home feels pretty toxic right now) He works part time & is “in charge” (his words) of the outdoor upkeep. We’ve had conversations about getting professional landscaping & an irrigation system, etc., but he has yet to move out on anything. I feel like if I were to ask again he’d feel like I was nagging. He started planning for building a fence 6 months ago & has yet to put 1 screw into 1 board. Oh, and tomorrow is our anniversary, too.",Not the A-hole
AITA for defending my son from my mother.,"Long story cut really short.  I was a bad kid, born in '87 to a single mother.  I was your prototypical ADHD early 90s kid.  It wasn't an easy childhood.  I found my grandmother dead at 3, was abused by a baby sitter at 4.  Fights at school, (this is all pre Columbine, it was a different time then), I never made it easy on her.  But she returned the favor.  So to say it was rough on both of us, is an understatement.  Speed quickly through the years, she agrees with my step dad to kick me out at 16.  So I was homeless till about 19 years old.  I grew up real quick, and saw most of the US as a homeless teenager.  

Speed things up some more, about 7 years ago my step dad died.  She tried to solo everything but ended up having a breakdown.  She lost about 100 pounds and laid in bed so long she caused nerves damage to her legs.  Our relationship was never the strongest, but after the death of my step dad I tried to reach out and be there.  She was always snarky and short, she never made me feel wanted, even at this time.  I was trying to start my own family, married and talking about our first son.  My wife and I talked and we decided she would move in with us.  Shes been with us for 2 years.

She is an absolute dismissive jerk to my son.  Shes been that way to my wife.  My son is NOTHING like I was.  Hes sweet and only wants to put a smile on everyone's face.  So last night, my mom was washing dishes, horribly I might add (I always have to rewash), and left a huge pool of water on the ground in front of the sink.  It's simple here, clean up your won mess.  But she won't, she has an insane amount of excuses to get out of work.  And I get it, neuropathy in the legs has to suck.  So I let most of that shit go.  But my son runs around and slips and falls in the water, I hadn't known it was there yet.  My son comes into the living room and asks ""who spilt water on the floor.""

My mom replies with, ""yea, that why you shouldn't run around.""  Small things like this piss me off.  

I interject and ask ""why do you have to be so short with him"", to which she replies all big eyed, ""that wasn't short"".

Listen, I'm not a normal person.  I'm high anxiety and hold a certain amount of resentment for my mother, but I try not to begrudge her to much, as I was a horrible child.  But I feel like I need to defend my child against her, protect her from the stuff she did to me.  Am I the asshole here?

WIBTA if I kicked out my 'sorta' bf before he can get his kid back?,"Hello reddit first time poster and I know the title makes me sound bad but hopefully the background explains some things. Also I am an English speaking person, I am dyslexic so sorry for any spelling errors, as well as im on mobile so sorry for formatting. 
I never thought I would feel so stuck that I'd need an unbiased opinion from people on the internet but omg! I feel like I'm either in the twilight zone of my own making or an episode of Maury. For the sake of not being able to properly identify what sort of relationship I have right now so ill just refer to myself in first person (32f) and for him will just call him k(29m). 
I met k roughly 5 years ago at a party. I had just gotten separated from my ex of 7 years, to which I have one disabled child(sole custody). K and I clicked right away but at the time I wasn't in a good place and I had found out that k was dealing d and was an alcoholic. K convinced me that he needed me to help him and in the end, before he left for rehab, i was left with $2000 in debt and an abortion that was forced on me (not by him but by friends). Now mind you thats just the backstory and alot happened since then. 
For the last year k been staying with me pretty much rent free, the only thing he pays is our shared phone bill. We've never actually been offical but its come to the point where he wants all the benefits of being my bf but I get nothing in return. Now take in that I kicked him out about 4 months ago because I found out he was being inappropriate with his ""bff"", which is a girl who Was engaged to her still bf. K was out for about 2 months and the only reason I stayed in contact was due to the phone. (2year contract). But now that k's here again, he's been good, he says he just wants to get visitation with his son and then he'll be serious about us. Now for the question. K doesn't really have any other place to go, he does have a car, no job, collecting cerb, he only pays for phone and his own expenses. Please don't judge this but he is Extremely attractive and he knows it. As well as the sex is amazing, I've never bonded sexually like i do with him... very last thing and the largest reason I dont know if I should kick him out i think I might be pregnant but im so praying im not. If you got to the end of this. Would I be the a-hole if I just wait till im ok financially to kick him out regardless of whether he's gotten his kid back? If you got to the end and this doesn't make sense, or there's not enough info im sorry and thank you just for reading 

Edit: thank you to everyone who has taken the time to read this. I've been reading the comments and its so nice to see how I'm not crazy and it does feel like I'm being played... 
For the those who says my excuses for him arnt very good. I have spoken to him about my worries and concerns. I have at times asked him if we were a couple he would say no but when i tried to get him to start packing he changes his tune and when I bring up my issues again he has this way of turning things around. Saying things like ""im not going seeing other girls"", "" your the one who's making this an issue"" but this are when I bring up either his cell or his so called ""bff"". These pale since I feel like if I also kick him out ill never see my money back. Three years ago it was 2000, it has built up too over 4500 as well as he still has to pay rent. I've been hearing about how I need to just wait, if I wait abit longer it will get better. 
Also for those who are concerned about my financial situation, I rent my own home, pay my own bills (this includes my phone as well) I am not financially tied to him and can support another child on my own if it comes to that.
I hope this clears some things. I dont want to seem like the bad guy. I live in a small place and things like this as the single mother get around quickly.

Second edit: although it is really true that I do find him attractive and the sex is great thats not the sole reason im with him. I was madly in love with k for years, its only been since he last came back that my feels have died. He wasn't suppose to stay this long as well as he was suppose to take over 50% of household responsibilities. Those things never happened. I feel like shit knowing that he doesn't have money to support himself, his family can't help him and his ""bff"" won't be able to help him either. He's been trying for months to get visitation back and even though I've been helping him his car seems to be draining quite abit of money as well as child support for his other kid...
Once again probably not very good reasons but I've been told to just kick him out but I've done that and he just comes back. Twisting the knife in my heart till I see 'reason' and give him Some time till he ends up just not leaving. Or when I have had enough I get made to feel like its all my fault..",Not the A-hole
AITA for snapping at my friend when I came out a third time?,"Sorry if the formating is bad, I’m on mobile. 

The first time I (18F) came out to my friend (20M) was last summer. We were talking about our lives and when we got to the topic of crushes, I used “she” pronouns by accident, which he caught on and ask why I said that. I realized my mistake but I thought, hey, we’re good friends so I said “I like girls too”. He didn’t say anything after that, so I got scared he didn’t take it well and left. He called me and asked why I was upset, and I explained why and he apologized. We made up and were on okay terms since then. 

This summer, I changed my Instagram profile to have a rainbow emoji on it, just to show pride in a small way. Not long after He texted me “so what’s the rainbow in your name for?” I was confused and thought he was messing with me, so I said “you know what it’s for”. He texted back “wait, you’re....” and I said yeah, bc i thought he would be able to fill in the blank himself, AND that I already came out to him a year before. 

Nope. Last month he sends me a homophobic meme (it wasn’t malicious or threatening but it was really poor taste) and asked me if this is what the emoji in my bio meant. I asked him to clarify why he was asking and he told me he just was trying to figure what it symbolized. When he asked “does it stand for happiness,” I snapped and texted back “No, it’s because I’m half a homosexual and this is my small way of showing pride without being explicit, is this a good enough info, or do you need more detail??” 

He called me immediately to apologize. He told me he genuinely forgot, but that he does faintly remember me saying I liked girls. I felt awful for snapping at him, because I didn’t know he has bad memory, and I realized it’s possible he’s bad at picking up social cues, and that I maybe wasn’t explicit enough when I came out to him. 

Aita for snapping at my friend? We haven’t talked much since then and I feel awful.",Not the A-hole
AITA for “weaponizing my femininity” by crying since the teacher wouldn’t stop another student harassing me ?,"UPDATE at the bottom 


Edit2: Since many people are sending me DMs, me and my dads went to the principal today. Will post an update when the situation is solved. 

Edit: please remove if not allowed mods. I’m talking to my dads today and will ask them to got he principal with me  , the comments here made a little sacred about how wrong this could go and how bad was the situation. Will post an update if things can be posted online. 

Also I’m not in USA, even if this sound fake to you,  here in South America things are really this bad guys. 

—-
For a little backstory, I (15f) lost my mom when I was 5, dad raised me alone until last year when my second dad, whom I call papa, moved to our home. Now we are a happy family of four (me, two dads and dog). 

I’m not ashamed of my family so I never hid it, I’m not really popular at school so I just really told my friends and it was all good. Until about two months ago a boy I’ll call Duncan (15m) found out. 

Duncan started simple with jokes like “wow which one of them is the mom?” Which I promptly told the teacher, Mr.Smith, who was like “He’s just trying to understand, if you want people to understand you have to be patient”. 

Duncan started to escalate with “Enjoy your time here, it’ll get worse when your sinner family goes to hell” and again I went to Mr.Smith who again was “You can’t be prejudiced with his religion, it’s wrong in the Bible. He’s is just trying to understand.”

In my country every class has only one responsible teacher so I couldn’t go to another btw. 

I have many examples but this paints the picture. After two months of that I realized that if I wanted him to stop I had to do it myself. 

So when he started with his homophobic shit at the cafeteria I started to remember the saddest thing I could, all movies where the dog dies. All the sad romance movies. Mufasas’ Death. The Fox and The Hound. 

It didn’t take long for the waterworks to come. I started to bawl. Ugly sobbing while basically screaming at him asking why he said I would go to hell, why he hated me and my dads. Just making a huge scene.  Duncan started to stutter and plead, trying to make me go to class with him and talk to the teacher (wonder why). I just cried louder and flinched when he tried to pull me away. 

The scene was so huge that we ended up  at the principals office. Ms.Yates listened to both sides and she was pissed at Mr. Smith, she let me tell the whole story even when Mr. Smith tried to interrupt me to defend Duncan. At the end Duncan got a 5 day suspension and the principal told me to go directly to her if ANYTHING like that happens again. 

When we left the office Mr.Smith stoped me and told me “I hope you’re happy. You put a permanent mark on a good boy’s record because you decided to weaponize your femininity instead of being a little understanding.” He tried to make me apologize to Duncan but I told him I would go right back to the principals office if he did and he dropped it. 

Then later Duncan’s friends started messaging me accusing me of acting like amber heard and ruining a boys life just because I can. 

I didn’t tell my parents yet because they are always afraid I’ll suffer because they choose to love each other and I’ll not bring anything I can handle to worry them. 

I don’t feel like I’m wrong, but with Mr.Smith’s warning and Duncan’s friends I’m starting to doubt , so AITA?

FINAL EDIT AND UPDATE


Mods told me to update here so the post is quite long, sorry!

First I’d like to thank you guys for opening my eyes to how bad the situation was and how it could get worse, and how I was hurting my dads by not letting them protect me like I want to protect them. 

Now to the update: Sunday I sat my dads down and told them everything, I was crying a bit  in the end since while telling them I realized how heavy it felt to be carrying all this.

Sunday was the first time I saw the angry side of Adam (will just use names since the nickname I use in my language clash with English), not at me like but at Mr.Smith. He saw red but the first thing was reassure me I was not in trouble and would never be for fighting against bullies. Dad didn’t talk much, he seemed so sad and shocked just holding my hand, but Adam talked more than I ever heard about his past. About bullying from teachers, students , church and even family. 

He told me about how cruel the world can be to who is different, how people will try to silent me and minimize my anger and my suffering and to never back down, that I will always have my family behind me. 
He thanked me for loving them so much that I was willing to fight for them, but told me I was the child here, his child that he never imagined he could have and that he would protect me. 

I didn’t realize how much he loved me. I knew he liked me, he is my family, but I felt just as loved as when dad tells me he loves me. It was a very nice and warm feeling. 

Adam and Dad went to school with me on Monday, straight to Ms.Yates office and told her everything; about the texts (I had them all on my WhatsApp), about Mr.Smith and I explained the bullying in more details. 

Their conversation was long and after I gave all the info I could, I was asked to leave to class while they talked and only knew the result when I came back home. 

My dads gave Ms.Yates two choices: She removes Mr.Smith from teaching and do a seminar with the teachers about bullying and LGBT causes that my dads are willing to pay for. Or they remove me from the school, sue the school and go to the local newspaper with the story. 

She choose the first option but asked for a month to find another teacher. Meanwhile she will monitor my class closely and Mr.Smith won’t be allowed to penalize my grades like some you guys feared. 

Apparently Adam has a bit more experience dealing with this shit than I knew. 

But he also explained to me about privilege and that talking worked so well this time because this is a private school that worries about money and reputation and we have enough money to fight, pay for a lawyer and sue. He told me that many of children from public schools, like his childhood, have to suffer in silence because they don’t have the support we got this time.

So, nothing really extraordinary, it all went like many of you guys predicted: Duncan will keep being my classmate but at least Mr.Smith won’t bully any more of us, he was the real asshole in the situation. 

Also my Papa is awesome and a badass.",Not the A-hole
AITA for getting into it with my pregnant adopted sister about her child,"Ok this woman (f29) was I (m27) guess you could say brought into the family by my mother. They know each other from doing karaoke together. She treats her like a daughter. She's very stand-offish about everything. Especially when someone tries to tell her something. The 'no one tells me what to do' type. She has gotten into fights about it before. One could also say she's very lazy and not the best at being a parent.

She has a 2 yr old from a younger guy and they're broken up. Now she's 3 months pregnant by another guy that she's also no longer with. Recently she was kicked out of the house she was let to live in by the first guys parents. My mother let her and her daughter move in with us without running it by anyone. Just 'they're staying for a while'. Now the issue today. Ever since she's moved in she's done nothing but sleep and sit there. We've been looking after her daughter, plus already taking care of my nephew. Ok I'll say it, her 2 yr old is spoiled like crazy. She screams her head off constantly and is mean to my nephew. Her mother just gives into her so she won't scream. Today after watching her while her mom slept half the day, I suggested that she needs to clean up the toys she has spread across the house. Her mom looked at me dead face and just kept saying 'she's 2'. And?? She played with them and left them out, she should have to clean them up or atleast her mother clean them up if she's not going to. She popped off 'NO ONE TELLS ME OR MY CHILD WHAT TO DO. OR TELLS ME WHAT TO DO ABOUT MY CHILD'

That's all I said was she needs to learn how to clean up after herself. Back to 'she's 2'. Then saying 'you're not a parent. You don't have a say in what someone does with their child'. No im not but I've helped raise enough to know what im talking about I think. She went on a rant of how stressed she is. I told her that was her own fault by the decisions she's made of her own doing. Now we're both red in the face and I'm done messing with her kid. Not my problem, never was in the first place. As I'm writing this the child is still screaming.

And before anyone asks the info is: I'm 27. I'm disabled because of a lot of health problems. I pay my portion of the bills with my once a month check. Yes I still live at home because the Dr says I shouldn't live alone due to my seizures. Plus what the market is right now, I can't afford it. My nephew is 5 from my sister. He's knows how to clean up after himself and yes we helped him learn how.

No she doesn't have a job. She hasn't had one since she got pregnant with her 2 yr old. She says she looking. No car of her own either. She's been here for 2 weeks so far and Idk when she's leaving or if she ever is. Yes I know I sound like a turd getting into it with her while she's pregnant but I'm not the only one in the house whose she's been into it with about her child.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I accepted my grandma’s money?,"I (26f) have had no contact with my grandma for a few years now. She has especially hurt my parents along with me and my siblings. None of us contact her except my parents will send her and grandpa a Christmas card and Easter card every year. It’s a simple card that doesn’t have any personalization. After this past Christmas card, grandma sent back money for each of us and a letter saying it’s not her fault how all our relationships with her ended blah blah blah. My other family members refuse to take their part of the money because they don’t want to give her the satisfaction of her doing something “good.” They asked what I want to do and I’m torn. A part of me wants to refuse the money in order to stand with my family. A part of me also doesn’t care what my grandma feels whether that is disappointment or satisfaction so I don’t really care if she feels “proud of herself” if I accepted the money. I could really use the money to help pay for my upcoming wedding or just use it towards a big donation to charity if I end up being uncomfortable using it for myself. My parents can get upset with these types of things and I really don’t want to upset them but I’ve also have always acted according to their feelings and have looked back with some regret on certain situations. WIBTA if I accepted the money?

Edit: my grandma sent everyone’s share of the money to my parents to give to us so my parents will definitely know if I take it.

People have been asking what my grandma did but it’s hard to sum up. I’ll repeat what I posted in the comments: She’s done a lot of things. It’s really not just one thing. One thing she has done is that she looked down on my mother and my mother’s family when my dad and her got married because they came from the “poor” part of her home country while the grandma we are speaking of came from the upper class area of that country. I think she is just a horrible person in general but yeah, she could be a bigot too.

People have also been asking how much money it is which I honestly assumed was irrelevant. The thing is I’m not entirely sure but my mom thinks it’s $500 (each of us received a check made out to us in an envelope and she tried to see through the envelope without opening it). I consider that to be a lot of money.",Not the A-hole
AITA for telling my older sister she needs to tell her therapist about her sleeping problems?,"Background info about my sister and I: we both have depression and anxiety but her depression is worse and and anxiety is worse. 
We go the gym after work but here lately we haven’t because either i’m in a bad mood/tired or she is. My sister is always saying “I wake up hours before I have to go in and I can’t fall back asleep”, “I finally fell asleep at x time because I just couldn’t fall asleep”. So yesterday before our shift I texted and asked her if we were going to go to the gym after and she said “I probably won’t be going at all because I don’t get enough sleep when I do”. Right after I texted and basically said “I think you should tell your therapist about your sleeping problems” mainly because I literally went through the same thing years before and it was solved as soon as I mentioned the problem. After I told her that she replied “I am not the mood rn” which means that pissed her off. The only reason I want her to go with me is because I feel like a lost puppy when I go there by myself due to my anxiety so she most likely thought I was hitting back at her because I was annoyed. I really wasn’t. I have lots of concerns for my sister. I find myself the worse when I don’t hear from her in a day or two (we live on the same property just different houses). Anyways, I explained that I wasn’t trying to be mean or a smartass or anything like that and I truly meant no harm. Me saying that caused her to leave work only 30 mins after clocking in and I feel like it was my fault. Also, she’s most likely gonna get fired and I feel like that’s my fault as well.
So am I the asshole for telling her she needs help AND make her leave work?",Not the A-hole
AITA for making my partners drinking water too warm?,"*edit* more INFO added to bottom

To set the scene, I(35M) like to drink cold or chilled water and my partner (33F) likes room temperature preboiled water. 

To accommodate for both our needs, we have a kettle for boiling water, after which it is transferred to 2 water jugs, which are either left at room temperature or used to refill the dispenser in the fridge.

Onto the situation, 3 months ago I emptied both room temperature jugs into the fridge and boiled more water at night before bed. Partner came down, was furious she had no room temperature water to drink and we came to an agreement - dont fill up both jugs into the dispenser and leave her one.

Fast forward to Today, there was going to be some burst water main repairs outside by the utility company so in the morning before my partner woke up, I decided to make sure we had enough water to drink. I filled the dispenser with 1 jug, then halved the room temperature water in the other jug into both 

(we had previously shattered a jug on a cold day when we poured boiling water in, so I thought I'd temper this by making sure the boiling water would enter lukewarm water reducing chances of shattering the jugs)

I went back to work and thought nothing of it. Partner wakes up and goes down and she is furious. She doesnt have any room temperature water. I try to placate her by mixing the lukewarm water with water from the dispenser to make ""room temperature"" water but its futile.

She wont relent. She tips the entire bottle of water I mixed out into the sink and tries herself and cant get the temperature right either. She is absolutely raging at me at this point for not listening to her or caring about her needs. She storms out of the house in a huff. 

So AITA here or is perhaps this being blown out of proportion and mixing water to a specific temperature is not as big of a deal?

Edit: Okay wow, this really blew up. Who knew water would be so polarising... never thought this post would start Lukewarm Watergate.  

Just got off work and reading through all the replies. Looks like theres lots of questions so I'll do my best to answer them and provide some clarity.

Thank you everyone for the comments, the stories, the judgements, and everything in between. Appreciate all the input so far and theres been some great takes that I'll take to heart and consider properly. Including how best to communicate post watergate with my partner.

So more INFO:

Who boiled the kettle and filled the jugs the previous night? I did

Why did you touch all the water? Firstly we dont have one jug for her and one for me, we have 2 jugs for the household (me and her). I forgot about the water mains being repaired until early this morning when the trucks showed up and they started working. I rushed down and made sure there was enough water for both of us. Not just me. On top of filling all the jugs and the dispenser and boiling another kettle full of water, I also filled a few sinks so we'd have extra water to flush the toilet if need be. I honestly thought the water would cool enough by the time she woke up since it's a cold day, but I guess I was wrong? I didn't expect her to react the way she did. 

Is she OCD? No, shes just pedantic about certain things and needs them to be a specific way. But I dont think it's any more demanding than any other person who is neat and tidy and has certain idiosyncrasies. 

Why don't you drink from the tap?/Are you Asian? Yes, we are an Asian couple. Many of you have guessed that. Drinking boiled water is cultural, and a preference. There is nothing particularly wrong with the tap water in our country (Australia), but it ""tastes"" better to my partner after being boiled. Warm, but not boiling water tastes different than cooled to room temperature boiled water to her. 

So it's a preference. I preferred chilled water but I'd happily drink room temperature water or even warm if there wasnt any chilled water. I drink what we have, but preferred to have chilled. It doesnt affect me in any big way. This morning I just filled everything I could, including the dispenser.

Why dont you use ice? I can definitely use ice but our fridge has a built in dispenser (that we have to manually fill) so I do that from time to time with water from the jugs. Normally I will only ever use one, and leave one for her. This morning in my haste I used both as I wanted to make sure everything was full - dispenser, both jugs, and kettle.

Why dont you have more jugs? Trust me this is definitely our next step. As well as the brita water filter, but worried she might not like the taste... plus she might insist we boil it first before it goes into the brita. 

Why did you pour half the water into an empty jug and fill both with boiling? As previously explained, we shattered a glass jug on a cold day previously pouring boiling water directly into it, because... science I don't know the physics here. Anyways I was trying to avoid that and thought the boiling + room temperature water would cool sufficiently by the time she woke up. I calculated wrong. 

Anyways hope that clarifies most of the questions. Will post an update once we've reached an amicable resolution. My guess is that it's not about the water as some people have already said but theres other underlying issues and this was a trigger.

AITA for suggesting to my peer that her visa may be delayed because she’s Iranian?,"So for context, I’m on a student visa in the UK and just finished my masters. Now that we’ve finished our program, those who want to stay in the UK must apply for a graduate visa. I personally haven’t applied yet because I’m waiting until after Christmas, but a girl in my program applied back in early October and still hasn’t received a decision.

Grad visas are typically quick, depending on the country you’re from/your nationality. My roommate is Canadian and got hers in 2 weeks. So understandably, the girl in my program is worried that something is wrong with her visa application and took to our program’s WhatsApp group to ask for advice/opinions.

The girl is Iranian/American. Like, her parents are Iranian but she was born in the US. I told her that it is a bit strange that it’s taken this long, considering most people receive them in a few weeks. I suggested that maybe her application is flagged due to her Iranian nationality, as immigration takes those things into consideration.

She and everyone else in the group chat ganged up on me and said I was an “ignorant American” for suggesting that just because she’s Iranian doesn’t mean they would deny her visa. The girl said she “renounces her Iranian heritage” and has no connections, and it has nothing to do with it. I just shut up and apologized, saying I was just trying to think of any possible reason. A lot of people replied to me saying how dare I suggest Iranians be denied simply because of their country.

Anyways, I feel like a bit of a dick for suggesting she may be denied or at least flagged due to her nationality, is that an asshole move?

TLDR: girl in my program is Iranian/American and hasn’t gotten her visa yet. I suggested it may be because she’s Iranian, and essentially was called racist.",Not the A-hole
WIBTA if I didn't allow a PTSD service dog at my wedding?,"Throwaway account.

I'm 19 and nonbinary, my partner is 20 and nonbinary. My aunt is 40ishF. Same with my mother.

Backstory:
My aunt has a PTSD service dog. I have no idea how it passed the service dog test because every time I am out with her it causes chaos. Destroying store displays, getting into altercations with other dogs, barking, etc.

My mother is SEVERELY allergic to the dog - every time she's around the dog, her throat starts closing up. She also gets severe allergy symptoms (itchy eyes, runny nose, hives, etc). She CANNOT be around this dog. My aunt refuses to acknowledge this, and continuously stands in close proximity to my mother with her service dog.

So, I'm starting to figure out the guest list for my wedding. I'd love for my aunt to be there (potentially even in my wedding party!), but I have never seen her attend an event with her dog without there being absolute chaos. The dog is loud, messy, and constantly getting into things. My aunt does NOT keep the dog under control, especially at family events (which is what she'd consider my wedding). She also refuses to keep the dog away from my mother, despite being told that if my mom has too much contact with the dog she could literally go into anaphylaxis and DIE. 

As well, it's small, but my partner is also allergic to the dog - not to the extent that my mother is, but still enough that even with allergy meds they still feel icky.

My partner and I are in agreement that the service dog cannot come to our wedding. We're willing to make as many accommodations as possible to make my aunt comfortable at the wedding (setting aside a quiet space for her, reserving a seat for her, etc) but she has shown time and time again that she cannot control her dog and be considerate of my mother's health issues. And when it comes down to it, if I have to choose between having my mother at my wedding and having my aunt at my wedding, I'm going to choose my mother.

WIBTA if I don't let her bring her service dog?


Edit: some important info I forgot to include (oops!). I'm not in the US. Where I am (BC, Canada) we have a way to get government certified service animals - they have to either be trained by a professional trainer, or undergo a public safety test. My aunt's dog did the latter, so it is a government certified service animal, not an ESA. She just chooses not to enforce the training.",Not the A-hole
AITA for saving pictures of a stranger i have a crush on?,"throwaway so she doesn't find this, and on mobile so apologies in advance.

so I'm 29, AFAB nonbinary. she's a popular-ish webcomic artist who recently came out as a trans woman (38 years old, I think?). she's also very much my internet-personality crush: I know nothing will come of it, she just seems so cool and I find her attractive. she posts selfies every week to sorta track her HRT effects.

here's where I'm afraid I might be TA: I save her selfies to my phone when she posts them. I don't do anything weird like jerk off to them or anything, but she's so beautiful and I love how happy she always looks in them. plus, having followed her since before she transitioned, I'm amazed and proud of how far she's come.

I do have a boyfriend and he knows about this weird crush i have. he does not care.

tl;dr AITA for saving selfies posted by a person i don't know because I think she's pretty?

EDIT: it says ""not enough info"" so I'll clarify that the pictures are posted publicly on her Facebook and Twitter pages both, where she has over 6k followers. I have never contacted her beyond standard replies on twitter (""wow you're so pretty!""). she's happily married and I have no intention of taking this any further than saving her pictures to my phone to look at because her smile makes me feel good.",Not enough info
AITA for expecting my bio dad to bring my siblings since we live in different states?,"For clarification, I have extreme anxiety when it comes to driving in areas I don't know, even in heavy traffic and in a passengers seat I'll start to cry and get scared. And I have told him as such.

So my biological dad (John) gave me up to my grandparents, who are now my parents, as a baby. When I was 15 is when I first met him and my siblings that he had with his new wife. I love my siblings with all my heart even though I've only gotten to see them a few times.

Two, almost three, years ago was the last time I got to see them because he refused to come back to my parents house. John and my parents have never gotten along and he blames them for everything wrong in his life before he left the state. 

John and I have different political views, which is where this conflict starts. I genuinely don't care how our views effect our relationship, he has never made an effort to actually be in my life unless I explicitly begged him to. I don't think what politics we believe in should effect how he lets me have a relationship with my siblings, which is the only thing I want. 

Recently we got into another political debate (that I won't go into) and I said that I was done with the conversation and that I'll text him when I'll have my new house ready so he can bring my siblings and let me see them. Which hopefully will be in the next couple weeks. All I got was a laughing emoji response.

So was I ta? I don't think I was but if I am I'll accept it. hopefully I left enough info for everyone",Not enough info
AITA for eloping and sending elder fam mailed announcements?,"I sent valentines to 2 Great Aunts (GA1,GA2) that I last saw 6 yrs ago. USPS returned GA1’s. I texted GA2 to see if info changed and sent a FB message bc my last several texts went unreplied.

GA2: “She & I thought you just disappeared!”

Me: “I’m not sure why you’d have that impression. My phone number hasn’t changed since ‘04.”

GA2: “I did get your wedding info and was SHOCKED to not be invited to the wedding RIGHT HERE. Was it totally private?” She also said her number changed, and GA1 relocated, ending with “I’m glad you found me!” We’ve been connected on FB for years.

(I eloped in ‘21, 4 hrs from nearest fam. Before making it FBO, we sent announcements: “{He} and {I} were happily married in a private ceremony on X at X. You were deeply missed but we saved you a front row seat. View the romantic ceremony at 🔗.” The back said their presence in our lives was the only gift we could ask for).

Me: “We didn’t invite anyone. It was just the two of us.”

GA2: “That’s what we assumed. I recall you had been there many times before too.”

Me: “It was our first time there, and if you looked through our photos or video, it was clear that it was just the two of us.”

GA2: “Well… I think we were both just shocked at no mention of a wedding… & the notices were surprising and a bit impersonal. Ya know some family can just be in your face and rude too. We did not want that to happen, so you can see the confusion when no contact is in the mix???”

Me: “That’s what eloping is. Two people do their own thing. Each announcement cost me money to send, I apologize if it was ‘impersonal.’ Others loved it, thought it was beautiful, and were happy we did what was best for us.”

“Ma is a troubled person who hates Dad’s side of the family. The last time she was around Uncle, he called the cops (to kick her out of the ICU while my gpa died). Her side won’t see her, leaving us w/ no option to host my fam.

“Also, everyone in my husband’s family is a caretaker, with responsibilities in (state). It felt wrong to do something with his family and not mine. We also got married during a pandemic and would never ask people to travel due to various comfort levels.

“We did what was best for us. Weddings typically go far beyond people’s means, and we limited how much money we spent and paid everything ourselves. We also limited the time, travel, and money we would’ve asked others to spend on us. Finally, we stand behind our choice.”

She was typing, but she’d said enough. I blocked.

A wedding wasn’t in the cards. Grandparents are dead. Big bro & dad died years ago of substance abuse. The living hate each other. If I went to a holiday dinner with my Dad’s family as a kid, with nothing planned at home, my mom threatened to put my stuff on the lawn and tell me not to come home.

I looked at texts to GA2. She last responded on her b-day after we eloped w/ thanks but never congrats.

AITA for wanting to stay true to my wife’s wishes?,"I (28f) lost my wife Em two years ago in an accident when our son was less than a year old. Throughout our entire relationship (from ages 20-26) she was very open about how her parents did not accept her, and that she’d given up on offering an olive branch. She seemed to have made peace with the fact that they weren’t around anymore, and my family always embraced her with open arms so she still had some support regardless.

When we had our son, Em told me she didn’t want her parents to know anything about our child, even through the grapevine. She had let her mom and dad know that we were getting married a few years prior, but they didn’t respond very well to the news so she didn’t think they would change their tune.
If they did ever manage to hear about our son’s birth, they never contacted us to say anything about it.

They didn’t come to the funeral. I invited them because I thought that maybe they’d want to be there. She was their only child and I assumed that any animosity they had about how she lived would have been overshadowed by the loss of her in general.
I heard nothing from them for two years until a few weeks ago when I got a message request on FB from Em’s mother. 
She said she and her husband wanted to know more about me and our son, so she invited me to get a cup of coffee since they were in town.

I agreed to meet them to talk, but I left my son at home with my sister. They looked a little disappointed when I got there and he wasn’t with me, but they didn’t say anything about that at first.
They started off with a few normal questions, how we met, what Em's life was like, what our wedding was like. Then they started asking about when they could spend time with our son because they had a right to as his grandparents.
I told them that my wife had made it very clear that she didn’t want them to know anything about our baby. I felt like I was already betraying Em’s wishes by agreeing to meet with them and even showing them pictures of him, so the idea of them meeting him on top of all that was a little too much for me at the time. I said I needed to take a bit to think about whether or not I'd allow that.

They both seemed upset about it, and they started to argue with me so I shut the conversation down and said I’d contact them again when I made my decision.
I went home and told my sister what happened, and she said that she understood I wanted to listen to Em’s wishes, but she’s gone now, and it’s totally possible that her parents have changed. She felt it would be wrong of me to stop them from having a relationship with their daughter’s only child. She also said I was just making it harder on myself by avoiding people who could help me raise my son since now I’m doing it on my own.

I just don’t want to betray Em.

INFO:
- I was the one who gave birth to our son. He’s biologically mine.
- Em was emancipated at 17, but she did continue to try and speak with them on and off for a few years up until our wedding.
- I know that if they had changed, Em would’ve forgiven them because that’s just the kind of person she was. I agreed to meet them because I wanted to know if they regretted how they treated her

Edit no.2:
I’m sorry if I wasn’t clear enough in the OP, but Em was gay. She and I are both women. Her parents rejected her because of her sexuality.",Not the A-hole
AITA for lashing out at my friends during a deep conversation?,"Me and three other friends decided to study for our finals at our uni's library. Hours later and we went to go out for dinner together. 

One of my three friends, Amy, barely opens up about her life. But she had trusted me enough to tell snippets of her problems. While the four of us talked over dinner, Amy suddenly opens up about her difficult life. It was a rare occurence and we were all ears, except for Bertha. She kept cutting in while Amy was talking to talk about HER own difficulties in life. 

( For info; among the four of us, only me who has their parents still together. this will be important later. )

The three of us were comforting Amy, basically just showering her with sympathy. But, for some reason, while Bertha is talking, she would suddenly say things like, "" (my name) life is easier cause her parents are still together. "" The others laughed while I told her that is unnecessary.

What really made me mad was when I was just listening to them talking about their lives, Bertha took another jab at me by saying, "" well, (my name) wouldn't understand what any of us is talking because her life is easier.""

I immediately told her that doesn't mean I'm not telling about my family problems to them, it automatically means I had an easier life.

My friends didn't take it well as they were pissed at me for being entitled. That I should acknowledge how my life is better than theirs. In their defence, I said it in a harsh voice and rolled my eyes afterwards which is childish. However, I feel like things would have gone better if they just stopped alienating me from the convo.

AITA for posting about a guy who used to bully me?,"I was bullied for four years from middleschool to eleventh grade. I’m a rising senior. This guy, let’s call him Dave, bullied me in multiple ways.

In ninth grade, he got caught. I was excited Becuase I thought it would stop. However, instead I got blamed for it. 

I believe victim blaming is a big problem, so I posted about it. I talked about how he called me an idiot and how he made me feel stupid. I posted on Snapchat because I didn’t expect anyone to check my story or anyone to care. If I wanted to reach a wide audience, I would have used a different platform.

People were swiping up and I was honestly surprised. They were saying they supported me. However, a guy I know told me that he had my back because he was in a group chat with the guy. Apparently him and some of my friends were talking about how I was just seeking pity. Dave said if I had just confronted him, he would’ve apologized. I have before, he never has Becuase he doesn’t get it, he doesn’t understand. 

I posted an apology and deleted the original, but now people are telling me that I shouldn’t apologize. 

I think I’m the asshole Becuase people are telling me I was just posting for pity. That I was an attention seeker. They’re saying that I shouldn’t have posted it on my main. I feel bad because I didn’t think that people would even read it. I also posted his name, but I did that because I would tell my closest friends about what happened and would leave out his name for the sale of anonymity.

AITA for considering not going to family Christmas because my parents invited my Cousin to a party?,"I'm seriously considering skipping Christmas with my family this year and I'm worried I'm the asshole.

Last weekend my parents had a Christmas Party with my extended family. I was invited, but I was unable to attend. After I found out my cousin was invited and attended. I hate this cousin, I refuse to be around him or attend anything he is invited to. I feel I'm justified in hating him, but it's not a topic that can be discussed in this subreddit. I have made it clear to my parents that if they invite him not to invite me. They have ignored this boundary multiple times and invited both him and me to events. I finally told my parents why I hate this cousin and they seemed to understand why I refuse to be around him, but now they're inviting us both again. 

This weekend is our close family Christmas and I'm considering not going because of this. They have ignored my boundaries again and I feel like unless I put my foot down on this boundary they will continue to ignore it. But I worry Christmas time might not be a good time to do so.

AITA for snapping at classmate when she woke me up to study for our exam?,"We had two consecutive exams these two days for which, my classmate 'Maddie' has asked me to give her an overview about. Meaning to tell her what information she needs to know in a concise way so she can then target her studying more effectively. And well we stuck together in the library while preparing for both exam and kept sharing info...etc.

We still have an exam on saturday and Maddie asked me again if I could give her an overview of the subject. I told her that I myself still haven't prepared well for this exam and in order to give an overview, I have to be an expert on the subject and really know what I'm doing. 

So she said no problem let's just study together like we did before. Half an hour through our studying session, my head started hurting really bad (probably from overusing it lol) and I couldn't concentrate anymore. I jokingly told her my brain has glitched and I'll go get some sleep and said sorry about how I won't be able to study with her.

She tried to keep me and persuade me not to do it because there isn't much time left and she can give me some tylenol for my headache. I insisted about going to sleep and she turned her head back to her laptop without replying.

I went back to the dorm, drank some tea and went to sleep. At about 5pm, Maddie wakes me up and tells me that I've slept enough already and should get up to prepare for the exam now. I've been having a hard time sleeping lately due to stress and I was so annoyed about how she interrupted such a deep sleep.

So I snapped at her about how she should mind her own business and that I hate people who nag me to study the most and that she's not my mom and I left my mom and got here in fact so no one nags me.

She was shocked and said what is wrong with me and that she was just looking out for me. She said if she didn't care about me why would she bother to wake me up and that now I get to sleep all I want because she won't care anymore and left.

Okay I'm not saying how I snapped was the right thing to do but I honestly regret not having locked the door. My roommates think I'm the AH for how I snapped when she was just being kind. My bestie thinks I'm not at all but she never liked Maddie so could be biased.

AITA for not adopting a special needs cat?,"My daughter (10f) has wanted to adopt a cat for quite some time now. My husband (40m) and I (37f) discussed it and agreed that she’s now old enough to be able to take on some of the responsibilities that come with owning a cat such as cleaning the litter box. Our son (4m) is also happy about having a pet but tbh I don't think he can understand the responsibility we are taking on. Our daughter was positively ecstatic when we told her we would be adopting a cat. We sat her down and looked through some kid-friendly resources about the adoption process, proper cat care, etc. I suggested to her that she should do some of her own research on what owning a cat requires. 

She must have found some online info about the plight of cats with disabilities and how much less likely they are to be adopted because the next day, she started telling me that we needed to adopt a cat with special needs because otherwise no one would. This took my husband and I by surprise but after some discussion, we agreed to not immediately refuse and to look at what special needs cats were available for adoption. 

When we went to the websites of some local shelters to look at what cats they have up for adoption at the moment, she immediately zero’d in on a bonded pair of cats (9f, 9f) and one of them has a chronic kidney disease. My husband and I attempted to explain that according to the bio on the adoption website, she needs experienced owners who can provide a quiet no-stress (aka no kids) environment thus our family is not well-suited for them. However, the main reason for our refusal which we did not tell our daughter is that the costs that come with treatment and medication are considerable and would put a strain on our finances especially with two cats instead of the agreed-upon one.

Our daughter reacted very negatively to our refusal, has been sulking for days, and involved my parents (her grandparents) when they came to visit. They think we should just let her adopt the cats because we could afford it if we adjusted our budgeting and cut down on some expenses. We would rather not do that because that would mean not doing a family vacation next year and putting off some home renovations.

AITA for refusing to apologise to my husband for a baggage size fine?,"My (30f) husband (33m - P) and I were travelling with our toddler to visit his parents for Christmas. The journey involved a short flight on an airline with strict luggage size restrictions. I always do the packing for myself and our toddler the night before, and P waits until the last minute to throw his stuff in the bag I have provided for him. 
Normally, we travel light with only 3 hand luggage. We use duffel bags, because P thinks they are easier to shove into the luggage size measuring thing at the gate, if required.

On this particular trip, I was worried about us carrying 3 duffel bags and a toddler through the airport because I am pregnant, and have been suffering from bad morning sickness. So I asked P if he would consider booking a hold luggage instead. He said no way, it was too expensive. 
Then the night before the trip, the cat threw up on one of the duffel bags, and so I wasn’t able to use it. I used a small hard shell wheel suitcase instead. It had previously been considered the correct size until about 2 years ago when they made the size restrictions more strict. I knew it was too big, but I didn’t have any other options, and I figured it was unlikely we’d get caught since they haven’t checked our luggage sizes in years and we travel this route often. 

The night before we leave P sees it and says it’s too big. I’m tired and about to go to bed, so I say “it’s fine, they won’t check”. Well we get to the gate, and of course this time they pull us aside and the bag doesn’t fit and they fine me £40 for it to be put in the hold. I pay it. 
P is LIVID and says it is my fault, I am to blame, that I am spoiled for wasting £40, that I don’t understand the value of money. And that I need to apologise to him. I refuse. He then freezes me out and does not look at me or speak to me for about 5 hours. This lasts the length of the flight, the car ride to his parents house, and the first few hours at his parents house. He says I need to apologise. 
I don’t think I should apologise because 1. I didn’t have any other bag options 2. I paid the fine 3. £40 is not the end of the world. Yes it sucks, and I wish we didn’t have to pay it, but we are lucky enough to be able to pay it and not be struggling. 
His response was that since he earns the money, me paying the fine isn’t really me paying it, since he gave me that money in the first place.

Info- he works full time in a well paying medical profession. We are not wealthy but are comfortable. I did not go back to work after having our toddler. He grew up in a rural town, middle class home, rarely travelled, two working parents. He is very frugal.
I grew up as an expat, one working parent. My family is not rich, the expat lifestyle is deceptive.

AITA for having my younger sister pay for my makeup that she ruined?,"Before I start the story I just want to say that my mom has told me she will be using the gift card my sister got for Christmas (it has $500) to buy me new makeup. 

So I 16(f) started makeup about a year ago with a simple eyeshadow look for homecoming which resulted in me getting makeup for last Christmas which brings me to why I’m writing this today. My sister 11(f) likes going into my room and grabbing and playing with things she is not supposed to since I’m at school more than I’m at home due to my extracurriculars. I tell my parents what she does and they just tell her to stop going into my room which of course doesn’t stop her. She’s grabbed a lot of things including my makeup. She will grab my pallets and destroy them and my dad always ends up paying me back for what she destroys. 

A few days ago my sister asked if I could do my makeup in her room with her and I agreed since I don’t really spend time with her because we have different interests. I mistakenly left my makeup in her room without putting anything away and the next day (yesterday) I went to collect it all without checking if she had messed anything up. I didn’t realize she had messed anything up until I was packing for a roadtrip and my gut told me to look at my brushes and my makeup. That’s when I realized my beauty blender was covered in concealer and foundation. When I opened my concealer it was empty and my foundation was basically gone. 

It was late at night and my sister was sleeping so I let it be until the next day which is when im writing this. I told my mom what happened and my sister still lied in both our faces. My mom resolved the issue by telling me to send her a list on Amazon of the things she ruined/used and she will use her gift card to buy it for me but the thing is the bare minerals blush is a name brand item and it’s one of the more expensive makeup products I own. When I looked up the price since the blush was a gift from my godmother for my confirmation i started feeling bad because I didn’t want to charge my sister $20 for a blush so I added some cheaper options for my mom to get. 

I’m still mad at her now because I bought most of the makeup I own with my money that I earned (with about two pallets and the blush being a gift from family) I feel like it isn’t enough. My sister is the youngest so my parents do go a little bit easier on her but I feel she needs more than a slap on the wrist and a lecture. This problem has gotten so bad that I have considered changing the locks on my room (the lock is broken so it doesn’t work) just so she can stop getting my belongings. I feel like TA because most times I’m told I am because I put it somewhere where she can easily grab it or because she’s only 11 and I’m 16. So, AITA?

Update/ info left out: I have read the replies and I will look into lockboxes for my makeup For some asking, my sister does not get allowance. The way she is reimbursing me for it is a gift card my parents gave her for Christmas with more than enough funds to pay me back. I do take responsibility for leaving my makeup with my sister and I do plan on getting her her own makeup since she’s interested in it. I have been working on getting my lock fixed or at least replacing it with a functioning lock and just leaving it locked until I come home. This AITA post isn’t about how my parents are discipling her I can’t control that. It’s more having her pay full price for makeup she messed up and ruined.

AITA for asking my parents to give me a detailed account of their expenditure and asking them to not spend the money I give them on alcohol,"My parents have never been financially wise, and recently lost a large sum of their pension due to bad investments. Additionally, they have some issues with the over consumption of alcohol, which has been a problem for quite some time. 

I am a full time student, working on a part-time basis. I work and study in Europe and they live in South-Africa. Due to their financial predicament I have been working additional hours to support them financial. However, it has placed tremendous strain on my studies, thus, I have asked them for a detailed account of their expenditure so I can see what more is needed and where we can possibly save. Moreover, I have asked them to not spend the money I give them on alcohol and my dad continues to spend money on home upgrades, that aren't needed, so I asked them to slow down and hold off on that too. 

My mom burst out in tears telling me I'm making her feel inadequate and like a loser and treating them like children. She has this expectation that I should help without questioning how the money is being spent. I want to give with open hands and closed eye, but I too have to budget. It has been putting tremendous strain on my studies, and she makes me feel that each time I ask  questions that I'm making her feel like she is incapable.

AITA for calling my now ex-friend a clown,"

Background info: I met this (ex) friend at another friends birthday, everything was going well and we had a lot in interests. Flash forward a month later she and the mutual friend I met her through brought three more people. So I brought one of my best friends to join the group as well. Making a total of 7 people including me. We all had gotten comfortable enough around each other, so we’d all joking poke at each other, calling each other idiots or dumbasses, etc. However I did not call others idiots or dumbass, I rarely ever did that with my bestfriend who is also in the group.

A break down of the the story is that I had called Jennifer a clown, this had led to her getting Annie one of my friends to turn against me. Mind you I apologized to Jennifer few minutes after me calling her a clown due to me feeling guilty. Jennifer lied to me saying that I had made the others uncomfortable which I hadn’t according to them, this lead to confrontation of Jennifer lying leading to her victimizing herself. Lily who is Jennifer’s friend talked terribly about me calling me the asshole saying how I severely offended Jennifer by calling her clown. Jennifer has a knack for crying whenever she gets confronted always making it seem as if she is the victim despite the fact she manipulated the others to think I was a terribly person, and then acting as if she’s a good friend then proceeding to convince me into leaving the group.

Jennifer has been in a friend group before this one which she had called toxic, she vented to me about it (which I never asked for). Now that I look back to it I believe it was just her who was the problem, since she has issue skipping from friend to friend. 

Was me calling Jennifer a clown, and then her leading to do all of this my fault? So AITA for calling my friend a clown?",Not enough info
AITA for waking out of the restaurant after my boyfriend and family made fun of me ?,"
The title just about sums it up. 

I (23 m) have always and I mean always been the kid that loved going to the dentist. I loved getting my teeth checked and absolutely loved it when they told me my teeth were clean. 

Now I have been with my bf (23m) for about a year. My family loves him and have welcomed him. 

The issue is that 3 weeks ago I went to the dentist for a checkup. They told my wisdom tooth has e hole in it and they told me to come back. Ngl I was super sad, I make it a rule to always have my teeth super cleaned so I this was kinda a bummer. My boyfriend told me to relax, my family to and made some comments about how I’m not gonna survive, and the world is going under. Didn’t say anything but yeah they made fun of me. 

Today I went and to my surprise they told me after looking at it that it was growing out of place and that it was hard to brush it and fix it.  They decided to remove. It went fine and my family thought it would be good to go out to a restaurant where they have some soup for me to have. 

They made fun of me the entire time. In the beginning it was fun but at the end I couldn’t take it no more and was on the verge of tears. I texted my friend and he came to pick me up and I left them without touching my food.

AITA for not wanting to sit with my younger sisters?,"Hi, first post in this sub and I could really use some advice on how to resolve this issue.

My grandmother, had planned to take my family and the family of my best friend to a ballet. In total, there would be 9 of us attending. This would be my grandmother, sisters(4 and 5), my mother, and I(17).
The other family is my friend, her mother, and sister(11).

We only found out about the ballet this weekend. And it's the 16th. Because of this it's hard to get so many seats together.

I suggested that we split up, because there was a group of seats larger enough for almost all but two of us. 
My mother said that my friend, her sister and I could go as a group of 3. 
I'd prefer that it would just be my friend and I, as I don't want to be responsible for a child. Nor do I want to listen to her talking.

But my mother then said that it wouldn't work, that my sisters would have a ""sh*t fit"" over it.

I got frustrated and told her that ""I don't want to sit next to the kids because they'd whine the whole time and ruin it for me""
She got mad about this, like really mad. 

She then said that my grandmother will have to book the tickets instead, and that she and my sisters won't go.

My grandmother is angry because of this and has said that we won't go now.

"AITA for being ""ungrateful"" and refusing to move","So a little context, about 5 years ago me (being 10 at the time) and my family moved to our current town. Which it was very hard to adjust, I was shy for 2 and a half years before I actually started opening up more, which gave me a ton of friends and even a girlfriend. I moved at the beginning of sixth grade and am in eleventh now. Anyway with that in mind let's move on:




So currently I live in the middle of California, Modesto specifically. My parents have been wanting to move up north to near where my uncle and some of my cousins live in the mountains which is near the border of Oregon, 200 miles away. So I was fine with this because from what it sounded like they were gonna do this after I move out and was already an adult. I mean sure it would suck that they lived so far but if they were happy up there I wasn't gonna stop them.



So the other day they pull me into their room to talk. I asked them what's up and they tell me the news that they found a good deal on a house up there and we are planning on moving up there sometime next year. I immediately freak out and tell them that I don't wanna move but they say it would be nice to start a new life. This is what went down


""It would be nice to start a new life ya know? New friends, new house, all of that""



""Yeah, well we did start a new life, 5 years ago. And I'm enjoying that life and don't want to give it up""


""Too late now, the house is already bought, besides you could just make new friends like you did here""


""It took me 3 years to become more social and get used to this, in 3 years I'll already be graduated!""


Well there could've been more stuff there, it was a few days ago after all, and then yeah the argument goes on for a bit then I storm out before yelling that that's bullshit. Also the place I moved from before was only 30 miles away and that was hard, this place is over 200 miles away.


My dad says that a new life up there could be great and I'm being ungrateful since I haven't even seen the house yet. I yell at him that he didn't even ask me first what I thought and he told me that I thought I'd like it since I like visiting my family up there, I like it but it's not a place I'd like to live, I'm more into regular town living, not a mountain town with like only 1000 people. He argues that as long as I live with them I should listen to where they want to live and I just argue back

""I don't have a choice, I am legally obligated to be with you. So don't act like I'm staying here by choice""



So yeah there has been a ton of arguing and my parents keep saying I'm ungrateful since they bought a new house and I hate it when I never even seen the place. So am I really being ungrateful? Since you know, I've just started living my best life after getting used to it here, with a ton of friends, a good youth group, a girlfriend.

AITA for wanting a gift from my husband for chrstmas then being upset about getting nothing,"I (27F) & my husband (29M) have been together for 5 years and had always been on the same wavelength about everything until recently. He got a promotion just before Thanksgiving & he has been physically at home but not say anything or respond with short sentences. I brought this up several times & took on more of the housework & all of the holiday stuff on my shoulders, thinking it was just stress. I get his family (8 people), my family (3), plus groceries/baking/wrapping all done 3 days before the 25th. He didn't say anything about how well things were going or how things were clean & ready. His & our cat's stockinged stuffed with goodies & 3 gifts for him under the tree while my stocking remained  empty & nothing under the tree for me. Then, the day after New Years at dinner after having a wonderful meal, he said I forgot to make him cheesecake. He never wrote it down or mentioned it to me when I wasn't sleep deprived & this broke me. I just shut down, had my fancy milkshake, and broke down in the car. 
So, reddit, AITA? 1-5 rating scale, 5 being worst person alive.

Update: Thank you all for your advice and different perspectives. We were able to talk about what had happened & he actively listened since he started crying and apologizing for how cold and indifferent he had been acting towards me along with the inequity of duties that had piled up. He agreed to research therapists & potentially step down from his current position to his previous one. When I got home from work, there was my favorite takeout in the fridge & a sticky note with a little flower drawing. We both recognize that we have our problems, and luckily, neither of us is too stubborn to admit when we've messed up.",Not the A-hole
AITA for moving out during the holidays without telling my roommate?,"I found my roommate online, and when we met the few times before moving in, she seemed totally normal. After I moved in though, things went downhill fast. I swear it was like she embodied every trope of the shitty roommate and just ratcheted it up to the next level.

She'd leave dirty plates on the counter until flies and mold grew on them. I've walked in on her being intimate with different partner five or six times in a month in our shared living room. She's taken my car without telling me to ""run errands"" before, leaving me stranded at home. She once stole prescription medication from me as well.

I could honestly go on and on with how many times she's been disgustingly dirty, crossed my boundaries, or was just miserable to live with.

I finally had enough when one of my friends told me that she sent him unsolicited nudes. It was embarrassing and awkward, and I decided that I couldn't live like this anymore.

Here's where I may have been the AH: I was never on the official lease and would just Venmo her money every month. While she was at work, I grabbed all of my things and just dipped to my mom's house. She called me screaming and crying, but I told her I wasn't paying a single cent more to live there and that I was done.

She said I was an AH for not giving her warning and that it would be impossible to find a new roommate during the holidays. I told her I'd repeatedly talked to her about her behavior (for at least two months) and she never changed.

She just texted me though and said that she wasn't going to make rent this month and might get kicked out because of me. My brother says I should have given her at least a month of notice, and I am starting to feel a little guilty. I'm not sure what else I could have done though. Was I the AH?

**EDIT:** Some additional info: Two months ago I clearly expressed to my roommate that if she didn't change her behavior then I would be looking for another place to live. I also signed no documents regarding the lease, and she did mention to me a few times to not tell anyone I was renting from her because her landlord ""wouldn't like it"".

AITA for not buying my mom a birthday gift?,"My mom had a 50th bday not too long ago. I (26f) contacted all of her friends (including childhood friends that live abroad), her mom, her brother and sister and my dad's side of the family to ask them all to record her a few seconds to say happy bday. I then took all of those videos and made one video, which I put a lot of effort into editing, to show her on the actual bday date. In addition, I booked her and my dad everything for a vacation in EU they will go on to celebrate. I spent A LOT of hours both getting the numbers of people for the video, talking to them and explaining what I need, reminding them to send it, editing it, looking up flights, looking up good hotels, finding deals for the trip itself. I even made them a day-by day plan for which restaurants to eat in since I think that's  a huge part of experiencing another country. I even ended up choosing the gift my dad eventually got her.

Being a student, I don't have much money to spare. So when I asked her if there is anything I can get her, she said ""no, don't spend your money on me, it's ok."" I took it as it is, and figured doing all of the above would be enough, plus buying her nice chocolates and a greeting card. Come the day of her bday, she looked super happy for the video, and also me and my dad got her cake and a day at the spa. The next day tho, she looked kinda upset with me. When I poked the subject, she started with a whole speech about how me and my sister (who is younger and doesn't really have a job) don't care about her since we didn't buy her anything, and that turned into how no one cares about her birthday and we couldn't even throw her a party like we did for my dad 50th. (for info, my dad's family lives in our country, so it was easy to organize. her family is scattered around the world, and she dislikes my dad's side of the family.)

It is true that my dad got a party for his bday and a lot of gifts from his family (I also got him a really nice aftershave, but I was working fulltime back then, and didn't need his advice about what to buy/if it's ok to skip it). But I mean, I put A LOT of effort into making her day special regardless. I get why it can look unfair, but I thought she really understood my budget situation. Note that this is mostly about the gift, since she both emphasized it more and I honestly had no way of throwing her a party. AITA for not getting her a gift?",Not the A-hole
AITA for leaving our son with my husband so I could have a nap while his friends were over?,"My husband’s friends sometimes come over to spend time with him. They were here last Friday which I was fine with but our son wouldn’t go to sleep which was frustrating for me because I wanted to take a nap as for this pregnancy I’ve been constantly tired.

I tried to get him to go to sleep for an hour but I eventually gave up and took him outside where my husband was with his guests.

I’ll admit I wasn’t in the best mood so I told him he wouldn’t be able to smoke. It didn’t need to turn into a fight but it did because he was trying to guilt me into taking my son inside by telling me they were drinking and how they hadn’t seen my husband in ages and how I had already changed my husband’s life rapidly in less than 2 years so I should let him have one night with his friends.

WIBTA If I went to Europe without my husband.,"My youngest sister (30F) moved to Europe over 4 years ago and due to the pandemic and some other personal issues (unrelated to this) we haven't seen each other in person since she moved. Recently both my husband and I (40s) finally got our passports and have been planning to go and see her. My sister sent me some deals she found for tickets in March and I have enough saved to buy said tickets. The problem is that I could arrange my work schedule to leave for a week but my husband won't have enough PTO to leave the country until October. My sister suggested that I come by myself in March for a sisters' trip and then return in October with my husband for a couples trip. When I brought this idea up to my husband he responded with ""how would you like if I went to Europe without you?"" Though I can see why he would be upset, this trip for me is more about seeing my sister than it is about visiting the place where she lives. I told this to my sister and she said that we could save all the tourist type things for our couples trip and just spend the sisters trip hanging out at her house together if that would make him feel less like he is missing out. I really miss my sister and do not want to wait until October to see her but I also do not want my husband to feel left out either. It would be both of our first time to leave the country (USA) so I see why he would be upset to be left behind.

Some relevant info - both trips we would stay in my sister's guest room so we wouldn't need to pay for accomadations. Also my sister and husband get along very well. She lived with us as a teen and views my husband as a father figure, so there isn't any animosity between them.  I mentioned the sisters trip to our other sister who said that if I went in March to see our youngest sister that she would also like to go (though it is not 100% certain she would be able to)

So reddit what do you think? WIBTA if I went on this sisters trip by myself (or possible with my other sister) in March?

Edit to add info on the ticket prices since people are asking - the tickets my sister found in March are a great deal she found that are less than half the price the tickets normally are. (Ie normally $1000+ these are less than $500) If these tickets sale out before I make a decision then I probably will not go in March.

UPDATE - In case anyone is interested, I have decided to wait until October to spare my husband's feelings. I wanted to thank everyone for their input and for deeming me NTA. Some times one needs an outside perspective and I appreciate those who took the time to comment.",Not the A-hole

AITA for ditching my friends when we went out??,"On the last day of school for 2022, I (f15) invited 2 of my friends (both m15) to hang out  because one of them was leaving to another state (we will call the one leaving Mick, and the other one Owen).

For Info, Im pan, and I'm also good friends with Owens Girlfriend (we will call her annie).

Everything was good until Owen brought up the fact that he didn't like that I was friends with Annie as he thought that I was trying to steal her from him. I said not to worry because i was interested in someone else and Annie and I were just friends.

We let that go till we started walking to another blok of shops where both Mick and Owen started calling me a 'whore', I stated to both of them that in the past I don't like it when they call me that due to some personal reasons and they both disregard me saying I don't like being called it.

I will admit that what i said next wasn't really necessary, but i had enough and i said 'well least i'm not so insecure about my own relationship that I don't like my girlfriend and one of my friends being friends' (something along those lines)

after that he started ignoring me and so did Mick, they ended up running away when I was buying christmas Gifts, and straight out both started ignoring me. I tried talking to  them about it but Owen got really defensive and continued to ignore me.

I knew that 2 of my other friends were also at the same place so i went and tried to find them instead because i couldn't see why i should continue to hang out with Owen and Mick if they both ignored me and kept just running off.

Long story short, i found them, then Owen and Mick came back over and got mad and Owen started yelling at me and he tried to throw his drink can at me. At that point my other 2 friends had had enough and walked away and i joined them.

Ive spoken to some friends about it and they said Owen was being the AH, but i haven't spoken to Owen or Mick in almost 2 months. I feel like I overreacted but i'm not sure.

"AITA because I ""ignored"" a highschool classmate and years later I tried to befriend him?","I'm latin, so I apologize if my english isn't good enough. Btw this is a long story 

 When I was at the first years of highschool I had a classmate named ""Mike"" and he was the stereotype of the quiet guy at the bottom of the classroom. He always went to school approximately the first two weeks every quarter, no exceptions, and then he left for the rest of the quarter and appeared again before the last two weeks. Mike never speaked to anyone unless he had a group work, and even in those situations he limited to speak just the necessary and didn't socialize. 

I just had one ""friendly"" chat with Mike before pandemic isolation, and he was kinda making fun of me because I'm very silly and don't recognize jokes easily, so he made me think that he believed moon is a star. I have never been mad about and I realized of it 2 years later (during pandemic isolation) and it was fun to me.

The problem happened when Mike sent me a Facebook friendship solicitude, and I accepted because ""why not?"". We started talking through messenger for a while and I realized his likes were very similar to mine and my friends' (anime, videogames and stuff like that) so I decided to add it to our messenger chat group (which we almost not use because we rarely talk through messenger, but we were talking a little through it in that time). The thing didn't go very sweet at first because some of my friends didn't even know him or remember who he was which made Mike upset. It went very bad quickly because Mike started saying ""we never turned to look at him and become his friends because nobody cared about him"" and ""when he arrives, everyone get quiet"" and stuff like that. After he said that my friends were very upset and begun telling him it wasn't their fault and he had no right to come and begin to say it was our fault he had no friends.

Mike got out from the chat group by himself and I felt guilty because that situation was my fault by trying to introduce him, even when I didn't know him good enough and I didn't know what was going to happen.

I went to talk to him by private chat and kindly explained him why he was wrong to act like that, and he seemed to understand it very well. So we kept chatting rarely by messenger because as I said before, I use messenger very rarely.

Then one day I commented one of his posts in Facebook and he replied me very agresively. When I asked him why he was that agresive to me and he told me that ""I had never cared about him so I wasn't able to be his friend"". Then I unfriended him and since then I know nothing about him.

AITA because I never tried to be his friend before, because maybe he could have joined before to me and my friends and he hadn't end up alone without any friend, and because I got him into the chat group?

I wanna add some info: He and his family are immigrants and they have already shifted the country they live thrice so he had not the chance to make any friend (If he even tried). And some of my friends and old classmates had a similar situation with him.",Not the A-hole

The vacation has been planned weeks in advance. All of the boys’ parents paid me for the plane tickets and I’ve already bought them. There is a fifth boy in this group, Nick (fake name). Nick wasn’t able to afford the ticket. Nick’s mother called me and said the other three boys (not my son, who tried to get them to stop) rubbed it in his face that he wasn’t able to go. She said she called each of the boys’ parents and they made their sons apologize to Nick but she tried to get them to withdraw their sons from the trip as punishment and they refused. She said I’m the only one who can stop this trip now. I was put in a spot, because they aren’t my sons and it’s not my place to discipline them (and I later confirmed from their parents that they’ve all been disciplined by being grounded for a week or more, just not enough for Nick’s mom). I later politely told her I can’t, but she’s been repeatedly texting me saying it’s the only way to make what they did right. My son was upset with his friends’ behavior, but he’s still really excited to go. I thought about if I want him to have friends like that, but despite this, I know they’re fundamentally nice kids and he still loves them.

"AITA for telling my brother his ""advice"" is criticism?","I (40f) have a brother, Dean (46) and a younger sister Bex (32). Relevant info is that he is Bex's goddad. We are NOT religious, it was more tradition than anything else. They are not close. He has kinda pulled away from our family at every opportunity and he barely made an effort to attend Bex's wedding. Bex, it must also be said, is the best adult I've ever met (better than me), so responsible and caring. She and brother are both doctors. That's all the background.

Bex is now pregnant with her first child and she was fortunate enough to score a first class upgrade on a flight for Christmas. She texted the family to say she was only sorry she couldn't indulge in the free booze. Then, about five minutes later, she texted that she was going to treat herself to one glass of champagne.

My brother took that opportunity after having exactly one thing to say in the group text in months, which was to say she had better not drink because she could cause fetal alcohol syndrome to her baby. She pushed back and invited him to bring evidence to her door that one drink would cause FAS and politely ignored him continuing to harass her. I told him in the group text to drop it, please.

Privately, I messaged him to be like WTF dude??? I had read this awesome assessment from a public speaker who said ""unsolicited advice is criticism, always.""

AITA for being angry that my SO keeps telling me I´m autistic,"On multiple occasions, my SO will tell me that I´m autistic, that I need help, and that she is going to get me this help. 

For background info, we both have people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder in close family, and we have lived together for 2 years. I have been tested as an adolescent during the time my siblings were diagnosed, to be on the safe side, but the psych team determined I did not meet the diagnostic criteria. SO knows this. SO is also a first year psych student. 

The times she tells me I´m autistic are times where she feels I don´t show emphaty for what she´s going through in the right way. It was one time she asked for space, and I gave it to her, and it boiled to an argument over me not caring about her. She said it´s fine, because I was autistic, and it´s not my fault. 

That sort of thing happens a lot, she says I don´t have empathy for her and I tell her I do feel for her, but she needs to tell me what she needs from me in those situations, because people need different things when they´re going through some stuff. I can´t recall ever getting a good ""this is what I need"".

We also had an argument over some kids being upset at a rule my work implemented. I work in a grocery store and during school hours, school kids are not allowed to use self-checkout because of numerous incidents with scanning too few items etc. It´s a rule the store manager and principal of the school right next to us agreed on. I said I didn´t understand why those kids were so angry, when they know as well as us that stealing has been an issue with the school. They resorted to name-calling us employees and showing the finger. I found it all amusing that they were so angry over something seemingly so minor, but my SO said I didn´t have empathy for the kids, and that it´s unfair that innocent kids are being punished along with the kids who steal. I mean, I get that, but we´re not really taking away any major rights from them. They can still shop, they just have to go to a cashier. But my SO said because I couldn´t empathize, I was autistic.

I´m not good at small talk, and the comment often comes after a taxi ride, when we meet someone we know in public, or when we´ve had visitors/been visiting someone, because I´m not great at talking with people. I acknowledge this, that I often can´t keep up a conversation, but I don´t find it grounds for a diagnosis. 

I´ve told her I don´t like the accusation, time and time again, but it keeps on happening. It´s not that I find something inherently wrong with having that diagnosis either, it´s just that it isn´t me, and I also pride myself on having a great sense of empathy (which other people in my life tell me I have). 

So AITA for being angry in this situation? A part of me tells me that I should get tested again, as an adult, and that maybe it comes from a place of real concern.

AITA for not being being angry at my friend for cheating?,"This one's pretty short but I'll try to give enough info for you folks. 

One of my best friends, M, had been dating a guy for a few years now and frankly, it wasn't great. The relationship was pretty toxic, if not outright abusive. I had been gently encouraging her to get out of that situation as best I can from a distance. Within the last 3 months, she ended up breaking down and called me, admitting she had found another guy and had been sleeping with him behind her (now ex) boyfriends back. She told me she was planning on moving in with this new guy soon.

 My response was... mixed I think. Usually my stance on cheating is a pretty hard absolutely not. And while I mean it wasn't great to hear she cheated, I was more glad she was getting away from him. I offered to come help her move her stuff out and support her the best I could. She's now a lot happier where she is and is doing a lot better. 

This is the potential AH part. One of my other friends found out about her cheating from M's ex and got in touch with me to gossip. I was trying to avoid the subject because I'm not one to gossip but it came out that I knew about her cheating before the breakup went public. I got called a lot of things by them including a hypocrite because I of my nirmally very hardline stance on cheating. I insisted that the situation was different but didn't go into details because it isn't my place to make allegations about abuse. That's for M to talk about, if she ever does. 

So am I an asshole for not keeping to my stance on cheating? I think I can swallow the hypocrite accusation since my reaction does fly in the face of my normal stance on cheating, but I don't think my actions were particularly asshole-ish.

Info edit: in the past I've distanced myself from friends who have cheated or treated cheating as not a big deal or not wrong at all.

WIBTA if I tell my brother's ex's kids to stop calling me 'uncle'?,"When I (30's M) was a teenager, my older brother (Dave) had a long term girlfriend (Kelly). She was pregnant with some unknown guy's baby already, and when the baby (Mary) was born, my brother had his name put as the father on her birth certificate.

Dave and Kelly never married, and despite no blood relation, I've always seen Mary as my niece and part of the family, while I've always seen Kelly as a distant relation given she and my brother eventually broke up.

Kelly and Mary have always been welcome at family events ever since, even though my brother Dave has married (and divorced) another woman and had his own son with her. The problem is that these days I cannot stand Kelly. She's had 4 other children, all with a different fathers, and she's extremely controlling of all of them, especially Mary. Mary is an adult now and basically is babysitter to her brothers and sisters while Kelly goes out and parties all she wants. Kelly and her kids live out of state now and often come for the holidays because they know that they'll get free food and lodging with my parents, and that my parents are fine buying gifts for all of Kelly's kids, even if they only see the oldest Mary as their grandchild (something they've not told Kelly) and buy her more gifts than the other children.

The thing is, Kelly has told all of her kids that my parents are grandparents to them all, and that I am their uncle, without asking me or my parents how we felt about this. I don't even know the names of her 4 other kids (a whole range of ages from early teens to toddlers), but last time I saw them, they were all directed to run up and hug me because ""I'm their uncle"". This was disconcerting to me because I don't know any of them, and I frankly don't want to. I'm already an uncle to my older sister's kids, Mary, and Dave's other child.

&#x200B;

My dilemma:

I hate what Kelly has done without my permission, and next time I see them I want to make it clear that I'm not their uncle. It's uncomfortable because I don't know them, I wasn't part of their upbringing like I was with Mary, and their mother never married into our family and her other kids only see us at most, once a year, and my brother Dave's name is not on their birth certificates.

My brother Dave is absolutely fine with what Kelly has done, and my parents keep their opinions to themselves. If I get vocal about not calling me their uncle, it will be during the holidays (the only time I see them), and the finger would be pointed at me for making everyone upset because I won't go along with being given a title that doesn't belong to me. This would prompt Dave to get up in my face about it because I made some non-relations cry, even it was to correct someone else's lie.

I also have an older sister who agrees with me, that we are not the aunt and uncle of my brother's ex's other kids. My parent's already know how I feel and I've instructed them to NEVER give my phone number to Kelly because I plain and simple cannot stand her.

&#x200B;

Edit: A little more info about Kelly. First, she would absolutely make a big deal out of this, as she's the kind of person to get professionally offended. Second, when she does bring her kids around for the holidays, she's constantly mooching off my parents. If my parents are going out for diner, she acts like she and her kids are automatically invited along, even though she doesn't have enough money to cover them all, and then my parents end up paying for them even though they don't want to. My parents want Mary to keep coming around, but they know if they piss off Kelly, she won't bring her.",Not the A-hole

She tells me has decided to do a ""combo party"" since their birthdays are so close to each other. I was a little surprised and said I didn't think that was a good idea. She asked why and I said I didn't think it was fair to either of them to have to split their birthday. She said that my nephew is too little to need a full on party just for him,  and my niece ""loves her brother and will probably be happy to share the day with him.""

I told her it wasn't about loving her brother or not, it was about making sure she had her own special day. A lot has changed for her since (nephew) was born, so I didn't think it was right to essentially take away the one thing that is still just hers. My sister got upset, and started yelling at me that I didn't know how expensive it was to raise children, and so unless I was willing to open my wallet, I needed to keep my opinions to myself. I told her I would be happy to pay for the parties, if she wanted to plan something and then just let me know so I could book things and pay. I think she wasn't expecting me to actually offer to pay, because then she screamed that I didn't understand and hung up the phone. 

A few hours later I got a call from our mom, saying my sister had called her sobbing saying I said she was a bad mom?!? I told her I said nothing of the sort, and that I'd just said I didn't think it was fair of her to split niece's and nephew's birthday. She said they aren't my kids and so its not my decision, and I needed to call and apologize to my sister for upsetting her like I did. I told her I had no intention of apologizing and my mom said that I'd better consider it, because if I don't it's likely sister will not invite me to niece's/nephews birthday party.

AITA? My sister is one of those ""birthday week"" people who has to make the days leading up to and the days immediately following her birthday all about her, so I know she would never be okay with splitting her own birthday, yet somehow she thinks it's ok to do to my niece? I don't want to miss out on my niece's and nephew's birthdays though, so if I'm genuinely the one in the wrong I will apologize to her.",Not enough info
AITA for not giving my “friend” money?,"My (22F) “friend” (36f) asked me for money about 30 minutes ago. 

For context, I don’t give out money because no one pays me back and I’ve set boundaries with people, especially friends and family, that I will give them money if they desperately need it. 

So my friend, let’s call her D, asked me for money. Now D has been my friend for nearly 4 years, and every time I’ve given her money, she’s never paid it back. She owes me nearly $250 and asked if I could give her some money for food (about $35). 


I told her no, that she still owes me money, I don’t just give money out, and I need the money for registering my car. I know most of her money goes towards rent and her other bills, but she doesn’t get paid much as she’s on government benefits (disability). 

Here’s where I might be the asshole, she’s about to have her storage unit terminated because she hasn’t paid rent on it for 4 weeks, she also lives in a motel because her mum kicked her out.  When she first got kicked out, I helped her get away from her mum and organised her a place to stay, a small cabin on my uncle property he was happy to let her stay until she figured something out. 
Then I dropped her off at one of her other friends place, and didn’t ask for fuel money or anything else because I knew she was in a tight spot. 
She then moved into the motel she is currently in and has been there for nearly a year. 
She also has a dog, who is her companion animal. She has food in her fridge, and food for her dog. 
She has proceeded to guilt trip me into giving her money but I am holding my ground. 

So reddit, AITA in this situation?

AITA for telling my brother he needs to move out?,"I (17F) live with my Dad (53) my mother (48) my little brother (14) my older brother (21) and his girlfriend (18F who will be known as L.) 
He ruins our lives. He is a drug addict who makes everybody’s lives worse. He has been all over my country looking for places to stay, but as soon as he runs out of money he runs back home to mommy. let me make this clear. we are not well off. we are poor, and my mother, father, and I all have jobs trying to support our family. we do not have the room to accomodate whenever he is here, and he cannot hold down a job. he pays for weed, but can’t pay board. every other day he demands that my mother take him and L places, looking for weed and to buy vapes. he gets angry whenever my father brings up the fact that he needs to get a job, and L is just as bad. 

to him we are a halfway house, and he does not respect our boundaries. he claims to have no money, but as I’ve stated he buys weed with it, and doesn’t pay board. He will come to me, knowing I have money and beg for it. He claims he will pay me back but he does not. He already owes me $200. I feel bad for saying no because he claims to need it, but i don’t want his dirty money. (he also sells the weed that he buys.) 

He gets angry whenever anyone brings up anything about him moving out, throwing a tantrum and will yell at us, scream at us, only to come running back when he realised no-one else will take him and L in. They have been down to L’s parents, but they got kicked out because, again, he refused to get a job and pay board. 

The last straw happened a couple of weeks ago. He got angry and started yelling at me, claiming that I won’t sell my Xbox to him because i hate him and that i wanted him to die. I did not say anything. He then stated he was going to smash my ps5 (that i paid for myself) along with my oculus, and my nintendo. all paid for by me. (including the xbox.) Mum and I left the house out of frustration, and we came back to my ps5 out on the lawn, thankfully not smashed, but my nintendo and my oculus were gone. I asked him where they were, and he started accusing me of not trusting him. i was right not to, as L ended up telling me that he had taken them and stashed them as a way to get back at me. I saw red and started yelling at him, telling him that he needs to move out already and to stop touching my stuff. he started yelling at me, calling me a bitch and all sorts that I won’t say here. My parents aren’t happy with me but I don’t see the problem. Am I the asshole?

AITA For telling my mom she's insane for trying to get pregnant again?,"For context: I (22M) have 2 siblings (22F and 23F) and I am the youngest (the youngest twin). But we are all adults now. 

This all started a few years ago when my oldest sister got pregnant with my nephew. It was the first baby of our generation and of course everyone was overjoyed it was a boy because they are so rare in the family.

I won't sugar coat it. My sister was spoiled during her pregnancy. She was driven to all her doctors appointments, nearly every day someone was buying something new, with every craving someone was ready to go get it, and she even had 2 baby showers. When my nephew was born it was the happiest my family had been since my grandma died. 

My mom, however, wasn't. 

Everytime someone would do something for my sister, she expected it for herself. I remember I bought my sister a pedicure and paid extra for a foot massage and my mother was pissed at me for days for not getting her one. ""I'm the baby's grandma!"" She would say constantly. 

We all ignored it for the sake of my nephew. 

Well, my mom just recently sat me and my siblings down and explained how she wanted to try getting pregnant again. She wasn't asking us our opinion, more like informing us that it was going to happen. My sister was excited for someone who could be a playmate for her son. My twin was hesitant and I was livid. For privacy reasons I won't give my mother's medical history, but just that is enough for concern not to mention the fact that she's 40+ years old. 

I asked her how she planned to live if she couldn't work while pregnant as my father has never been in the picture. ""Well one of my kids shouldn't mind taking care of me.""

I asked her how she planned to take care of a baby when she's back to work. ""Someone in the family can babysit.""

I asked her how she planned on buying baby stuff because she's not good with saving money at all. ""Everyone will pitch in for the baby like they did with your sister."" 

And no. They wouldn't. My mom has burned quite a lot of bridges for her emotional immaturity. And one very high risk pregnancy will not change that. Not to mention the fact that my siblings and I were raised by our grandparents because she couldn't. 

So I sat her down and tried to explain how this would be a terrible idea for everyone involved. But she got upset and started yelling about how I need to be supportive and I'm just jealous because I won't be the youngest anymore. I let my emotions get ahead of me and I called her insane and left. 

My siblings and family have called to tell me I need to apologize and that I was way out of line. I ""don't have to like her trying for another baby but I need to be supportive."" Which I feel would be the case if we were talking about literally anyone else. But nobody else thinks the same. 

So, AITA?

Edit for info: Idk how my mom intends to get pregnant. She Wouldnt be approved for IVF and she's never had a consistent relationship. My guess is that she's just planning on sleeping around. Also she's 43 going on 44. My guess is shes counting on the ""it takes a village"" mindset to help her with a child. 

My sister got special treatment for being pregnant because (1) she was having a boy, (2) because she was busting her ass as a single mother, student, and working full time, (3) her baby's father was a POS who dipped.",Not the A-hole
AITA for wanting to move out and away from my family?,"TL:DR, I'm finishing high school and want to move into my own place to get away from my family only issue is that we have very limited funds. 

So I am 19 and this is my last year in high school. (I did a pathways program as I have medical conditions) my younger sister is also doing her last year in high school. I'm going to be going to university next year as will she, we don't know where exactly as it depends on final marks but I want to live by myself.  the only problem is that we (my mum, sister and I)  have limited money and if I lived by myself then it would probably mean that my mum would end up moving back in with my grandparents. The reason I want to live by myself is mostly because we seem to constantly butt heads, they don't like my boyfriend, I am tired of having to deal with them not liking him and I don't like my mum's boyfriend who stays over for weeks at a time. I'm not looking at anything fancy as long as there's hot water and a kitchen I'd be happy but I can't help but feel bad for wanting my own space. Can someone please give me their opinion?

AITA for throwing out my sister-in-law’s drugs?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.  

Honestly I’m mostly writing this to get my frustrations out and to get a second opinion. My (F25) SIL (21F) is an avid pot smoker. I, personally, don’t really take any issue with it. I don’t do any substances, and she’s relatively tidy and discrete, so for the most part I leave her be. From what I know, she frequents this place that gives her a lot of free samples, and they come in these innocuous, plain, vacuum-sealed baggies. I’m a stay at home wife, so the bulk of my day is spent tidying things up & keeping things clean, especially after I cook. She’s at uni most of the day, almost every day, so our paths don’t cross frequently even though we live under the same roof. 

My husband’s birthday party was recently, and I decided to bake him a homemade cake. It was a huge hit at the get-together we had with his family. I spent *hours* on prep work, baking, decorating, and cleaning up, and I have to say the hard work paid off. We had lots of fun and everything seemed good. A couple hours after everyone had left and things died down, SIL comes into our room, frantically asking if either me or my husband had seen one of her baggies. We’re both unsure, and brush it off because we figure she misplaced it while high or something. She leaves, huffy, and asks us again an hour later. 

SIL said that she’d left it on the countertop a couple of days ago, and it suddenly dawns on me that I may have accidentally tossed it along with the parchment paper and piping bags. Husband had taken the trash out after the get-together, so the garbage can was empty. She throws a complete fit, accusing me of all sorts of things, questioning whether or not it was actually an accident (it was, I would never touch someone else’s things). I was very hurt, and told her that she shouldn’t have left it on the counter to begin with, and that it was free so what does it matter anyway? She’ll just get another one next time she returns to the shop, plus I’m sure she has a lot of pot in her room anyways (I did not say that last part out loud). 

My husband got out of bed to comfort her and to help her look for it in the bin outside, and was cold when he returned. SIL has refused to speak with me for days. I just don’t understand why they are both so upset about a simple misunderstanding, but I see how I may have acted immaturely when speaking to her.

A few months ago my in-laws (who I love) moved to a small HOA community nearby.  We love having them close.  The problem came in that they have an RV they don't have room for.

I don't know if they asked or we volunteered to store it for them, but the deal was made that we would store it for them and occasionally get to use it.

We took out a loan to put in an RV pad to keep it on.  They donated 10% towards paying for it.

Here we are 4 months later, FIL has decided to sell the RV for a nice profit.

My wife and I have a great RV pad, but no RV to borrow.  We also have a loan now to pay off which we wouldn't have undertaken had we known he was going to change his mind about being a RV owner.

"AITA for telling my mum to fuck off and refusing to have my sisters kids at my wedding, despite my daughter being there?","Title is long so apologies, throwaway and names changed.

I’m (28f) due to marry my fiancé Dean (30m) in a month. We’ve been together for 11 years and have a girl Ella(5). Important info, Ella has autism, high functioning. She’s incredibly quiet, keeps to herself, very polite and acts more mature than some adults I know. Obviously we want her there, she just wants to go as a guest, thats fine. She is the only child under 16 allowed at our wedding. 

I was talking to mum the other day about final plans when she asked me about childcare for Ella. I was confused as we’ve made it clear from the start Ella would be there, to which mum said that ‘as sis isn’t allowed to bring her kids, we assumed Ella wouldn’t be there either because of their autism.’ 

BS on sis (F34.) She has twins, M&F 7. When they were 3, her ex caught her cheating, dna test done, kids weren’t his, he left, she’s been a single mum since. Before he left, the kids were well behaved. Had manners, knew right from wrong etc. Once he left she gave up parenting. When Ella got diagnosed a year ago, she came up with the notion that her kids are also autistic. They are not, she has taken them to multiple specialists, they have all said they don’t have any mental disabilities. I know this because she moans that no one takes her seriously. She saw the same specialist that Ella saw and she told me that she’s incompetent as she could diagnose my kid but not hers.

Her kids act up a lot. E.g no one invites them to birthdays as last time, they had tantrums as they couldn’t open the birthday boys presents and had to be stopped from smashing the cake in retaliation. If they aren’t centre of attention they scream at the top of their lungs. I had to ban them from my house because the last time they visited they destroyed Ella’s favourite books because she said no to them playing with her toys. I do not want these kids at my wedding because i know they will act up, and sis won’t do anything because ‘they’re autistic, I can’t discipline them, they don’t understand.’ Luckily hers aren’t the only kids under 16 so she can’t claim I’ve singled them out.

I explained to mum, Ella was the only exemption from the rule as she’s ours. She suggested that maybe its best Ella stays home so my sisters kids wont feel left out. I politely told her no, and explained the other reasons for not wanting them there, but she kept insisting it was the right thing to do, or remove the rule for my sisters kids. After some back and fourth i had enough and just snapped. I told her to fuck off, just because my sister was her favourite didnt mean she had to have everything about her/ her kids, and especially not at MY wedding. 

Mum left upset at me, now i have her and sis up my ass about it, mum saying to either leave Ella at home or let sis bring her kids. Sis because i said the kids misbehave. Dean is on my side, and joked about just uninviting them both, which I’m seriously considering now. But AITA here?

Update! So both I and Dean have been going through all the comments (or at least as many as we could, there have been so many.) We have decided against letting either my mum or sis come to the wedding. I made sure to message the venue and all my vendors setting a password that only we know and will be looking into hiring security for the big day. Luckily the way the venue is set out means it will be impossible for them to possibly sneak in and it will be made clear to security who to look out for.

Now onto mum… oh boy, to say she blew up is an understatement. She actually came over this morning again to try and force me to make either choice and i calmly made her aware that i am rescinding both of their invitations as I cannot trust them. At first she didn’t seem to believe me but when i stuck to my guns she started shouting at me that i was cruel, heartless, im playing favourites (with my own kid? of course she’s my favourite and I’m gonna choose her!.)  I was the worst daughter ever and if thats how I was going to be then I can pretend I didn’t have a mum anymore. 

I’ll be honest, i thought hearing that would hurt, but surprisingly it didn’t. I just shrugged and said ‘fine, I’ll pretend I don’t have a sister either, goodbye.’ I’ve never seen my mum speechless, so i just steered her to my front door, gave her a small shove out, and closed the door before she could retaliate. She did bang on the door for a bit but i refused to answer and she gave up. I have now blocked both her and my sister on everything. As well as made a post explaining whats been going on to everyone close to me on Facebook. Luckily most of them also don’t like my sister so I shouldn’t get any pushback from that.

Once we’ve have the wedding I’ll give an update, if anything interesting happens and there is one to give obviously. But thank you everyone for the words of encouragement!",Not the A-hole
AITA for not paying my friends speeding ticket?,"So I was out with some friends this weekend. Tina was our driver for the night.  My friend Ashley went to Tina's house and left her car there. My house is on the way so they picked me up. At the end of the night I was dropped off back home and said ""good night, be safe texting me when you get home."" Well they got home and forgot to text me. The next day Tina texted me that she got pulled over after dropping me off and got a speeding ticket. She said it was an expensive ticket and asked if I would help pay for it since she was nice enough to pick me up and drive us around.

 Side note we all take turns driving no one asks for gas money or anything as we keep it equal and whoever drives gets their dinner paid for. I thought she was joking and said ""lol why? Did I somehow make you speed after I left?"" She got offended and said it was only fair since she drove and Ashley was helping her pay for it. I said okay good for her but not only was it not my fault she was speeding I wasn't even in the car. Why would I, in anyway be responsible? 
She said that I was a terrible friend for not helping pay for her ticket. Later Ashley texted me saying that I was not being a good friend for not helping Tina out with the ticket. I again said I didn't make her speed and I wasn't even there. Both are now not talking me. A mutual friend agrees with me and has said it was ridiculous for her to even ask and that if Ashley wants to help fine but I have no obligation to.

Update: yikes so here we go. I heard from Ashley who was informing me she is done with Tina. It turns out Tina was scamming. Some info I didn't add as it wasn't relevant at the time. Tina is a SAHM and lives with her bf. Ashley and I work full time. Ashley went over last night to babysit for Tina while she and bf went out for their anniversary. While Tina was getting ready, Ashley and Tina's bf were talking. He says that they wouldn't even be going out tonight if not for their anniversary due to him having to pay for her speeding ticket. Ashley casually says oh did my portion not help enough? I know (my name) didn't help but do you need more? 
He says what do you mean? I'm paying for the ticket Tina didn't say she asked you to pay. So they call Tina in and ask her whats going on. Turns out Tina was always going to have her bf pay the ticket. She was planning on pocketing the money so she could have some spending money since she doesn't work and we do. She for some reason felt since we make an income it wasn't a big deal for us to give her money. 
She and Ashley got in a fight. Tina's bf was angry because he gives her money. Ashley has said she can't be friends with someone trying to essentially steal money from her. So we are all pretty much done with Tina for her behavior.

AITA for refusing to pay my friend's boyfriend for a freelance job he quit?,"First I apologize for any mistakes, my first language isn't English. 

In 2020/2021 I submitted a cultural project to get government funds. We got approved, and a friend (Meg) said I should hire her boyfriend (Joe), because he was really good at project management. I took note, but couldn't hire at the time. A few weeks later the government fund thing announced we could request to increase the budget for our project by 50%. We needed to submit the request by the end of the week, and my business partner (Ana) wasn't answering any of my calls. I was new to this sort of project, and was afraid of messing anything up, so I thought I could give Joe a try. We talked over the phone, he gave me tips and ideas to create the request for the new budget. I made the request, it was approved, now we could hire Joe to manage the project. 

During the first weeks we had a few video call meetings, but Joe wanted me to go to his home for an irl meeting. It was covid times, so I didn't want an irl meeting. I also didn't really see the need for the meeting. We would have a 20 min video calls that helped nothing. He would always insist we talk via phone, video calls, or irl, while I would rather send messages or audio. I was still pretty lost in the project, I never managed any projects, and I told him ""Sorry, I am not sure what I want from you in this project"". He got pretty mad, and dropped out of the project. I apologized and asked him what I could do to keep him in the project. No answer.

While he was in the project, I asked several times about his payment, and he always ignored the question, or brushed it off. 

The project ran a lot more smoothly without him. After the project had been delivered, me and Ana sat down to talk about this ""extra"" money left on the budget, and we decided to use the money to pay Meg for a costume she lent us, to pay Joe an amount we thought as good enough, and to pay a bit extra to a someone we felt didn't receive enough money. 

First I messaged Meg, then I messaged Joe telling him ""hey, we decided to pay you X, can you send me your acc info for transfer?"" 
I believe 3 weeks later Joe replied saying the amount I was offering was too little, and that he should get, at least, double the amount offered, mostly when compared to the fact that I paid Meg, for a ""nothing job"". I paid Meg X and paid Joe 2X. I told him we couldn't increase the value anymore, and paid him the small amount. 

Since then, it's been hard between me and Meg. She says he complains about me to her. He says I didn't pay him more because SHE didn't insist enough I paid him. I rarely see Meg anymore, and a few days ago she brought this question up again. She asked ""Why didn't you pay Joe what he asked for? We really needed the money at the time."" I tried explaining that the only time he asked for a specific amount of money was 3 weeks after I offered a value, and at that point there was no money left in the project.",Not the A-hole

The place is a 1 bedroom and 1 den condo.  I live out of the den. 

She is demanding I pay 50%.

AITA For not putting my mom down as a beneficiary,"So I tend to be pretty blunt and probably didn’t handle this great but I do need a tie breaker.

Two weeks ago I (27F) started my dream job. It’s nothing glamorous or super high paying but it’s a step in that direction. Salary wise I make what both my parents make combined annually. And part of my benefits package is a company paid life insurance policy that pays out a years salary to my beneficiary of my choosing.

I’m single with no kids and I live with my parents. I have an older brother who is a mess and a nephew from said brother who is 8.

My brother is horrible with money, can’t keep a job to save his life and is behind on child support payments. He also doesn’t have primary custody of my nephew.

My nephews mom has three other kids with all different dads, lives off welfare and multiple child support payments.

Because of this putting my nephew down as a beneficiary doesn’t seem like a good option until he’s at least 18.

In my moms eyes my brother can do no wrong. She will bend over backwards to give him money if he needs it. He didn’t have the same opportunities to go to college as me so it’s not fair to expect so much of him. We were raised by the same parents in the same house with the same budget he just chose to drop out of community college to get married at 20. On top of this my mom had a lot of family in Mexico and she sends more than half of her paycheck to keep all of her siblings and nephews over there housed, fed… etc. when they are all older, have their own homes and kids that help them out as well. She’s just bad with money and never even checks her bank account as long as the card gets approved it’s all good in her eyes. It’s for this reason that my mom and dad separated their finances.

My dad is the one that pays the bills, keeps everyone on track. He is strict and tough but he will never leave my brother or nephew on the streets. We have the same priorities as in keeping our household afloat and only helping others when it’s okay and they absolutely need it.

So yesterday I asked my dad for his info to put him down as my sole beneficiary. I explained to him why I was doing this and what I would like him to do with the cash should anything happen to me. It’ll be a safety net for the family. Not to be used to pay child support or any divorces or custody battles my brother may have in the future that’s his responsibility. No sending money to relatives in other countries. I’ve only met them once in my whole life and they can take care of themselves. And if there is enough down the line, to help pay for my nephews college if he chooses to go when the time comes.

My dad agreed. My mom on the other hand did not. She overheard the whole thing and is now mad I wouldn’t put her down as a beneficiary. Like passive aggressively.

AITA for telling my step-dad that he can't make dad jokes because he's not a dad?,"My (16M) dad passed away when I was 3, I honestly don't remember him and I don't have a strong hold to his memory, I'm not close to his family and the only person who talked to me about him was my mom, until she didn't. She married my step-dad when I was 8, I'm also not close to him because he's a douche, he has this ''savior complex'' where he thinks he's a hero for ''being there'' for a fatherless kid, truth is, I despise him because I only exist in the spectrum of being ''rescued and helped'' and not a fucking normal person. 

He always introduces me as his son or his boy, he and my mom don't have any kids and I'm the only child in the household. I don't call him dad or anything. 

Last week, we were having dinner with his family and he was talking shit about some stuff I did (I love to paint and I sometimes sell these paintings, nothing big, but makes me happy. He's an engineer so he thinks that what I do is pointless and ridiculous because art is ''no good''. My mom and him thinks this is tough love and will help me, I say he can get fucked). I was honestly getting fed up, but remained quiet because it was pointless to fight so I just kept eating. 

He then made ''a joke'', and nobody laughed except for my mom, I guess he felt put in the spot and said ''Sorry, after 8 years I can't still make a good dad joke'' and that was it. I dropped my fork and said ''No shit, \[step-dad's name\], maybe you can't make a dad joke because you're no dad.'' and got up and left. I spend the night at my friend's house \[I texted my mom\] and then when I came back, they gave me grief. He's still expecting an apology and said that we'll be attending therapy and shit. Dunno, AITA?",Not the A-hole
AITA for giving my husband a fake when he demanded to drive my car?,"**EDIT TITLE: I meant to ask: AITA For giving my husband fake key when he demanded to drive my car?. I'm sorry I made some errors. title can't be edited.**




I (f#31) became the only income earner after my husband Jeff (m#35) lost his job about 9 months ago. He doesn't have a car anymore because he sold it to be able to pay off debts.


He started asking to drive my car with the excuse of wanting to look for a job. there are 2 problems with this...first is that I'm a nurse I work odd hours and need my car most of the time and he literally takes it all day and comes back late in the evening. second is that every time he comes home the car either has a busted taillight, damaged front, flat tires etc, etc, etc.

So far I had to spend nearly $300 bucks to get it back in good shape. I told him I no longer want him to take my car but he said I had to let him drive it so he could continue to look for a job. I told him he could search online but he said something about scammers trying to pose as potential employers just to get his personal info (never had this happen to us).


Days ago, he went out with my car and I ended up being late for my shift. I called a friend to cover for me and tried to call him but he returned home at midnight. I had a fight with him after he said he was with friends and time passed by. I took the key of the car and put it under my pillow then went to sleep.

The next morning I saw him standing near the bed wanting me to give him the car key so he could go ""lOoK fOr A jOb"" I said no but he got mad and started demanding I hand it over. I told him FINE and pointed towards the sock drawer where we had lots of junk and told him it was there. I lied and he got some old key that looked like it. Once he walked out I locked the door and got in bed. Few minutes later he came back and started pounding on the door asking if I gave him a fake key. I said I did just to get him off of my back..he started yelling at me saying I was being childish and demanded I open the door and give him the real key. I remained in bed while he kept yelling outside saying I'm giving him lot of shit for not working YET not willing to let him *effectively* look for a job. He also said that I'd been testing his patience several times and he's had about enough. he yelled some more then left.

I was so infuriated and just maddened about the whole situation. I had a shift to cover and I knew that if he took the car then he won't bring it back in time. I got to my work and we haven't talked. He was in full sulking mode after I returned and kept ranting about how unsupportive and childish I was to pull this stunt.",Not the A-hole
